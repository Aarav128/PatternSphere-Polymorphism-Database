(210, 200, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'The human race has multiplied tremendously since its origins in Africa millions of years ago. During its stay on earth, it has changed the world dramatically through social and technological innovation.  In spite of great success in increasing its numbers and gaining dominion over much of the planet, the problems that humankind has created &#150; war, famine, environmental degradation, injustice, and a host of others &#150; may be  increasingly immune to its attempts to correct them. Unfortunately there is ample evidence that the economic and political elites of the world are not able &#150; or <i>willing</i> &#150; to actually address these problems effectively, humanely, and ecologically responsibly. Civil society is emerging as an important force to address these problems, but in spite of best intentions civil society efforts are often disjointed, duplicative, inflexible, ineffectual and destructively competitive.', 'The social and the natural environment face profound challenges at the dawn of the 21st Century. Society often develops intelligent collective responses to collective problems &#150; often through citizen activism. Civil society and \"ordinary citizens\" are often at the forefront of the creation and adoption of new paradigms, ideas, tactics and technologies that are used to address shared problems and create a better future.', 'In early 2003, days before the United States invaded Iraq, Robert Muller, former assistant secretary general of the United Nations, called attention to the incipient potential of the citizenry: Never before in the history of the world has there been a global visible, public, viable, open dialogue and conversation about the very legitimacy of war. He was describing the unprecedented movement that arose simultaneously in hundreds of places around the world. What this movement represents is the advent of an immensely powerful force. Muller called it a \"merging, surging, voice of the people of the world.\" As an expression of pent-up desire and a will to work for a better world, it\'s also a manifestation of <i>civic intelligence.</i>\r\n\r\nTo meet the need for civic problem solving, governments, companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) citizens and \"ordinary\" people are beginning to acknowledge the vast problems that humankind now faces and devising new strategies, tactics and paradigms to help ameliorate them. To help with these daunting tasks a growing array of socio-technical information and communication systems are being developed. People and organizations need both general paradigms and specific ideas to help them devise tactics and strategies that further their objectives while working cooperatively with other people and organizations. \r\n\r\n<i>Civic intelligence,</i> like Daniel Goleman\'s <i>Emotional Intelligence</i>, or the various types of intelligences identified by Howard Gardner in <i>Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences</i> (or even, <i>erotic</i> intelligence, the cover story in a recent edition of the <i>Utne Reader</i>), can be used to explore &#150; and <i>invigorate</i> &#150; a flexible and powerful competence that goes beyond the traditional notion of intelligence (which is typically equated to what IQ tests measure). <i>Civic Intelligence</i> is a type of intelligence that focuses on the betterment of society as a whole &#150; not just on individual aggrandizement. Moreover since <i>Civic Intelligence</i> focuses on <I>society as a whole,</I> its manifestation is collective and massively distributed. The boundary between one person\'s \"intelligence\" and another person\'s \"intelligence\" is permeable, indistinct, and constantly shifting. Ideas in your mind today might be central to my understanding of the world tomorrow. How \"intelligent\" would one person be without interacting with other people &#150; directly (through discussion or argument) or indirectly (through reading books, watching television or pondering works of art) &#150; or with the non-human world (observing nature, for example). \r\n\r\n<i>Civic Intelligence</i> builds on what we know about how people learn and maintain knowledge about the world and their place within it. Intelligent behavior in individuals is rich and multifaceted. It involves perception, monitoring, deliberating, remembering and forgetting, categorizing, coming up with new ideas and modifying old ones, negotiating and discussing, making decisions, testing hypotheses and experimenting. Society as a whole engages in analogous activities and these are embedded in our institutions, traditions, artifacts, and conversations. That they exist is indisputable. Less obvious, but also true, is the fact that they are all subject to change. The idea that they could &#150; and <i>should</i> &#150; be consciously improved is the topic of this pattern. \r\n\r\nThe number of organizations exhibiting civic intelligence today is incredibly vast and growing. There were ten times more \"transnational advocacy organizations\" in 2000 then there were in 1900 (Keck and Sikkink, 1998). Not only are these organizations more numerous but they are increasingly thoughtful and forward-looking. While in the past, protest may have been simply opposed to something, it is not uncommon today for organizations to develop sophisticated analyses and policy recommendations. In the first published exploration of civic intelligence (Schuler, 2001), six dimensions were identified (orientation, organization, engagement, intelligence, products and projects, and resources) in which organizations and movements that demonstrate civic intelligence are likely to differ from those that don\'t. Some notable examples (among tens of thousands) include the worldwide Indymedia network, the World Social Forum, the Global Fund for Women, Jubilee 2000, Science for the People, and New Tactics in Human Rights. \r\n\r\nA model (illustrated below and <a href=\"http://www.scn.org/commnet/Presentations/Slides/ci-model-2.html\">described in more detail</a> elsewhere) of civic intelligence that depicts its primary processes has been proposed (Schuler, 2001). It contains three main components: the \"environment\" which includes everything that is relevant to the organization, yet \"outside\" of the organization; (2) the \"mental model\" (or \"core\") that corresponds to the sum of knowledge that the organization uses; and (3) the remaining constituents of the organization including its resources (including people) and most importantly the interactive processes under the control of the organization that link the environment and the mental model. The functional model contains eight types of <i>interactive processes</i> that a movement, organization or other group exhibits when engaging in civic intelligence. <ol><li><i>Monitoring.</i> How the organization acquires new relevant information non-intrusively.</li><li><i>Discussion and deliberation.</i> How organizations discuss issues and determine common agendas, \"issue frames\" (Keck and Sikkink, 1998) and action plans with other organizations. The mental model of any participants or of the organization itself can change as a result of the interactions. </li><li><i>Engagement.</i> How the organization attempts to make changes through varying degrees of cooperation and combativeness.</li><li><i>Resource transfer.</i> How non-informational resources like volunteers and money are acquired from the environment.</li><li><i>Interpretation of new information.</i> How new information is considered and how it ultimately becomes (or doesn\'t become) part of the core. New information can also include information about the organization.</li><li><i>Maintenance of mental model (includes resource management).</i> How the organization maintains its organizational integrity by consciously and unconsciously resisting change over time.</li><li><i>Planning and plan execution.</i> How a campaign is initiated, carried out, and monitored.</li><li><i>Modification of mental model.</i> How the core itself is scrutinized by participants in the organization and modified. Another term for this is \"organizational learning.\"</li></ol> \r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of each of these processes will help determine the effectiveness of the entire organization.  For that reason, it\'s important to develop surveys and other types of diagnostic tools (instruments) that can help organizations effectively use the civic intelligence paradigm. This information could be key in evaluating actions or developing plans. Some of the other uses of this knowledge include inventorying civic intelligence initiatives of geographical regions and/or thematic activist areas, convening inter-organizational workshops, designing curricula, planning campaigns, or, even, developing new organizations. One of the most important uses of this information is metacognition; examining and evaluating how the processes are used within an organization &#150; and changing them as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe physical, social and intellectual environment is changing rapidly. Intelligence, more than anything else, describes the capacity to influence and to adapt to its environment. Organizations with civic missions have the responsibility to keep their principles intact while interacting effectively with other organizations, both aligned with and opposed to, their own beliefs and objectives.', 'An effective and principled civic intelligence is necessary to help humankind deal collectively with its collective challenges. People need to develop theories, models and tools of civic intelligence that can help integrate thought and action more effectively.', NULL, 1, 453, '2006-10-30 15:02:19', '2008-10-15 21:05:12', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(211, 201, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'One of the biggest problems in contemporary life is the unchecked growth of market values as a way to govern resources and ourselves. This is resulting in the privatization and commodification  or \"enclosure\"  of the commons.  Resources that morally or legally belong to everyone are increasingly coming under the control of markets.   \r\n\r\nNot only does enclosure result in higher prices and the need to ask for permission to use something previously available to all, it shifts ownership and control to private companies.  The market efficiencies that businesses seek can be illusory, however, because they often depend upon unacknowledged subsidies from the commons (for example, discount access to public resources) and the displacement of costs onto the commons (pollution, social disruption, harm to future generations).  Enclosure does not add value in the aggregate; it merely privatizes value at the expense of the common wealth.', '\"The commons\" is a useful term for contemporary political discourse because it provides a new lexicon for re-situating market activity in a social and political context.  It helps us identify resources that should not be alienated for market use, but should remain non-propertized and \"owned\" (in a civic or democratic sense) by everyone.  Our culture has no serious vocabulary for contextualizing \"the free market\" in a social framework; it assumes that it is a universal, ahistorical force of nature.  The commons helps rectify this conceptual problem by offering a rich, countervailing template to the market paradigm, one that can speak about the economic and legal aspects of a commons as intelligibly as its social and personal aspects.', 'The commons insists that certain things should not be alienated   that is, sold and converted into money. Thus, it is inappropriate to express the value of a worker\'s life or an endangered species as a dollar sum, in a cost-benefit analysis.  It may be morally repugnant to sell off the \"naming rights\" of public institutions much as it is considered unacceptable to allow people to sell their bodies, babies, ova or genes.\r\n\r\nThe commons gives us a language for talking about extra-market values and their importance.  The commons, for example, allows us to talk about the human necessities of life  food, water, fuel, medicine  that may otherwise be seen as market commodities alone. The commons allows us to talk about the need for open, non-propertized spaces available to all; if too much of that space  for example, scientific knowledge, musical works, cultural symbols  is \"locked up\" through copyrights, patents or contracts, it can greatly impede future creativity and progress. We are already seeing the effects of such enclosure in medical research as a result of overly broad patents on \"upstream\" research.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, when information and creativity are non-propertized and non-monetized  as we see most frequently on the Internet  the resulting collaborations and exchanges generate a huge surplus value that can be enjoyed by everyone, and not be privatized. This is one reason there is such an epic struggle underway on the Internet  non-market modes of creativity and production are frequently more efficient in a strict economic sense, compared to conventional \"real world\" markets. There is a cornucopia of the commons, not a tragedy, as economists otherwise claim.\r\n\r\nDespite the different ways in which commons and market create value, the two do not necessarily operate in separate and distinct spheres, but are interdependent.  The point is to strike an appropriate <i>balance</i> between the two so that the value-creating capacities of each can be optimized.\r\n\r\nThere are a wide variety of effective commons-management models that belie the tragedy of the commons metaphor invoked by Garrett Hardin in his famous 1968 essay.  While Hardin was talking about an open access regime in which no one owns or manages a shared resource, an actual commons has specific rules and social norms for preventing over-use, excluding outsiders, and managing the resource in long-term, sustainable ways.  \r\n\r\nIncreasingly, the Internet is the host for countless self-organized commons such as free and open source software, social networking communities, Wikipedia, Craigslist, and websites for sharing photos, videos and other creative works.  One useful tool in creating these commons are Creative Commons licenses, which enable ordinary people to freely share their creative works while retaining copyrights for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nThe public library and the land trust are familiar, highly effective types of commons.  More people are starting to realize that public spaces like parks, community gardens, farmers markets and festivals are also important to the economic and social health of a community.  There is a dawning awareness that commons-based infrastructure like wireless Internet access is a great way to use a public resource, the airwaves, to help people connect with each other.\r\n\r\nThere are many other types of legal and institutional solutions for managing the commons, although most are not mentally grouped with other legal or institutional models <i>as</i> commons solutions.  It is time for more people to see the kinship of these solutions and their holistic advantages over so-called free market.', 'Using \"the commons\" as a new discourse helps us re-frame the terms of discussion for many issues and declare our personal stake in protecting shared public resources. It helps draw new linkages among disparate market enclosures, and in this sense, helps fragmented public-interest constituencies develop a new, shared language. At the same time the discourse of the commons validates a number of specific governance models -- civic institutions, stakeholder trusts, legal mechanisms, social customs and norms -- that can help us protect and manage our common assets effectively.\r\n\r\nThe emerging commons sector wont replace corporations or markets, but it will complement and temper them. In so doing, it will provide benefits corporations cant supply: healthy ecosystems, economic security, stronger communities and a participatory culture. And it will curb the corporate invasion of realms that we hold dear  nature, our minds, our food and our democracy.', NULL, 313, 776, '2006-10-18 17:01:39', '2006-10-18 14:22:55', NULL, NULL, 'Author', NULL, 266, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(212, 202, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, '\"What is the good life?\" An answer to that question has so many variations today that the competition between answers can often paralyze the imaginations of people who want to implement positive social change. How can one break through the noise and violence of such competition and begin moving global society in a positive and deliberate direction?', 'People who hope for a better world feel the need for a shared vision of the \"good life,\" a vision that is flexible enough for innumerable individual circumstances but comprehensive enough to unite people in optimistic, deliberate, progressive social change. Ideally, this shared vision of the \"good life\" should promote and sustain conviviality and solidarity among people, as well as feelings of individual effectiveness, self-worth and purpose. A shared vision of the \"good life\" is never complete, but is always adapting; it should be \"in harmony with the human condition,\" which means that it encompasses suffering, loss and conflict as well as pleasures, reverence and common goals of improvement. An emergent framework for the modern \"good life\" is based on some form of humanism, particularly pragmatic or civic humanism, but with room for a spiritual dimension of the mind that does not seek domination over the minds of others. Finally, the environmental crises of the planet require a broad vision of a \"good life\" that can harmonize human aspirations with natural limits. And all of this needs to be an ongoing and open-ended \"conversation,\" best suited to small geographic groups, such as towns and neighborhoods, that can craft and then live an identity that reflects their vision of a \"good life.\"', 'Ever since people first began to understand the implications of the time-limits of the human life, there has been speculation on what constitutes the best use of this time, a human lifespan -- in other words, what is the \"good life?\" \r\n\r\nThroughout human history and even today, the answer to this question, for most people, is provided by God and by ritual. That is, the fundamental guide for how to live life is religion expressed through ritual, not only the formal rituals of religious practice but the small daily rituals of an existence permeated with conventions derived from religious guidance. For billions of people today, this is so ingrained in their psyches that doubt about what constitutes the \"good life\" is absent -- or else a personal secret. \r\n\r\nBut there is are many other meanings attached to the phrase \"the good life.\" Aristotle argued that the good life is the \"bios theoretikos,\" the contemplative life, in which the aristos, the \"best man,\" spends his life contemplating the order of the cosmos and his place in it. This was transformed by Christianity into the life of the cloister, in which monks and nuns were meant to spend their lives contemplating the wonder of God\'s work. But it was also embedded into the practice of philosophy in the Western tradition, both metaphysical and otherwise, so that there is still today a strong Aristotelian association between the \"good life\" and the life of the mind. \r\n\r\nIt was in Renassiance Italy that Western thinkers first ventured a potential break between the idea of the \"good life\" and religion, by suggesting that the best example of a good life was a man of \"virtu,\" or the earthly qualities of courage, deliberate action and command -- someone who would be remembered in history, rather than rewarded in heaven. Machiavelli derided Christianity as a belief of meekness and submission, while he advocated a robust republican humanism that celebrated worldly success and the ability to turn one\'s life into a kind of work of art, not unlike the famous works of art of his time. \r\n\r\nThe great break of modernity, the separation of modern thinking with that of the past, is the idea that the \"good life\" is a matter of individual choice -- \"the pursuit of happiness,\" as the U.S. Declaration of Independence puts it. English rationalists, Marxian communists and even conservative thinkers like Edmund Burke all shared this premise: the goal of life is happiness and self-fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThus it has been the explosion of interpretations of the path to happiness that has produced so many competing conceptions of the good life. For many people today, the phrase \"the good life\" conjures up fantasies of unlimited wealth, leisure and luxury. This has certainly been the interpretation of marketers in a consumerist economy like our own. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for large numbers of people, the \"good life\" means simplicity and even austerity, an escape from the stress and bustle of urban life, pure air and water, the conviviality of a small rural community and good health. This is a model promoted by a series of books written in the 1930s by Scott and Helen Nearing, who moved to a farm in Vermont in 1932 and then published \"The Good Life,\" a book about \"simple, frugal and purposeful living,\" which was followed by more books and national speaking tours. The Good Life Center, a modern example of the Nearings\' work, is still in operation in Harborside, Maine. Elements of this interpretation of the good life are now found in the \"Slow Food\" movement of southern Europe (and in some groups in the U.S.), and its spin-off in Italy, the Slow Cities (Slow Cittá) movement. This trend has even acquired a label: \"downshifting.\"\r\n\r\nThe challenge of the current situation in the modern world is to develop the vision of a \"good life\" that is not anti-technological nor anti-spiritual, but which is serious about the limits of the global enviroment and critical of the emptiness, anomie and hectic \"busy-ness\" of consumerism. But cities are not going away -- they\'re growing, around the world -- so we need models of the \"good life\" that embrace urban living; indeed, population density is likely to be a necessity in the future. \r\n\r\nThere is an emerging concept of what might be called \"reverent humanism,\" borrowing terms from philosophers Paul Woodruff (Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue) and Luc Ferry (What Is the Good Life?). This proposes a blend of rational and practical humanism with an appreciation of the transcendent, whether it be beauty, the law, or the ineffable spirit of human perseverance. Such a worldview depends on the support of a social context, a community of equals engaged in open-ended dialog that rejects absolute knowledge -- a modernized version of the res publica, the ideal of the Italian Renaissance. The inspiring ideas of the \"Slow Food\" movement bring in the pleasures of good food, drink, conviviality and ecological balance, while globalization and communications technologies -- especially the Internet -- make possible a sharing of innovations and the development of an appreciation for diversity and peace.', 'A revitalization of the idea of the \"good life\" should reinvigorate the ancient appeal of civic humanism, or \"reverent humanism,\" that can embrace human potential, limits to consumerism but yet technological innovation, diversity and transcendence. The development of such an ideal should be a project -- explicit or implicit -- among groups dedicated to progressive social change. And \"living the change you want\" should become an essential part of the mission of all such groups.', NULL, 773, 451, '2006-10-18 17:00:49', '2006-10-18 14:33:09', NULL, NULL, 'University of Texas at Austin', NULL, 355, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(213, 203, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Social dominance is arguably at the heart of many &mdash; if not most &mdash; of humankind\'s most shameful enterprises. It is embodied in ideology, economics, policy, education, the media, social perception and interactions, culture, and, even, our technological artifacts. In general the less-dominant group will have fewer opportunities for advancement, have poorer health and shorter life-spans, smaller incomes, higher likelihood of being incarcerated and live under more violent conditions than people do in more-dominant groups. Society as a whole too suffers from high level of inequality: the more equal the distribution of assets, the more economic growth the society will have (Dugan, 2004; World Bank, 2004). Political violence is also tied to social inequality (Gurr, 1971). At its most extreme, social dominance encourages oppression and wars, genocide, mob violence, and environmental destruction.', 'This pattern pertains to any society, region, or organization where social dominance is entrenched; in other words, virtually everywhere.', 'As humans evolved our species unwittingly took on characteristics that have persisted for centuries. Over the millennia, some aspects of our genetic makeup, as well as some psychological and cultural characteristics were encouraged while others were halted or slowed. As we all know, these basic changes generally came about hundreds of thousands of years ago when humans lived in small numbers and clung together in small bands for survival. That situation, once the norm, is now present only in the rarest of circumstances. We have been bred for a time and place that existed eons, an era that could only be recreated through pandemics, global war, massive climate change, or some combination.\r\n\r\nOne consequence of this is the myriad institutional structures that perpetuate dominance of one group over others. The authors of a recent book on social dominance (Sidaneous and Pratto, 1999) make the case that our social psychology seems to propel us <i>naturally</i> towards oppression.  Unfortunately at least for those of us who believe that racism and other insidious \"isms\" would make excellent candidates for the dustbins of history, there are several factors that help keep social dominance in vogue. The first is that there does seem to be a measurable propensity (\"generalized ethnocentrism\") that shows up in some percentage of any population for strong group identification; people in this group believe that their group is superior to others and that they must stick together. When in positions of power they generally promote laws and attitudes that favor their group over others. They will also encourage and cleave to a variety of \"legitimizing myths,\" such as social Darwinism (\"survival of the fittest\"), manifest destiny, \"clash of civilization\" (Huntington, 1993) and a myriad of racial, gender, and ethnic stereotypes, as \"social frames\" that help perpetuate social dominance. The second is that racial (and other) stereotypes are easily and readily (and subconsciously) learned, generally at an early age before advanced cognitive abilities come into play that could question the accuracy and the value of the stereotypes.  Third, the stereotyping \"trigger\" is effortlessly and (again) subconsciously activated when \"appropriate,\" thus making these people the hapless targets of manipulative politicians and others who can specifically reach out to these people with tailored messages. Finally, unfortunately, there is some evidence that people in dominated groups, due to a combination of factors, will in many cases, adopt characteristics that are specified by the stereotype thus helping unconsciously to reinforce the stereotype (\"behavioral asymmetry\"). All of these factors, then, help support, at least indirectly, the maintenance of institutions that operate under a variety of processes, mechanisms, and biases that serve to maintain the machinery of social dominance.\r\n\r\nOnce the holistic model that Sidaneous and Pratto propose (possibly with modifications) is well understood, it should be possible to run society\'s social domination machines \"in reverse.\" Along these lines, it\'s important to note that according to many people who study this field, approaches to attenuating social dominance will require widespread, multi-sectoral actions that include integrated legislative, economic, and educational efforts among (and across) dominant and non-dominant groups.  Here is a list of approaches that can be undertaken &mdash; keeping in mind that <i>articulation</i> between these approaches will be critical if any a junction of social dominance is to be sustained over time. <ul><li>Role-reversal exercises (examples include \"Walk a Mile in their shoes\" where state legislators became welfare recipients for a day and an event in Wisconsin where youths in disadvantaged neighborhoods interrogated judges and police officers in a mock courtroom situation.</li><li>Additional research.  Identify, for example, \"markers or other classification schemes that sort people into two groups and see how the \"markers\" are used implicitly or explicitly in policy, the media, etc. etc. </li><li>Development and promulgation of social frames like \"love thy neighbor, turn the other cheek, human family, equal opportunity, and multiculturalism help characterize the theme. </li><li>Fighting local discrimination in, for example, education or public service.) </li><li>Moving beyond tokenism. There is evidence that hiring one or two people from a less-dominant group can actually backfire. </li><li>Childhood education. Children need multicultural education  and familiarity with different cultures and groups. Seeing a diverse society at an early age and not growing up with active stereotyping is good. </li><li>Lawsuits as a tool to fight social dominance by business and government. </li><li> Disciplining the media by fighting stereotypes solidarity networks. Establishing networks of people from diverse communities to inform each other, advocate and Religious connection. Remind people of their religions commitment to human rights and brotherhood and would with in the church for social change.</li></ul>According to Sidaneous and Pratto, \"Arbitrary-set divisions\" (those divisions devised by cultures themselves according to their own decisions like caste, religion, and race, unlike divisions shared by all cultures, basically gender and age, upon which to discriminate) \"largely only occur in societies in which people are able to generate and sustain an economic surplus.\" These societies employ division of labor that, apparently, leads to various forms of arbitrary-set based social dominance techniques and institutions. One of the most difficult challenges of such a society is checking the power of its most powerful members. \r\n \r\nWhile many people would argue (myself included) that some degree of social dominance will probably always occur in society, there are also many people (myself included) who believe that a meaningful attenuation in social dominance is not only possible but necessary. Fighting against social dominance will always be an uphill battle: the forces that will rally against your campaign are, by definition, powerful and well-financed, and cozy with the media, government, and other elites. They will also have a ready supply of slogans handy to bring their minions into the fray.     Sometimes trumping our own \"intrinsic nature\" to favor \"our own, \' and, even, going against what may seem like \"our own best interest\" (maximizing short-term gain at another\'s expense) is the best long-range approach. And approaches that are actually win-win should be accompanied with public education that pre-empts the inevitable claim that the approach is discriminatory. \r\n\r\nAlthough social dominance may be intrinsic to humankind, there are some grounds for hope. Some countries, Sweden, for example, have more-or-less eliminated social dominance based on gender. Studies relating to health care in Japan, New Zealand, Denmark and Sweden, also show that proper health care can be reached for all of a nation\'s citizens even if some social inequality still exists within that society.', 'Serious, ongoing and engaged commitment to social non-dominance is the core to \"solving\" the problems of social dominance. A society that genuinely wants to reduce its own inequity is obviously more likely to actually adopt new policies and perspectives over the long haul than one who begrudges every dime spend on schools for poor people or health care for the elderly and the foreign-born. Understanding how the machines of social dominance function provides important clues for the development of a counter machine.', NULL, 820, 870, '2006-12-11 10:08:06', '2007-03-11 10:08:44', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Over one billion people have no access to clean water. and half the people in the world live on under $2 (US) per day. The worsening conditions of the world\'s impoverished people provide almost ideal conditions for the cultivation of disease, including those that could reach epidemic or pandemic proportions. In addition, a somewhat invisible epidemic of depression and other mental illnesses are taking a heavy toll on people throughout the developing world.', 'The economic divisions between people have become astronomical &mdash; and they are still widening. Within this context, the majority of people are literally living from one day to the next. Understandably, the health of these people is severely compromised. People everywhere and in all walks of life have cause for alarm.', 'Environmental changes are adding additional strains to the already imperiled lives of the world\'s poorest people. \"Droughts will worsen. We will see deforestation, forest fires, a loss of diversity, and degradation of the environment\" according to Michel Jarraud, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization\" (Stevenson, 2006). Not surprisingly, the poorest &mdash; and hence most vulnerable &mdash; people are often the first victims of the severely declining standards of health in much of the developing world. As Paul Epstein of Harvard Medical School said, \"Today climate instability and the exhaustion of resources (forests, soils, water, biodiversity), together with the growing inequity and deepening poverty, are resulting in the emergence, resurgence and redistribution of infectious disease, stalking humans, plants and animals. The conditions are not sustainable, and the mounting social and economic costs are creating convergent agendas among members of civil society, international institutions and the economic sector.\" \r\n\r\nWhy are things different today? For one thing the sheer number of people on the planet seems to be approaching the limits to the world\'s capacities. Unfortunately the trends are all heading in the wrong direction. Furthermore people everywhere are more tightly connected. It is no longer true that we live in isolated communities. The tight connections, although remote, give rise to \"causes\" (although diffuse and multiple) that are often far away from the person who ultimately falls ill.  \r\n\r\nClearly humankind has a moral obligation to establish health as a human right. That is a reasonable <i>first</i> step. More importantly, humankind has the obligation to act forcefully and diligently as if it actually believed that health was an inalienable human right. However, as Garrett and Rosenstein report, global health as an issue is \"not only for do-gooders.\" They go on to say that, \"A self-interest component to the global health debate has clearly emerged &mdash; thankfully, because purely altruistic efforts often fall short of international support and sustainability. The interconnected nature of the world makes ignorance of issues such as deadly infectious diseases not only immoral, but self-destructive.\"\r\n\r\nHealth must not, however, be viewed solely as providing medical care after disaster or disease strikes. While it\'s true that a pill or injection can save a life, the person whose life has just been saved will soon find him or herself back in an environment that leads inexorably to poor health, compromised ability to work gainfully, and a diminished life-span. Nor is health something that can be attained solely through research. A focus on \"the cure\" for this disease or that disease is a typically a type of welfare program for western researchers. It\'s a search for a magic\" silver bullet\" or technocratic approach that, while often very important, will be only effective in conjunction with other approaches. \r\n\r\nExtreme and persistent poverty is the primary cause of ill-health and premature death around the world. If people weren\'t in desperate poverty, if they earned an adequate living, the incidence of disease would plummet. Especially today health is linked to poverty. This poverty is not confined to individuals, but covers large sections of the world\'s rural areas, towns and cities and, indeed, entire countries. If, for example, a person enters the hospital in many parts of the world he or she is likely to find infection, unsanitary conditions and a scarcity of drugs, bandages, surgical equipment and other vital medical supplies.\r\n\r\nPaul Farmer is one the most articulate and hardest-hitting advocate for health care for all of the world\'s inhabitants, especially those who are the poorest and most vulnerable. He identifies <em>structural inequalities</em> that often originate in the first world as sources of great of the misery that now exists in the third. The \"roots\" of the problem are likely to lead further upstream than exposure to a microbe in polluted water to a bank in London, an energy company in Houston, or a government office in Washington, D.C. As part of his work and study, Farmer traveled to prisons in the former Soviet Union and to Chiapas, Haiti, and other marginalized locations around the world to work with people in need of medical care and to witness firsthand how health conditions were being met &mdash; or not met &mdash; around the world. In his book, <em>Pathologies of Power</em> (2003), he proposes a \"new agenda\" for health and human rights\" that includes the following five facets:\r\n\r\n&#149; Make Health and Healing the Symbolic Core of the Agenda\r\n&#149; Make Provision of Services Central to the Agenda\r\n&#149; Establish New Research Agendas\r\n&#149; Achieve Independence from Powerful Governments and Bureaucracies\r\n&#149; Secure More Resources for Health and Human Rights\r\n\r\nFarmer\'s \"new agenda\" is comprehensive, holistic and ambitious. At the same time, it seems that anything less would be insufficient. NGOs and philanthropists, no matter how well-heeled, will not be able to do this work by themselves. The multi-pronged approach resembles the Open Research and Action Network pattern &mdash; but writ very large. He is not unrealistic about the chances for success. He lists a number of significant challenges to this agenda including the possibility that increasing the involvement of NGOs will help hasten, \"the withdrawal of states from the basic business of providing housing, education, and medical resources usually means further erosion of the social and economic rights of the poor.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"new agenda\" would take a mammoth effort that would integrate direct care, research, and popular mobilization. Ultimately Farmer\'s recommendations could provide an umbrella for many types of efforts. Health care professionals could take Sabbaticals in developing countries to assist with health care. Religious people could put renewed vigor into projects to alleviate human suffering. The 400+ billionaires in the US (and everybody) could follow the lead of Bill Gates and others and donate substantial amounts of their amassed riches to the effort. At the same time, the rest of us could agitate for health-related initiatives including cheaper drugs from multi-national pharmacuetical companies and authentic foreign aid that wasn\'t based on arms or oil. \r\n\r\nGarrett and Rosenstein (2005) point out that, \"with very few exceptions, the disease amplifiers in the world today are manmade and therefore humanly controllable. ... exotic animal markets, unclean urban water supplies, lack of proper sewage systems, and unstable, conflict-ridded environments provide excellent breeding grounds for infectious diseases to spread and wreak havoc on vulnerable populations. Yet it would be short sided to think of infectious disease as a problem for solely the poor and powerless. These diseases do not discriminate; they are undeterred by state borders, party affiliation, or socioeconomic status. With air travel and human migration on the rise, so too is the possibility that deadly microbes can and will circumnavigate the globe with speed and precision.\"', 'Humankind is faced with the massive problem of declining public health. To be successful it will need to redirect its resources from activities that exacerbate the crisis to ones that overcome it. Ideologies, however dear, as well as ingrained habits and pursuit of short-term \"self-interest\" are likely to defeat any grand initiatives such as this.

This understanding can also be used to deny the reality or meaning of oppression and suffering in other countries and to eschew responsibility from helping to redress these problems. Citizenship also determines access to health care, education, and other rights &mdash; rights that arguably should be universal. A narrow interpretation of citizenship implicitly cedes power to national governments whose defense of \"national interest\" can sometimes be used against its own citizens who have no legal access to a \"higher authority,\" and can restrict the participation of citizens in global affairs and problem-solving.', 'In the waning years of the 20th century, people worldwide began to increasingly notice the world <i>outside their own.</i> At the same time nation-states, facing the new realities of economic globalization, seemed to be losing their ability &mdash; as well as their interest &mdash; in promoting the welfare of their own citizens and the natural world. As stated by John Urry: \"More generally, global money markets, world travel, the Internet, globally recognized brands, globally organized corporations, the Rio Earth summit, \'global celebrities\' living as global citizens and so on, all speak of modes of social experience which transcend each nation-state and its constitution of the national citizen\" (1999). We could also add global climate change, natural resource depletion, economic inequity and other vast problems that humankind now faces.', 'Citizenship is generally described as the formal relationship, usually codified in law, of a person (the citizen) and a state and often is delineated in terms of <i>rights</i> and <i>responsibilities.</i> Its site has shifted from the Greek city-state where the idea first took hold to the modern nation-state whose birth is linked to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia that established the convention that countries and its citizens do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.\r\n\r\nMany nationalist political movements &mdash; the 18th century American Revolution through the 20th century Palestinian Liberation struggle &mdash; emphasized national identity and citizenship to assert their right to self-determination and political autonomy from oppressive colonial states. But history is also rife with examples of nationalism used to oppress and remove minority, and sometimes majority, populations. At the same time, the liberal concept of citizenship based on a shared national identity offers the promise of overcoming religious and ethnic divisions. From the perspective of economically disadvantaged and oppressed sub-populations, however, the promise of inclusively and shared interests has fallen flat. \r\n\r\nThe transnational realm of global capital in a \"free market\" world, requires global civic response. As national laws are superceded by international treaties and trade agreements, individuals rights and obligations become governed by global institutions&mdash;the reality that citizens of debt-ridden nations are well aware of. The question is not whether or not we are global citizens. The question is what form will our citizenship take. What are our rights and responsibilities toward global governing institutions and structures. Should governing bodies be directly elected by the governed? How will the rights of the weakest be protected from the strongest in the global polity? What counts as a right? What responsibilities do global citizens have to one another? \r\n\r\nWe need to ask what types of globalization are empowering to individuals and define and construct ones are likely to lead to collective problem solving. Currently there are few opportunities for people to help address shared problems. Unfortunately, this lack of opportunity comes at time when many of the problems facing humankind are global problems that require global thinking and acting. In addition to preventing people from contributing to the general welfare, narrow versions of citizenship are used to establish arbitrary categories of deservedness. Our narrow version of citizenship makes it less likely that global solutions &mdash; that work for everybody &mdash; are developed. The opposite, in fact, is more likely &mdash; that collective dilemmas are \"resolved\" in ways that are relatively bad for everybody &mdash; or nearly everybody. \r\n\r\nThere are two useful avenues for people to explore if we are to make headway towards realizing this pattern. The first is to assume the role and responsibilities without seeking permission from an authoritative source; obtaining permission would of course be impossible given that no authoritative source exists who can bestow such a designation. Assuming this role means thinking &mdash; and acting &mdash; globally; adopting the perspective that the world is densely interconnected, its general health is important and well-intentioned and well-informed citizens can play a positive role. The second is to actively work towards some formal recognition of global citizenship by, for example, helping to define and develop the intellectual and administrative scaffolding does not currently exist. Both of these paths could be undertaken individually or through working with existing or new organizations that work in these areas. \r\n\r\nWhen Diogenes, the Greek philosopher, stated that he was a citizen of the world, he was refusing, according to Martha Nussbaum, \"to be defined simply by his local origins and group memberships, associations central to the self-image of a conventional Greek male; he insisted on defining himself in terms of more universal aspirations and concerns\" (Nussbaum, 2003). But to some scholars, the nation-state is the rightful and permanent well-spring of citizenship. Michael Walzer, for example, finds it difficult to contemplate the idea since, \"No one has ever offered me [world] citizenshipor provided me with a list of the benefits and obligations of citizenship or shown me  the common celebrations and commemorations of its citizens. Walzer provided a useful laundry list of practical objectives that proponents of global citizenship would need to consider. \r\n\r\nAnn Florini (2005) builds a case that the Internet may help create a global consciousness that is analogous to the nationalist consciousness that the printed word helped inspire. The printing press led to a reconciliation of regional differences and a cheaper and faster way to reach constituencies that were too remote for effective collaboration. This then played a strong role in the development of the nation-state and, hence, nation-state-based citizenship. In similar fashion, Florini surmises that a new global consciousness could help usher in broader, more inclusive notions of citizenship. And although these are more likely to be dynamic, idiosyncratic and short-lived, new web sites are springing into existence every day. The Internet makes it easier to learn about \"foreign\" perspectives, that while they can be as hidebound as their \"domestic\" counterparts, they help reveal the immense diversity of viewpoints on earth as well as the universality of concerns facing people everywhere. \r\n\r\nAre there examples of de facto global citizenship? Organizations like \"No person is illegal\" and the Reporters / Doctors / etc. \"Without Borders\" groups are getting closer to that ideal. Are there practical experiments that could be done now &mdash; The growth of \"universal declarations,\" supporting human rights, for example, helps explain why the time might be fairly ripe for thinking like this. \r\n\r\nThe concept of global citizenship currently lacks the administrative and legalistic trappings of national citizenship. Nevertheless from Diogenes to the present day, the pursuit and adoption of \"global citizenship\", however demeaned and under-institutionalized it is at present, continues to provide an compelling vision to millions of people around the world, people who are officially noted as \"belonging\" to individual, specific countries. The bottom line, however, for everybody interested in these issues, is that people must think <i>beyond the borders</i> of the countries in which they hold citizenship. \r\n\r\nAs with other patterns in this category, the journey towards the goal will be incremental, perennial, lurching, and met by setbacks as well as successes. There are tasks for many people with a wide variety of roles and responsibilities; professionals like lawyers, think-tank and NGO staff, government officials and academics can engage with the public on these issues in addition to their more specialized and technical concerns. There are hosts of organizations and projects in which people can engage. Communication with people in other countries is especially important because this helps ensure they are recognized as real people and not abstract non-persons. This, of course, represents a major hurdle as many people because of poverty, language barriers or other reasons cannot easily engage with people outside of their region.', 'Martha Nussbaum, in her 1994 discussion on the Stoics in \"Patriotism and Cosmopolitanism\" refers to the fact that each of us dwells, in effect, in two communities  the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration that \"is truly great and truly common, in which we look neither to this corner nor to that, but measure the boundaries of our nation by the sun\" (Seneca, De Otio).', NULL, 864, 760, '2006-11-20 13:27:52', '2006-11-20 00:00:36', 'The Evergreen State College', NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

What  political settings', 'Political settings are the basic physical units of collective political action. Each instance of a political setting has its own unique location in space and time. Many recur on a regular basis. Meetings and demonstrations are common types of political setting. Here are two recent examples from reports about political change in Venezuela. One is a small-scale political setting, a barrio meeting; the other describes two large-scale, competing political marches:\r\n\r\nThe Meeting\r\nNidia Lopez stood on one side of the brick built shack. It was like one of the thousands that made up the barrio of Andres Bello. The barrios, or slums, are where the majority of the Venezuelan population lives. Thirty people looked at Nidia. Some of them stood outside in the mud. The building was too small to fit them all.\r\n	Nidia spoke and her voice was clear and loud. She said, \"There are 23 families living on the street in this barrio. In eight years what has this government done for them? In three years what has this Committee done for them? They need help now! What are we going to do for them now?\"\r\n	The \"we\" that Nidia was talking about was the Urban Land Committee for the Andres Bello barrio. The Urban Land Committees...exist everywhere there are barrios in Venezuela and barrios are everywhere in Venezuela.\r\n	When barrio problems are discussed...the most common suggestion is to get organized. At the Andres Bello meeting, barrio resident Hector Madera said, When the people of our barrio have a problem they mustnt rely on the media, or go and whisper in the ear of a friend in a Chavista party, we need to organize ourselves.\r\n	Nidia Lopez felt the best way the Andres Bello CTU could help the 23 homeless families was to take the appeal to the President. Everybody else in the meeting argued it was more important that organization happen first.\r\n	The families should...discuss with each other about what they wanted. They should also talk with the owner of the mansion. Only then should they approach the government for assistance if they still needed it.\r\n	Madera said the barrios needed to organize together, \"When organized we can involve the people from nearby barrios, like Chapellin, and get their support. We will help them and them us. Together we solve our problems ourselves. We can march together.\"\r\n	( Source: Entitled to Democracy:Venezuelas Urban Land Committees and Participatory Democracy.

One in support of the Chavez-led \"Bolivarian Revolution,\" and the other with the opposition. This marks the sixth year in a row that Venezuelan workers have held separate marches on May 1st.\r\n	The opposition march was led by the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV) which, according to the Venezuelan daily El Universal, called for the participants to march for increased salaries, back-pay, a dignified social security system, and freedom for CTV President Carlos Ortega, who was sentenced last year to 16 years in prison for his role in the two-month 2002-3 oil industry shut down.\r\n	\"Things are turbulent. With this government everything is turbulent,\" yelled 15 year- CTV veteran, Israel Masa, from the opposition march. \"Thats why we are marching -- to demand transparency in the next elections, because we in the opposition know that we are the majority and that we are the true democrats.\"\r\n	The pro-government march was led by the National Workers Union (UNT) and officially entitled, the \"Bolivarian March Against Imperialism and Free Trade Agreements,\" highlighting the international importance of todays celebrations, and calling attention to the recent motives for Venezuelas withdrawal from the Community of Andean Nations.\r\n	\"This demonstration is a struggle against imperialism and the conspiratorial plans of US imperialism against Venezuela,\" announced Venezuelan National Assembly Representative Dario Vivas ...at the start of the march. \"The people of Venezuela are ready to do whatever necessary to guarantee our liberty.\"\r\n	(Source: Opposition and Chavez Supporters March Separately for Mayday in Venezuela, Tuesday, May 02, 2006. By Michael Fox - Venezuelanalysis.com) \r\n\r\nAs these two examples show, the respective contexts -- social structure, rules of entry and action, physical layout, and cultural expectations -- heavily influence the quality of participation and the content of decisions and messages. Political setting is a particularly useful concept for describing political action in context, the venues of face-to-face political communication that are the building-blocks of public political life. They encompass all occasions in which issues and needs of general importance to a community or a society are discussed, contested, and decided. They may be open and democratic, but very often they explicitly or implicitly bar certain groups, certain perspectives, and certain issues. It is important to investigate how they filter participants and ideas.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of meetings and debates that seek to influence community-wide matters take place in government institutions, an increasing proportion occur in voluntary associations, social movement groupings, and invitation-only meetings.  Internet discussions demonstrate the growing importance of virtual political settings and raise questions about how they differ from face-to-face meetings and how uneven access to computers affects political outcomes. The rules and culture of each setting influence the quality of communication, deliberation, and decision-making it embodies. Are they open or secret? Which voices do they amplify or exclude? What about women, poor people, people of low status, different cultures and religions?  What is their impact?\r\n\r\nThe idea of political setting draws upon ecological psychologys concept of \"behavior settings,\" but it puts the focus on activity that aims to influence public policy.  It opens the door into exploration of the evolving pattern language exemplified in the face-to-face political actions from below that are emerging in meetings and demonstrations around the world with all their limitations as well as their strengths.', 'Seeing and analyzing popular politics through the lens of political settings promises to generate a useful and realistic view of the political resources available for popular action and of the obstacles that such action faces.', NULL, 637, 875, '2006-10-18 21:41:43', '2006-10-30 09:35:51', NULL, NULL, 'University of Toronto', NULL, 312, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Where social benefits form all or part of an organization&#8217;s purpose, this alone does not guarantee positive achievements. Any organization with a shared vision of social responsibility, whether a for-profit corporation or a not-for-profit group working for the public good, needs to deliver what it promises. A passion for principles drives the efforts of individuals and citizen groups to make corporations, professions and governments more responsive; the more open and accountable they are, the more responsive they will become.', 'The striving for social responsibility takes many forms. Grameen Bank (www.grameen-info.org) and its founder, Muhammad Yunus, received the 2006 Nobel Prize for furthering peace and human rights by providing economic opportunities that conventional banks would not. Working Assets (www.workingassets.com) preassigns a portion of its revenues to activist causes. Socially responsible investing uses published criteria to recommend investment vehicles and to initiate stockholder actions in support of particular principles. \r\n\r\nAdvocacy organizations pursue a wide variety of principles. The Saltwater Institute advocates five values: (a) family and community responsibility, (b) respect and appreciation for the natural world, (c) service and stewardship, (d) the necessity for work and productivity, and (e) an intentional commitment to goodness (www.saltwater.org/our_story/beliefs.htm). Scientists for Global Responsibility (www.sgr.org.uk) opt for openness, accountability, peace, social justice and environmental sustainability, while Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (www.cpsr.org) address technological problems in the light of technology-related principles.\r\n\r\nUntil the late 19th century, corporate charters in the United States confined a company to a specific purpose in the common good. For example, an 1823 act of the New York legislature incorporated the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company with a charter to build and maintain, with private investment, a canal between the Delaware and Hudson rivers and to charge regulated fees for the transport of coal and other goods. Any other activity by the corporation, such as setting up a bank, required an amendment to its charter (Whitford, 1905). A recent form of the socially-responsible corporate charter is the Community Interest Company ( www.cicregulator.gov.uk).\r\n\r\nIn 1970, the economist Milton Friedman wrote that \"The social responsibility of business is to maximize its profits.\" Invoking the authority of Adam Smith to claim that society most benefits if everyone pursues selfish advantage, Friedman paved the way for some businesses to ignore the wider impacts of their pursuit of low costs, increasing sales, and big financial returns, and to consider themselves accountable only to owners and regulators. In turn, this gave rise to the tyranny of the financial bottom line; any attempt at purposeful social progress needs to overcome the myth that social progress takes place of its own accord.\r\n\r\nActivism on behalf of principles other than self-interest or convenience is necessary to remind selfish businesses of their social responsibility, and to prevent other organizations from losing touch with theirs. This activism can take place outside the organization, in citizen groups and political platforms, or within the organization as the individual actions of the tempered radical (Meyerson, 1995) and in the form of changes to policy and governance. In these efforts, the struggle of advocacy is at least as important as the specific principles being advocated. Social responsibility does not depend upon any one principle of conduct.\r\n\r\nTo be socially responsible is to be accountable to a full range of interested parties for the achievement of clearly-stated goals. It calls for: (a) clear vision, values and strategy for a better future; (b) understanding and management of expectations; (c) actions compatible with vision and values; (d) monitoring of outcomes; (e) accountability for results; and (f) a culture and governance that makes this possible. A socially responsible organization acts on the basis of clear values, which may explicitly include measurable results, transparency and accountability (e.g. www.gfusa.org/about_us/values).\r\n\r\nAny organization has internal and external stakeholders: customers and constituencies which both contribute to and benefit from the organization\'s work. For example, the Citizens Advice Bureau (2004) considers stakeholders to include potential and actual clients, volunteers, staff, partners, policy makers, and government bodies. No two of these customers of constituencies have the same expectations. A socially responsible organization makes itself accountable to stakeholders according to the unique expectations of each group, and always consistently with its values and strategy.\r\n\r\nAccountability to stakeholders measures actual performance against predetermined goals. It does not simply describe what an organization has achieved in the past, but requires commitment to achievements in advance. To be accountable is to measure indicators of performance that affect stakeholders, and to make the results transparent&#8212;that is, to report outcomes to stakeholders as evidence that the organization is fulfilling its goals and enacting its values. One example is a set of performance indicators for microfinance institutions ( www.swwb.org/English/2000/performance_standards_in_microfinance.htm).\r\n\r\nAny organization devoted to serving others is measured every time someone walks in or logs on&#8212;indeed, whenever anyone even drives past the building or happens upon the web site. A commitment to achieve social benefits does not absolve a not-for-profit from thinking of the people it serves as customers, and to consider its relations with them as marketing (Brinckerhoff, 2003). To clearly understand perspectives from outside the organization is a first step toward measuring and improving the organization\'s impact.\r\n\r\nSocial responsibility requires accountability, but for what and to whom? Several frameworks exist for measures of accountability. The Balanced Scorecard (Kaplan & Norton, 1992) suggests four linked categories: financial, customer, internal business, and innovation and learning. These categories are linked to strategy because improvement in any one will benefit all the others (except that no direct relationship is claimed between the first and the last). Epstein and Birchard (1999) propose three categories: financial, operational, and social.\r\n\r\nA \"stakeholder scorecard\" (Epstein & Birchard, 1999, p. 96) uses the major stakeholders as categories of performance measures. This approach directly measures how the organization serves its stakeholders, and orients strategy towards those with an interest in the outcomes. Stakeholders may fall into predetermined categories, such as shareholders, customers, employees and communities (Epstein & Birchard, 1999); alternatively, they may simply appear as a list of specific categories of stakeholder most important to the organization.\r\n\r\nNo organization, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, is socially responsible simply by virtue of its intent to achieve social benefits. Action consistent with the organization\'s espoused values demands a culture&#8212;ethical assumptions, values, beliefs and behaviors&#8212;that pervades the organization from top to bottom. Without a culture of demonstrable consistency between espoused and practiced values, claims to social responsibility are at best window-dressing, and at worst a symptom of a demoralized, failing and unethical organization. By contrast, a culture of accountability makes an organization more effective and more sustainable; social responsibility demands nothing less.', 'Whether from without or within, advocate for principles to help for-profit corporations realize their social responsibility in addition to the responsibility they feel toward stockholders, and to spur not-for-profit organizations, government bodies, and professions to keep their social responsibility in view.

(218, 208, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Because almost all contemporary societies are androcentric (male-centered), womens needs, interests, ideas, and perspectives on the world are often ignored or trivialized. Androcentrism perpetuates a patriarchal system that oppresses women and severely constrains (and damages) mens lives as well.  An orientation toward social change that gives voice to womens perspectives and strives to replace patriarchy with an egalitarian, matrifocal society would go a long way toward creating a just and peaceful world for all.', 'Although societies differ in the degree and form which male dominance takes, male privilege is generally maintained through systems of beliefs, laws, discriminatory practices, and cultural norms (including direct or indirect perpetuation of male violence). Patriarchy concentrates social, political, and economic power in the hands of men at the expense of women. Because gender oppression is ancient and insidious, a conscious effort is needed to recognize the gendered dimensions of social problems. Looking at the world with a matrifocal orientation can help create contexts in which women-centered analyses of social problems are fully incorporated into problem-solving processes.', 'A matrifocal orientation to social change draws directly on womens experience and knowledge and puts the needs of oppressed women at the center of social transformation.  Matrifocal societies, real and imagined, do not challenge patriarchy by offering its mirror image--with women in positions of dominance over men.  Rather, they embrace values traditionally seen as feminine: peace, nurturance, cooperation, and care for those most in need. A matrifocal society is one in which dominance over others is not supported (neither as an individual or collective goal).  The needs and contributions of women are valued equally with those of men. Womens interests are not special interests but human interests.  Social distinctions between males and females may be minimized [depending on the culture], and those biological/social differences that remain do not inhibit womens full participation in the society.   A matrifocal orientation to social change recognizes that the rising of the women means the rising of the [human] race (1).  \r\n\r\nThe need for womens voices to be heard in order for society to become more just, has been recognized by progressive social reformers for centuries (and probably longer).  This awareness led to the development of women-centered movements throughout the world.  As a social/political orientation, the Matrifocus pattern is reflected in both feminist organizing in first world nations and community-centered womens organizing in Third world nations.  Historically, many Third World womens organizations have been concerned with conditions of economic hardship, displacement, and state-sponsored violence affecting their communities as a whole, while first world feminist groups have focused more exclusively on womens social and political rights.  In recent decades the issue of violence against women has been a common theme of transnational women organizing (2).  Regardless of the issue, whenever women organize with the goal of creating a more just and sustainable society, they are endeavoring to insert their voices and their perspectives into the public debate. By doing so, they are subverting the androcentric norm of male power and female silence.\r\n\r\nLas Madres de Plaza de Mayo, for example, were able to subvert androcentric norms after initially making use of them. The simultaneous cultural respect for motherhood and perceived political irrelevance of women, allowed Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo to protest relatively unhindered at a time when public demonstrations were officially illegal in Argentina. By also making themselves visible beyond national borders, Las Madres fostered a successful international advocacy network to pressured government investigation into state sponsored murders during the Pinochet regime.  The powerful example of Argentinean mothers refusing to be silent has inspired other womens groups, such as Women in Black in Israel and elsewhere, to stand out publicly against state sponsored violence. \r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, many organizations that can be described as having a matrifocal orientation have been womens organizations.  But this is not required by the pattern.  Labor groups reflect a matrifocal orientation when they strive for gender equity policies, family leave policies, the right to organize in traditionally female occupations, and increased female union leadership. Anti-globalization groups demonstrate a matrifocal orientation when they recognize the significant impact of trade policies on women, and when they give voice to womens knowledge as farmers, workers, parents, and preservers of culture. Environmental groups like the Chipko movement in India or EcoFeminists in the U.S. reflect a matrifocal orientation when they draw upon and amplify the voices of women, highlight reproductive issues as environmental issues, and speak with reference to the future of all children on the planet.  \r\n\r\nRegardless of whether a group consists of men or women or both, having a matrifocal orientation means that people ask, How is the problem we perceive exacerbated by patriarchy, and how has our way of responding to it been limited by patriarchal thinking?\"  Resisting androcentric norms by putting womens perspectives in the center, rather than the periphery, of social debates is a first step toward undermining patriarchy and the social ills it perpetuates.\r\n\r\nOne problem with the Matrifocal pattern is its potential to reinforce male-female dichotomies. Whenever people speak up for traditionally feminine goals and valuesparticularly when they use the role of motherhood for political leverage--they run the risk of reifying patriarchal beliefs about the essential nature of women. Many reactionary movements have argued that their goals and strategies are in the best interests of women, and female voices are often used to promote these messages.   Many western feminists, for example, have been hesitant to organize under the banner of motherhood not only because many women chose not to be mothers, but also because such representations may inadvertently bolster the idea that motherhood is womens single most important function in society.  Activist who use a matrifocal orientation must be careful to distinguish between biological femaleness and matrifocal goals.  There are many males that value peace, nurturance, care for those in needs, collaborative problem solving, and an end to reward-oriented hierarchies.  There are also many females that are not interested in creating a just society and prefer to amass what benefits they can within the current social order; some fully support patriarchy. Matrifocal is not synonymous with female or maternal.\r\n\r\nA second problem with a matrifocal orientation is the misperception that everyone who adopts it will, or should, agree on particular social goals and political strategies.  They wont.  What is shared by people who adopt a matrifocal orientation is a consciousness that overcoming problems of violence, economic oppression, and gender oppression, requires replacing patriarchy with an alternative social order, and that increasing womens participation in the public sphere is one step in such a transformation.', 'A matrifocal orientation keeps the system of patriarchy visible so that alternatives can be imagined and created.', NULL, 525, 526, '2006-10-18 17:02:57', '2006-10-18 14:59:03', NULL, NULL, 'TESC', NULL, 313, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Individuals reflect on their own lived experience. Communities provide first-hand knowledge of the effects of change. Specialized knowledge is objective and reliable, within single frameworks. Organizational knowledge offers the political and administrative systems that can ensure the desired change. Holistic knowledge illuminates the essence or core purpose. Yet all of these are needed for mutual decisions towards a healthy, just and sustainable future (Brown 2006).\r\n\r\nEach knowledge culture was found to reject the contributions of the others.  Individual knowledge is dismissed as anecdote, community knowledge as gossip, specialist knowledge as jargon, organisational knowledge as plotting, and holistic knowledge as airy-fairy. Yet all five knowledge cultures have to learn to accept each other\'s contribution if there is to be a constructive synthesis. A sustainable synthesis calls for commitment to respecting their individual contributions while strengthening their connections. This represents a fundamental change in the way we think. \r\n\r\nTools found to assist in this transformational change include David Bohm\'s Rules of Dialogue, namely, maintain open communication, suspend judgment, separate inquiry and advocacy, clarify assumptions, listen to yourself, and remain open to the unexpected Bohm 1996). Concerted change requires all the knowledge cultures to join in the stages of open learning, as described by David Kolb: developing principles, defining parameters, designing for potential and doing and reviewing the new practice (Keen, Brown, and Dyball 2005).    \r\n\r\nThese suggested strategies for collective thinking were tested in three sites: an isolated desert town wanting a green town park, a tightly-packed beach-side suburb needing to control oceans of tourist waste, and an Indigenous community wishing to become self-supporting.

Thus, although specific incidents of invasion, slavery, apartheid and genocide may appear to be receding into the irretrievable past, they are never altogether absent from humankind\'s collective memories. As Robert Putnam states, \"Networks of civic engagement embody past success at collaboration which can serve as a cultural template for future collaboration\" (2000). Unfortunately these cultural \"templates\" encode past collaborative evils of the past, as well, and these are recycled all too regularly. Can humankind escape this cycle?', 'Societies are the sum total of their past events. The events of the past that have not been successfullyreconciled haunt the present. Projects that endeavor to help address social problems may be well served by examining historical memory and reconsidering how to respond appropriately.', 'Our memory of the past must guide the responsibility we accept in the present for the future. Without this linkage over time I could steal your belongings with no guilt or responsibility. Of course this has happened on a large scale throughout history. One group will murder, displace or enslave another and enjoy the fruits of their sins for lifetimes. Each passing day tends to legitimize &mdash; but never really erase &mdash; the misdeeds of history. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, misremembering history, is institutionalized. It\'s important to understand the motivation and the implications of intentional (let alone unintentional!) misrepresentation of history. Thus in the United States, the enslavement of Africans and the devastation of Native American communities as well as the militaristic forays of recent years including saturation bombing of civilian Japanese populations in World War II to the catastrophic Viet Nam War to the recent illegal invasion of Iraq are generally downplayed and sugar-coated. According to these re-writers of history, Americans always proceed with the best of intentions, perhaps marked by an occasional yet guileless misstep. With ubiquitous misinformation how can the next generation fully understand their country &mdash; with its successes as well as its failures &mdash; and make wise decisions in the future? Howard Zinn\'s <i>People\'s History of the United States</i> serves as an important (though still vastly underutilized) counter-balance to these trends and could also serve as an excellent model for other countries and regions as well as for various economic, political, and religious ideologies. \r\n\r\nWhat can/should people to be done to reconcile past sins and heal historical trauma? Although this question has rarely been addressed peacefully, thoughtfully and effectively throughout humankind\'s vast history, the large number of projects now in progress shows one hopeful sign of our era. According to Richard Falk, the Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany, and directed against Jews primarily as well as against the Roma, Gays, and other groups, marked a central historical marker in this regard. Since that time, movements for redress of war crimes of Japan against China, redress for indigenous people throughout the world, and tribunals and commissions focusing on war crimes and other transgressions have been launched. \r\n\r\nPeople are engaging in innovative projects that help people confront and understand and, hopefully, reconcile the present and future. Some of these examples include the courageous work of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo who publicly confront the abuse of power with photographs of \"the disappeared\" from Argentina\'s \"dirty war\" to seek justice and reconciliation with the past. Other examples to explore include the Seder ritual celebrated by Jews around the world, the post-war efforts in Germany to come to terms with their past, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission work in post-apartheid South Africa (and subsequently in many other regions), and the reparations efforts to help compensate African-Americans for the enslavement of their ancestors. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, the North Carolina General Assembly commissioned a report on an event that had been covered up for over 100 years &mdash; a violent revolt and coup in 1898 that was directed against blacks by white vigilantes in Wilmington, North Carolina. Unwilling to wait until the results of the (fixed) election took effect according to law, white supremacists seized city government, burned black-owned businesses and murdered 100 or more blacks in the streets and in their houses. According to John DeSantis, the draft report released in 2005 concluded that \"the rioting and coup fully ended black participation in local government until the civil rights era, and was a catalyst for the development of Jim Crow laws in North Carolina\" (2006). The report stated that, \"Because Wilmington rioters were able to murder blacks in daylight and overthrow Republican government without penalty or federal intervention, everyone in the state, regardless of race, knew that the white supremacy campaign was victorious on all fronts\" (DeSantis, 2006). \r\n\r\nNot only did this event disenfranchise several generations of black families in the Wilmington area but it actually ushered in a wave of similar actions and intimidation all over the South and became a model for actions in other cities including Atlanta, Georgia in 2006. Interestingly, whites and blacks were both wary of bringing this ugly historical incident back to public visibility and awareness. But what to do with the knowledge that a large number of people were brutalized and murdered (which led to a decades-long denial of basic civil rights) by a large number of people whose great grandchildren are undoubtedly still living in the region. The fact that this historical information has been sequestered for so long, especially in a region of the country that is well-known for its interest in history shows the prevalence of selective historical memory &mdash; which in itself represents many challenges for an exercise such as this. \r\n\r\nThe function of collective memory should promote healing, to set up patterns of behavior that constructively parses history to avoid  future problems and to teach each other through mistakes. The intent is not to blame or punish the descendants of people who perpetuated misdeeds both great and small &mdash; after all, who if anybody would be immune to that historical ensnarement &mdash; but to encourage people to reason together and strive for reconciliation. Ideally the descendants, especially those who have prospered since that time, would play a role in the design of mechanisms and policies to atone for and help reconcile and help redress the sins of the past especially for those who have suffered the most.\r\n\r\nIn another region and in another era, Veran Matic (2004) eloquently described the rationale why the B92 radio station he works for in Serbia, in the former Yugoslavia, keeps working the way they do. <blockquote><em> If we do not grasp our recent past, we will build our present and our future on false assumptions, beliefs and stereotypes\r\n If we do not face the errors of our past we will again seek excuses for our present in the same place Milosevic sought them  the guilt of others, global conspiracy and so on, rather than in the weaknesses of the society.  These weaknesses must be faced in order to understand reality\r\n If we do not fully comprehend our reality, reform programs will be based on false premises\r\n The problems of the repressed past will boomerang, like the permanent problem of lack of cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, or the problem of mafia and police links, or problems with the business elite who amassed their wealth through privileges granted by Milosevic.\r\n Without a radical break with the past there will be no change in the cultural model under Milosevic, which has overwhelmed the entire society, from culture, through education, to the media.\r\n Unless we face the past, we will never know what is good for us and what is bad for us\r\n By not facing the past, we neglect our duty to the future, leaving new generations to pay our debts, just as our generations have paid for the repression of the past of World War II in our country.  This gave rise to new vengeance forty years later\r\n And, finally, without engagement we will be unable to demonstrate authentic belief and strong will to institute changes that should benefit every single individual. </em></blockquote>\r\n\"Forgetting\" the past is not desirable, nor in reality is it really possible. Although Matic is speaking specifically about recent injustice in the former Yugoslavia, his message is universal. Through hard work by all concerned, healing historical wounds can be accomplished. Although it may seem impossible, those who have inherited the results of yesterday\'s actions must relive insofar as it can be done, the past sacrificing as necessary to set a more just course for the future.\r\n\r\nThe best outcome of this pattern, a valuable gift to our descendants, would be the  attenuation or, better, the cessation of current practices of brutality, exploitation, impoverishment and oppression.', 'Think about and confront memory in creative, productive and sensitive ways.

The need for an international collaboration is also connected to develop the means for the international working class to take control of their destiny.

This even which is held at the Korean Broadcasting Company Stadium brings together the experiences of the working class through a cultural and theatrical production that is choreographed to the minute over 8 hours. Such a festival could and should be held in every country that ties together the song, poetry, music and art of struggle.

Yet,  according in a review of Alexander\'s work in a Harvard Design Magazine review Saunders faults Alexanders \"New Age flower-child wistfulness\" when Alexander speaks of the health benefits that are associated with a deeper connection with nature.\r\n\r\nIn cities and in developed areas around the world generally many of humankinds roots are barely visible. In the U.S., for example, only 2% of people who live in rural areas are engaged in farming. Even more astounding is the fact that \"rural\" is no longer rural: a large percentage of rural dwellers live within 25 miles of a city. But far from being a nostalgic look back, discovering, cultivating and building on our radical center can be a wellspring for creative preparations for the future. \r\nWe are learning the hard way that \"estrangement from the animate earth has negative consequences for human functioning\" (Barlett, 2005) and people are making strides towards a closer touch. City dwellers are now demanding Pea patches and other urban gardening opportunities. People are learning the value of having plants close by when, for example, convalescing from disease, operation or abuse (Tesh, ____). In South Central Los Angeles, in an economically disadvantaged part of the city close to the scene of the Rodney King riots of 1992, 14 acres of land that were destined to become home for a giant trash-to-energy incinerator was purchased by the city through eminent domain for $4.8 million. Through a series of events, the city granted temporary use of the land for community gardens that turned into 12 years and the 350 families have cultivated the urban farm since that day. In 2006, in spite of large public demonstations, the farm, lungs for the city in a car-centric metropolis, was reclaimed by the city to be sold back to the original owner. The land will be used for light manufacturing or warehouses. \r\n\r\nIn the introduction to her excellent book (2005) Peggy Barlett recounts many of the ways through which we have lost or nearly lost our connections to our roots &mdash; and the possible perils that such losses may engender. She also shows how the benefits from <i>reconnecting</i> spread in unexpected ways: <blockquote>\"As volunteers clean up a trash-filled urban stream, for example, they absorb a new concept of watershed. They learn that parking lots, driveways, and lawn chemicals affect water quality and stream insect life. People who might have never thought about mayflies or runoff water temperature develop a new relationship to the stream ecosystem and indicators of its health (Barlett, 2002). Concerns about urban air quality also draw attention to the ecological matrix of life. Trees provide \"services\" by removing air pollutants, retaining storm water, cooling temperatures, and providing habit and food for other species. Restoration work of prairies and forests builds attachment to the natural world in a more grounded local way than a more diffuse embrace of nature in the abstract (Light and Higgs, 1997). </blockquote> According to Barlett, \"Modern cities make distance from nature possible for a larger group than in the past.\" She also raises the idea that \"Urban place is a locale as well for the enactment of human hierarchy. Distance from the natural world may be connected to power over the lower classes and their labor.\" Certainly the arts, the priesthood, the seats of governmet, and the banks are found in cities. \r\n\r\nOne intriguing concept is how our very thought patterns &mdash; our abstractions, human-centrism, and economic calculations &mdash; may exclude nature and our roots. Barlett, for examples, shows how anthropology, sociology and the other social sciences exclude humankind\'s connections with other life forms, natural phenomenon and own past. Of course from a capitalist perspective, nature has \"value\" only when it has a \"price\" and potential for profit. Unfortunately many people find themselves \"priced-out\" of their own land and their own culture legacy. Access to unexploited and unspoiled nature, our common roots is increasingly the domain of the wealthy. The most dangerous of these tendencies, however, may be that we forget our own history as a part and product of nature and hence our ability to reformulate a more harmonious connection with nature. \r\n\r\nHow are we supposed to do this pattern? For most of humankind\'s progress through the centuries nature was abundant and humankind scarce. Nature was something that could be \"conquered.\" Some of the world\'s religions informed us that God intended us to have \"dominion\" over nature. We can\'t really \"go back\" to  the primeval time of our \"roots\" &mdash; nor would we want to. We will not and can not abandon our cities and \"return\" to  a state of nature. But at the same time we must boldly explore the idea of living in some sort of closer harmony with nature and the forces of life that we implicitly think we can ignore. \r\n\r\nYet for the timelessness and presumed innocence of our roots, immense damage has been wrought over time \"in the name of\" roots: blood, tradition, purity, the soil. We know that people from the city are not \"better\" than people from the country. We also know that the reverse is not true; for actually many people in the country have also lost their feel for nature. We don\'t invoke the idea of \"roots\" to pit one group against another but to relate the two in common bonds.\r\n\r\nBarlett believes that \"there are unanticipated benefits to collective and individual well-being with the reconnection to the natural world, an often-neglected dimension of the emerging paradigm shift toward a more sustainable society\" and \"part of a shifting paradigm that locates humankind within the biosphere.\" Thinking holistically we can imagine and create new opportunities for reconnecting with our roots that have unxpected benefits: \"a community garden in New York City may replace an abandoned lot and come to be a social focus for many who live nearby.\" Barlett again, \"Community gardens not only provide nutritious food and conviviality with neighbors, but can build a different sense of self through a new awareness of growing cycles, weather and human agency.\"\r\n\r\nFor example, <a href=\"http://www.southcentralfarmers.org/\">South Central Farmers</a> and their <a href=\"http://www.current.tv/studio/media/7020189\">current struggle</a> to maintain the urban farm land.', 'Barlett presents \"several layers of connections to nature\" including knowledge; emerging emotional attachment; purposeful action; new personal choices and ethical action and commitments to political action. The plants that we eat of course have literal roots that climb backwards, down through the soil, searching for nutrients. Humankinds roots also reach back through time and space and are likewise eternal.', NULL, 725, 874, '2006-10-30 01:46:54', '2006-10-30 01:46:36', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

While technological advances in information and communications can serve to democratize the exchange of information, much of the public discourse is dominated by those with a vested interest in protecting positions of power and influence. We need to rediscover the fundamental role of communications in eliciting a reenchanted engagement in the task of building a truly humane society.', 'This is a meta-pattern that sets the framework for the ethical development and application of communications technologies at all levels', 'Communications technologies are, like all technologies, value neutral tools that can be used to invite or intimidate, to illuminate or conceal, to liberate or manipulate, to release or stifle creativity, to provide opportunities or erect barriers, to create open communities or gated enclaves, to welcome diversity or rehearse ancient prejudice.\r\n\r\nToday we are well aware, although not always well in control, of the sophisticated craftsmanship that can guide the use of these tools and technologies. In the satiric film, <i>Thank You for Smoking</i>, the tobacco lobbyist instructs his son, If you argue correctly, you are never wrong. We can understand and laugh/cry at this perspective, for we see it reenacted daily, not only in commercials but in what passes for reasoned political debate.\r\n\r\nThe objective complexity of the issues we face can become even more resistant to solutions when communications tools are used to twist logic, distorting even the smallest ambiguity to create the perception of deadlock for the purpose of freezing the status quo and preserving current imbalances. \r\n\r\nThis can be seen in the current debate over global warming. A recent survey on the attitude of the American public on global warming by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that Roughly four-in-ten (41%) believe human activity such as burning fossil fuels is causing global warming, but just as many say either that warming has been caused by natural patterns in the earth\'s environment (21%), or that there is no solid evidence of global warming (20%) and that public opinion about global warming is deeply polarized along political lines. This reveals a fundamental challenge of communications in our times. Statistics and scientific evidence alone do not change human behavior or engage people, at a visceral and passionate level, in the resolution of intractable challenges, and can at worst be manipulated to create a baffling fog that stifles effective, concerted action.\r\n\r\nWe must occasionally step back to reframe the immediate controversy in the broader outlines of the human drama and reestablish the line between wordsmith and spinmeister.\r\nFor nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another defining moments of sheer fascination and mystery that reveal a profound sense of connectionthe birth of a child, the death of a loved one, an unexpected encounter with the sheer vastness of sea or space, or the intricate complexity of nature, accompanied by the inescapable feeling of somehow being a participant in this vastness and awe-inspiring complexity. There is a reawakening sense of wonder that in itself makes sense, an intuitive appreciation for the sheer mystery of life and for the opportunity to be a part of how that mystery continues to unfold and enliven human events, relationships and structures.\r\n\r\nBerman and others point to re-enchantmentof the world, science, life, nature, and art as the key to not just survival but to reconstructing the fundamental structures of society in the context of mystery and compassion. Gablik, in The Reenchantment of Art writes that re-enchantment refers to that change in the general social mood toward a more pragmatic idealism and a more integrated value system that brings head and heart together in an ethic of care, as part of the healing of the world.\r\n\r\nThis pragmatic idealism provides a far different and ironically more practical foundation for forming public consensus around serious problems such as global warming. The recent strengthening of collaborations bringing together otherwise conflicting evangelical and progressive wings of Christianity around stewardship of the Earth is one sign of how foundational awe and wonder can lead to a willingness to responsibly change behaviors and social structures.\r\n\r\nThe various forms and modalities of communications in themselves have the power to bring head and heart together. From the primal artistry of cave paintings to multimedia Web sites, from the evocative epics of oral tradition to the sophisticated arguments of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, from the visual arts to music, dance, and poetry, we have experienced the ability of communication to reawaken a common sense of mystery and fascination and reopen our own pathways of creative participation.\r\n\r\nThere are practical implications of this perspective in the civic sphere. Sharp and Beaudry discovered that communications, properly understood as dialogue, connection and engagement in the process of being a citizen and living in a community was the essence of revitalization. Communications as engagement represents shifts from one-way to two-way, from message-driven to dialogue-driven, from intrusive and persuasive to invitational and deliberative. \r\n\r\nSimilarly in our own community development experience we observed that the reason we were going through the hassle of attempting to \"keep everybody informed all the time\" wasn\'t simply to get information to everyone--we wanted people to know what was happening so that they would want to be a part of it. The newsletters, community meetings, neighborhood gatherings, special interest group sessions, door-to-door surveys, project reports, flyers and posters, along with the work days, inkind (donation) circuits, planning events, leadership training, community festivals and celebrationsall shared the common motivation of sparking and sustaining engagement over the long haul. All served as \"communications channels,\" and while each channel had a \"message\" to deliver (we weren\'t just telling good stories to prospective donors--we really needed that lumber!), but the subtext, the underlying intention, was a persistent invitation to participate in the reweaving of the communitys social fabric. We knew we had \"won,\" when someone \"new\" showed up, when someone \"old\" took on a new role (and yet someone else stepped into the gap), when a surprising new connection provided the solution to a stubbornly resistant problem.\r\n\r\nThe highest goal of communications, then, is to demystify and reenchant by transparently conveying meaning in a way that invites, encourages, and supports free and unfettered engagement in alleviating suffering and celebrating the human enterprise. In this context, communication itself becomes not just a reflection but a direct expression of this engagement. And in this respect, effective communication patterns take on the quality that cannot be named of Alexanders <i>Timeless Way of Building</i>.', 'Therefore apply technologies of communication in service to humanity, based in a sense of wonder and compassion.  Orchestrate the selection, development and implementation of communications tools and technologiesdrawing upon the entire palette of printed, broadcast, face-to-face, and Internet-based modalitiesto invites, encourage, and supports broad-based engagement. Develop and incorporate methods to elicit reenchantmentincluding, perhaps, personal stories, poetry, music, artto reframe complex issues in the context of a shared experience of fascination and mystery.', NULL, 872, 452, '2006-11-19 01:28:22', '2006-11-19 01:28:03', NULL, NULL, 'Gillgren Communication Services, Inc.', NULL, 327, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

A related problem, which may be more insidious, arises when two or more people think they\'re speaking the same language when they\'re not. \"Languages,\" furthermore, are of various types, in addition to what we usually think of &mdash; English, Japanese, or Hindi, for example. Some people seem to speak only \"Technical\" or \"Post Modern Academician\" which can be incomprehensible from outside those cultures. Finally, there is often an implied \"pecking order\" in which one language (and its speakers) are viewed as dominant or more important while other languages (and its speakers) are devalued and bear an unequal share of the burden of understanding.', 'This pattern applies in any situation where two or more languages are employed. Here \"language\" is applied broadly. For example, with global climate change looming, scientists must be able to engage in two-way conversations effectively; social scientists must be able to do the same if their work is to have relevance and resonance. Translation takes place when any two worlds of discourse are bridged.', 'This includes translation between systems of knowledges (e.g. theorist to practitioner) as well as translations between different languages.\r\n\r\n<i>\"A text is a machine for eliciting translations.\" </i> &mdash; Umberto Eco, Translating and Being Translated\r\n\r\nAlthough cultures are maintained through a variety of institutions, the use of a common language may be the deepest and most abiding tie that binds a culture together. Language is a reflection of, and a window into, culture.\r\n\r\nOf course people speak many languages; children may invent secret words to describe the world they see and would like to see, Slang is shared by youth culture, academic disciplines use certain phrases, neolisms etc. to participate in a shared intellectual pursuit, while religious communities have expressions of sacred and profane ideas of special significance. \r\n\r\nIf, however, every person in the world spoke only one language, a language that had no words in common, then each group would be, in essence, a group by itself cut off from the rest of the social world.  Trade would be virtually impossible as would diplomacy and sharing of intellectual creations, technological and artistic.  War is one social activity that probably would not be hampered by this barrier to communication (although negotiating an end to the hostilities would be extremely difficult, if not possible.) \r\n\r\nThus translation is a bridge that connects two or more cultures or two or more people. Translation allows two or more groups or people to come to a common understanding and it allows them to take advantage of the special or expert knowledge of the other.\r\n\r\nTranslation is also a social process that is embedded in particular social contexts and is subjected to the dictates of that context. For example, the burden of translation is often expected to fall upon the lower status or less dominant group. Thus, many Spanish speakers in the U.S. are \"expected\" to learn English (majority rules &mdash; in more ways than one). People who lack fluency in the dominant language (English, BBC English, or Techno-speak, for example) are often considered ignorant. \r\n\r\nUmberto Eco captures a key difficulty in translation: <blockquote>\"Equivalence in meaning cannot be take as a satisfactory criterion for a correct translation, first of all because in order to define the still undefined notion of translation one would have to employ a notion as obscure as equivalence of meaning, and some people think that meaning is that which remains unchanged in the process of translation. We cannot even accept the naïve idea that equivalence in meaning is provided by synonymy, since it is commonly accepted that there are no complete synonyms in language. Father is not a synonym for daddy, daddy is not a synonym for papà, and père is not a synonym for padre.\" <br />&nbsp;&mdash; Umberto Eco (2001).</blockquote>As Eco makes clear in the quotations above, words in languages dont have one-to-one equivalence.  For that reason successful translation relies on a reasonable yet partial solution (actually a type of <i>negotiation</i>) to a number of interdependent problems. Totally accurate translation is impossible but imperfect translation is ubiquitous &mdash; and essential. Moreover, the context of the words in the sentence, the sentence in the paragraph, etc. etc. that is being translated, all within the context of the inspiration and intent and audience are all relevant when translating.\r\n\r\nTranslation, therefore, is not a mechanical act, but a skilled and empathetic re-rewriting or re-performing of a text or utterance or intention in which an understanding of the two cultures being bridged is essential. More precisely, an understanding of the two respective audiences, intended and otherwise, the vocabulary they employ, their education, biases, fears, etc. are all central to a good, solid and mutually satisfactory translation. \r\n\r\nAlthough the following quotation is specifically examining the differences of psychology and sociology by their focus of individuals and collective bodies respectively, it captures a central question in translation. <blockquote>To address the problem of different and incommensurable perspectives in the human sciences, two issues need to be considered. First, we must find a way to link perspectives without simply reducing one to another. One guiding assumption of this volume is that attempts to account for complex human phenomena by invoking a perspective grounded in a single discipline are as unlikely as were the attempts of each of the three blind men to come with <em>the</em> true account of an elephant. The goal, then, is to arrive at an account &mdash; a kind of \"translation at the crossroads\" &mdash; that would make it possible to <em>link, but not reduce,</em> one perspective to another. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; James V. Wertsch (1998)  </blockquote>', 'Think about the critical role of translation and, if possible, become a translator &mdash; or at least when the need arises where you can help bridge a gap of understanding.

Beyond the losses incurred thus far, there is evidence that the trend is increasing as languages such as English, Spanish, and Swahili are displacing languages that are less prominent in the world media and language sphere. Losing humankind\'s linguistic diversity diminishes our collective ability to perceive and think about the world in a holistic, multi-faceted and rich way.', 'Everybody who communicates with other people employs language. To a large extent, the language that we use places constraints on what -- and <em>how</em> -- we think. Everybody has a stake in promoting linguistic diversity although some people are better positioned to help.', 'In 1992, Michael Krauss, a language professor at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, predicted that half of the world\'s languages would become extinct within the next century. Although languages periodically have become extinct throughout history, the frequency of language death today is unprecedented. Krauss reported that of the 20 tongues still known to the state\'s indigenous people, only two of were being taught to children. A 1990 survey in Australia, cited in a article by W. Wayt Gibbs, \"found that 70 of the 90 surviving Aboriginal languages were no longer used regularly by all age groups. The same was true for all but 20 of the 175 Native American languages spoken or remembered in the U.S.\" The \"ethnologue\", an Internet resource that lists over 7,000 languages currently in use worldwide, contains over 400 languages which are thought to be in imminent danger of extinction.\r\n\r\nIt may be that our everyday familiarity with language prevents us from respecting the fact that \"...any language is a supreme achievement of a uniquely human collective genius, as divine and endless a mystery as a living organism,\" as Krauss reminds us. Linguistic diversity can be thought as analogous to biological diversity. In that vein, Krauss asks his readers, \"Should we mourn the loss of Eyak or Ubykh any less than the loss of the panda or California condor?\"\r\n\r\nMany of the imperiled languages are those of indigenous people. Unfortunately for the rest of us, the world-views of indigenous people, especially in relationship to the environment, is one of the vantage points we can\'t afford to lose. David Crystal, writing in Language Death, states that, \"Most westerners are infants in their knowledge of the environment, and how to behave towards it, compared with the indigenous peoples, for whom the environment is part of the business of survival.\" It\'s a sobering thought to ponder how much mass media may be determining what\'s in our \"environment\" and, hence, in our \"knowledge of the environment.\" Is it true that American teenagers have 63 words for shopping?\r\n\r\nLinguists are now employing a variety of techniques to document the world\'s endangered languages before they are lost forever.  This usually involves field work in which a dictionary and grammar guide are produced.  Often recordings are made of native speakers. But looking beyond the last-ditch \"capture\" of a language before it dies forever. a variety of techniques are being used to try to build back a viable language community.  A program devised by Leanne Hinton acquired funding to pay both fluent indigenous speakers and younger learners. \r\n\r\nWhat else can be done? David Crystal lists six factors that he believes can help resusitate an endangered language. An endangered language will progress if its speakers: <ol><li>increase their prestige within the dominant community</li><li> increase their wealth relative to the dominant community</li><li> increase their legitimate power in the eyes of the dominant community</li><li>have a strong presence in the educational system</li><li>can write their language down</li><li>can make use of electronic technology</li></ol>\r\nHans-Jurgen Sasse believes that \"collective doubts about the usefullness of language loyalty\" among the speakers of a language can presage its demise. The speakers themselves can of course strive to maintain their language.  The world outside of that language community can play a role by respecting linguistic diversity, often by dropping prejudices and a bias for monolingualism. David Crystal believes that this bias is, at least to some degree, a product of colonialism, that is now being promoted by economics. When bilingualism flourishes, speakers can participate in the world beyond their language community intellectually and commercially while maintaining their own community, identity and  heritage. \r\n\r\nAs with other thorny problems, no single answer exists. Solutions that work in some places have no effects in others. Education of one sort or another will play a large role in language maintenance; the language must be passed on from older to younger generations.  Artistic and other forms of cultural expression can serve as an outlet for creative impulses that can also be enjoyed by the world beyond their community. \r\n\r\n<font size=\"-1\">Introductory graphic, \"Endangered Languages of North America,\" is from the web site, http://www.si.edu/i+d/lang.big.html</font>', 'Due to their particular knowledge and expertise, linguists are often at the forefront of the struggle for linguistic diversity.

(226, 216, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Education necessarily promotes and replicates values and does so in many ways.  Often, teachers and administrators use the asymmetrical power relationships inherent in most educational settings to deliberately promulgate their own set of values. Even when not done deliberately, values are communicated. Yet, neither the conscious nor the implicit promulgation of values is typically designed with thought to the appropriateness of these values for the future. This does not imply that newer values are always better than older values; but clearly at least some values of the past must to be re-thought in the light of huge global populations, diminishing natural resources, and the danger and ultimate futility of armed conflict.', 'To avoid simply having students parrot platitudes without deep understanding, an approach to values education has been proposed that uses moral dilemmas for discussion and encourages participation in communities where conflicts and resolutions will be a natural outgrowth (Nucci & Weber, 1991).  While the issue of values in education has always been important, our contemporary context raises its priority.    \r\n\r\nThe world is changing at a rapid pace and many of today\'s implicit \"values\" are counter-productive to a viable future (e.g., judging an individual\'s worth by the size and power of their automobile; believing that a child must live constantly in an environment kept at 70-72 degrees Fahrenheit; that authority is always right and must be obeyed; that the way to success is to follow the crowd).  Indeed, many values promulgated by society are contradictory.  For instance, American society encourages over-indulgence in high fat, high-sugar foods and simultaneously insists that only people with perfect bodies are worthwhile.  While children may be taught during an hour-long health class that too much fat and sugar are bad for the body, this hardly constitutes a sufficient antidote to thousands of expertly designed advertisements that say just the opposite.  The capacity of adults to wreak great havoc on others is at an all-time high.  Ethical decisions have always been crucial, but the consequences of unethical behavior have taken on even greater signficance.', 'Children normally develop morally as well as cognitively as they mature (Piaget, 1964; Kohlberg, 1989).  Ideally this comes about through acting in the social world, observing consequences, and interacting with peers.  Turiel (1983) pointed out that children develop judgments in two separate but inter-related domains, the conventional and the ethical.  The appropriateness of clothing is a question of convention that varies from society to society and from setting to setting.  The appropriateness of killing is an ethical issue in every society.  However, disregarding a recognized convention (e.g., appearing nude in inappropriate circumstances), can cause sufficient disruption and discomfort to raise genuine ethical issues.  \r\n\r\nEducation is often thought of as a process that helps individuals gain knowledge (vocabulary, rules of syntax, geographic locations, events of historic significance) and skills (parsing sentences, doing research, organizing results, writing, typing).  While this is true, education also necessarily promotes values.  Values are involved in curriculum choices, the materials chosen within that curriculum, how the material is presented, and the range of correct answers.  For example, primarily focusing history studies on the history of ones own country promotes the value of chauvinism.  Moreover, placing emphasis within that history on presidents, generals, wars, and victories (with little to say about changes that arise from and affect people in general) promotes the values of authoritarianism and militarism. Material focuses on white Christian males promotes racism and sexism. Presenting subject material using a lecture style with little chance for debate, discussion, or dialogue, further reinforces the value of authoritarianism. Evaluating  student progress based primarily on the ability to recite specific known facts, also promotes the value of authoritarianism.  \r\n\r\n	A study published in the American Psychologist a few decades ago showed that the best predictor of college grades in introductory psychology classes was not high school GPA or SAT scores but the degree of agreement in values between instructor and student.  An interesting case study of the degree to which values are inherent even in so-called objective matters comes from the Ph.D. dissertation of Evans, a student of Minsky at MIT.  Evans built an AI program to solve multiple choice figure analogy problems.  A:B::C:D1, D2, D3, D4, or D5.  The program found relationships mapping between A and B and then tried to apply those same relationships mapping C to each of the possible D answers.  His program worked.  In fact, his program worked too well--all answers were correct.  In order to make the program pick the same answers as the test developers, he had to inculcate his program with the same value priorities as the test developers.  For instance, according to test makers, it was (implicitly) more elegant to rotate a figure within the 2-D plane than to rotate out in 3-D space.  \r\n\r\nThe inculcation of values is pervasive and subtle.  Much of the value indoctrination that occurs in schools is unconscious.  Even when conscious attention is given to values, there seems to be little appreciation of the extent to which children are subjected to much more powerful indoctrination via paid advertisements in print, TV, radio, games, and movies.', 'Educational institutions, individual teachers, parents, concerned citizens and children themselves must work to uncover and understand the values that are being taught as well as to design the entire educational experience to foster those values that will help make for a sustainable and healthy future.  For a whole school approach to values, see http://www.valueseducation.edu.au/values/ \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, a constructivist approach to education, while arguably important for deep understanding in topics as various as science and mathematics to poetry interpretation, such an approach is particularly vital to values education, and especially when values of the past may have to be re-thought for their appropriateness to the future.

The more we produce and the more we purchase the more we have so called progress and prosperity.  However, the production, processing, and consumption, of commodities requires the extraction and use of natural resources (wood, ore, fossil fuels, water); it requires the creation of factories and factory complexes whose operation creates toxic byproducts, while the use of commodities themselves (e.g. automobiles) creates pollutants and waste. (Allyn and Bacon, 1999)   The number of consumers and their individual and collective behaviors drive materialization.  (Daedalus  1996)', 'Human societies now face unintended and ironic consequences of their own mechanical, chemical, medical, social, and financial ingenuity. (Iona Zira - 2003)  The production and consumption of products is destructive, in the long run, to the environment and is a contributing factor to poverty and hunger around the world.  A long list of social and ecological problems can not be solved without a less consumptive society and the dematerialization of our natural resources.', 'Dematerialization is a technological term that defines the reduction of material used per unit quality of life. You may have noticed the plastic sack at the grocery store getting thinner, but it is still strong enough to carry your groceries.  Over the years, it may seem that you can squeeze the pop can you drink from more easily with your hand though you may not have gotten any stronger.  These types of changes in products are the result of dematerialization, using fewer natural resources in products, using more recycled resources, and extending the life of products.\r\n\r\nIndustrial ecology is the study of the totality of the relationships between different industrial activities, their products, and the environment. It is intended to identify ways to optimize the network of all industrial processes as they interact and live off each other, in the sense of a direct use of each other\'s material and energy wastes and products as well as economic synergism. The macroscopic picture of materialization can help raise key research questions and set priorities among the numerous studies of materials flows and networks that might be undertaken. It puts these in a dynamic context of both technical and market change. (Daedalus  1996)\r\n\r\nDematerialization of unit products affects, and is influenced by, a number of factors besides product quality. These include ease of manufacturing, production cost, size and complexity of the product, whether the product is to be repaired or replaced, and the amount of waste to be generated and processed. These factors influence one another. For example, the ease of manufacture of a particular product in smaller and lighter units may result in lower production cost and cheaper products of lower quality, which will be replaced rather than repaired on breaking down. Although a smaller amount of waste will be generated on a per-unit basis, more units will be produced and disposed of, and there may be an overall increase in waste generation at both the production and the consumption ends.  (Dr. Braden Allenby- 1992) Through industrial ecololgy we can determine best outcomes using a wider, more global outlook of the affects of our activities on the environment.\r\n\r\nIn a functional economy consumers can purchase function, rather than a physical product, from a service provider. \"For example, we don\'t want the washing machine, we want clean, dry washing; we don\'t want the drill, we want to have a picture hanged.\" (Rolf Jucker - 2000)  Through dematerialization a physical product is replaced by a non-physical product or service reducing a company\'s production, demand and use of physical products; and the end-user\'s dependence on physical products. This strategy realizes cost-savings in materials, energy, transportation, consumables, and the need to manage the eventual disposal and/or recycling of a physical product. Dematerialization may involve making a product smaller and lighter, replacing a material product with an immaterial substitute.  One common example of this that we currently practice is the replacement of postal mail with E-mail.  Reducing the use of material or infrastructure-intensive systems allows us to make changes like telecommuting versus the use of the automobile for work purposes. \r\n\r\nThe ease and speed of travel is a large contributing factor to the materialization of our world.  As a society we have spread out and continue to create a built environment all over the map because it is so quick and easy to get from here to there.  As we create wider, better roads, more cars fill the roadways.  The use of plastics in society is the by product of using too much oil to fuel our automobiles.  As a result the disposal of plastic waste is an increasing problem.  Not to mention the effect on the environment due to the incredible amount of industrialized metals, plastics, electronic materials, rubber, and glass it takes to manufacture each car.  A recent television ad with a woman talking about the need to protect the environment ended with this endearment, but, I love my car!  Attempts to dematerialize the automobile by using high strength steel and plastics to decrease mass but increase structural integrity are negatively offset by this kind of sentiment by consumers.\r\n\r\nA starting point for a sensible theory or practice of consumption has to be the insight that every time you buy and/or consume something--be it a tiny battery to keep your watch going or be it a TV, a car or a hamburger, you are making an impact on the social, economic, and ecological environment. In the words of Anwar Fazal, former president of the International Organization of Consumer Unions (IOCU): \"The act of buying is a vote for an economic and social model, for a particular way of producing goods. We are concerned with the quality of goods and the satisfactions we derive from them. But we cannot ignore the environmental impact, and working conditions under which products are made.\" Our relationship with these products or goods does not end with our enjoyment of possessing or consuming them. We are linked to them and perpetuate them and therefore share some direct responsibility for them.\" (Rolf Jucker - 2000)  \r\n  \r\nLife-styles also shape demand. Today, only a small fraction of consumption in wealthy nations (or communities) is actually for basic survival; most is for pleasure and to express one\'s standing in society. (Daedalus - 1996)  In a standup monologue, comedian George Carlin used humor to increase our awareness of society\'s obsessive behavior for material objects, That\'s all I want, that\'s all you need in life, is a .place for your stuff, ya know? A house is just a pile of stuff with a cover on itI can see it on your table, everybody\'s got a ...place for their stuff. .This is my stuff, that\'s your stuff, that\'ll be his stuff over there...And when you leave your house, you gotta lock it up. Wouldn\'t want somebody to come by and take some of your stuffThat\'s what your house is, a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get...more stuff! Sometimes you gotta move, gotta get a bigger house. Why? No room for your stuff anymore\"  Sometimes the beginning to an answer for a serious problem like too much materialism and consumerism is to create personal awareness.\r\n\r\nOf the three factors environmentalists often point to as responsible for environmental problems  population, technology, and consumption  consumption seems to get the least attention. One reason ... is that it may be the most difficult to change; our consumption patterns are so much a part of our lives that to change them would require a massive cultural overhaul, not to mention severe economic dislocation. A drop in demand for products, as economists note, brings on economic recession or even depression, along with massive unemployment.  This is so ingrained into the cultures of the wealthy nations, that the thought of massive adjustment of lifestyles and economic systems to a more sustainable consumption seems too much to consider. (Annup Shaw - 2005)  Taking a moderate approach with gradual or incremental changes in lifestyle  could increase the probability of an actual decrease in consumption.\r\n\r\nSubstantial progress has been made over the past century in decoupling economic growth and well-being from increasing primary energy use through increased efficiency. With this success some economists may come to think that dematerialization is a term for scientific processes and economic strategies alone and has nothing to do with materialism as a philosophy.  On the other hand there is increased realization that decoupling materials and affluence will be difficultmuch harder than decoupling carbon and prosperity.\" (Daedalus - 1996)  The term dematerialization applies to the individual act of buying less, consuming less and finding more meaning in our lives than the acquisition of material goods.  Downsizing our homes, our automobiles, our technological toys and entertainment systems, our cloths closets, and the consumptive habits we teach our children can help people simplify their lives and find other interests that create more meaning, value, and happiness.  Understanding the historical roots of materialism that have resulted in our modern affluence could also be key to decreasing our personal use and obsession with material goods in the built world.', 'Consumption has become a function of our culture that needs to be intentionally curbed. The growing role of knowledge, information, and culture should also make it possible to displace materials and energy with human intelligence and ingenuity. This would allow us to satisfy more basic human needs with far fewer resources. It would ostensibly also allow us to fit human economic activities within natural processes without disrupting them. Dematerialization is the future of an ecologically and economically balanced world.

They are lead by people who are often chosen for their position only because they fit easily within the institution. Institutions become focused on their own survival rather than their original and evolving missions and visions. Institutions and organizations replicate themselves through their hiring practices and competitive practices, preventing diversity and hence, innovation. Institutions become resistant to change, maintaining the belief (at least implicitly) that \"who they are now is who they should remain\".', 'A distributed management and operational model for institutions is required to support and sustain remote and rural communities. \r\nEstablishing innovation as a way of doing business to engage remote and rural communities in all regions requires an appreciation where people are employed, where they are producing valued products as well as delivering services that are an important part of the social and economic fabric of the region. \r\nIn many cases, success in fulfilling the mission of an institution can actually mean the \"death\" or transformation of their organization. Institutions that have some specified lifespan to fulfill their mandate can either disappear or change to accommodate the next challenge that is identified from its work and services.', 'Most institutions are positioned to deliver services from their operation center out to the region and the masses. Often, these institutions, their leaders and their corporate management models protect and maintain their existence without any regard for those they were intended to serve. Their development and sustainability strategies are built and maintained on the basic values of greed and exploitation of the people and regions they claim to serve. The exploitation and destruction of the environment, the people and rural communities is the long term result of these types of efforts by institutions.\r\n\r\nRegional hospitals, colleges and universities are three examples of institutions that sustain their operation centers in larger urban environments. They sustain their operation by drawing people to their facilities under the myth that they will be better served if they move to these centers. The professionals who work with clients in these institutions create a level of dependency that people have grown to accept. These efforts protect their positions and create wealth for the institution while draining local and regional resources. The reality that these institutions and corporations depend on communities to supply the resources required for their existence challenges their traditional model.\r\n\r\nThe real costs of developing and sustaining centralized, concrete environments have never been incorporated into the balance sheets of the institutions. These real costs the costs to the environment, the costs of destroying forests and the earth to extract natural resources for creating man-made environments where people are \"taken care of\" so a few individuals can become rich and powerful. The artificial comforts that some experience as a result of these environments should reflect these real costs of producing the food and water that sustain the lives of the people who work within these institutions; the energy they consume to have these comforts; as well as the poverty that others must experience so they can be comfortable within these artificial environments. The list of real costs is long and requires significant research to reflect the real exchanges that occur between the different sectors of society.\r\n\r\nOnce these real costs variables are included in any true management system, institutions and governments will need to look outside their \"glass bubbles\" work with others to find truly sustainable and equitable solutions. Management and program developers will need to find creative strategies to accommodate, work with and sustain communities, cultures and environments that have always existed and have been struggling to survive. \r\n\r\nBeing able to look outside of their comfortable worlds to support innovation and development with their neighbors requires a new set of values and priorities. These institutional values and priorities will be different from those that are presently in place to protect and sustain artificial and temporary facilities and environments. Partnering with others, trusting other people, understanding others, respecting other environments, cultures and people are values that should become part of any modern institutional culture and environment.\r\n\r\nThis transformation will benefit the institution by creating new opportunities and relationships. But it will also probably require some short-term pain to establish long-term gains. Finding creative ways to purchase and support services and products from other groups outside of the institution also requires finding creative ways to pay the real price for these products and services. Learning how to value and respect people and environments in remote and rural communities helps create these new opportunities and relationships.\r\n\r\nWorking with existing institutions and supporting their required change is a challenge. Starting over to create new institutions is only an option when there are opportunities and support for innovative groups and organizations that are able to overcome or counter the traditional institutional management model. But for most existing institutions, the entrenched infrastructure and investments created over the years require that they remain in place. \r\n\r\nInstitutions located in most small urban centers are an integral and historical part of their environment. Over the years they have contributed jobs and significant investment in the communities where they are located. By their very nature, they will continue to exist; the question becomes, however, will they be able to make the necessary adjustments for successfully accommodating these real operational costs within their own environments? \r\n\r\nThis type of change, with its associated challenges and opportunities, requires a transformation at all levels within existing institutions. This transformative work needs to be lead by innovative thinkers and new leaders who understand and respect the impact of their institution at the local, regional, national and international levels. The global village demands this type of relationship within institutions. As these new institutions evolve from within existing institutions or as new institutions are started, the required transformations are facilitated and supported by factors and forces both within and outside the organization.\r\n\r\nLeaders of older organizations often selected in the past are constrained by institutional routines, and may have resources that allow them to operate in counterproductive insulation from the environment. As leaders persist, they form bonds among themselves, develop common understandings of how things work, and select others like themselves to lead. Access to internal organizational resources can insulate them, in the short run, from environmental change. For a time, these resources may even give them the power to shape that environment  but only for a time. Changes in organizational structure that reduce leaders accountability to or need to mobilize resources from constituents  or changes in deliberative processes that suppress dissent  can diminish strategic capacity, even as resources grow. The strategic capacity of an organization can thus grow over time if it adjusts its leadership team to reflect environmental change, multiplies deliberative venues, remains accountable to salient constituencies, and derives resources from them. (Ganz, 2003)\r\n\r\nAs Ganz and others note, there is a need for permeable organizations that are flexible, contain built in reality checks and are able to accommodate and reward innovative thinking (Thomas, 2002, Tresser, 2002, Wortley, 2002, Michaelson, 2002, Brown, 2006 and Dutfield, 2006). Working with groups and constituents outside of the institution provide leadership with unique opportunities to adjust their goals and priorities. Providing appropriate reward structures for those within and outside of the institution provides the opportunity for building new relationships and collaborative development. Being able to respond to these changes and opportunities in a timely and appropriate manner requires a special team comprised of partners in development.', 'Institutions should begin to:\r\n* develop innovative and sustainable relationships with remote and rural communities that are built upon the principles of trust, sharing, respect and strength to ensure an equitable and fair existence for all to support a sustainable, transformative institutional model. \r\n* establish a transformative change within their environments to engage as well as effectively communicate and share with the region their products and resources. The resulting exchange becomes a model for cooperative and collaborative development across regions and elsewhere, as innovative strategies and creativity benefiting all become entrenched and commonplace in all relationships. \r\n* Create flexible institutional management models that can adjust to the changing and evolving needs of people so everyone has the opportunity to become engaged in these transformative efforts.', NULL, 398, 763, '2006-10-26 18:02:47', '2006-10-29 20:01:31', NULL, NULL, 'Keewaytinook Okimakanak', NULL, 303, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Yet, the world changes so that what was true is no longer true and what was once irrelevant becomes important, even vital.   Further, even with respect to things that do not objectively change, new knowledge is continually created.  It is natural for students to identify with good teachers and to value their knowledge highly.  A possible side-effect of this basically good process, however, is that the student may become reluctant to go against the teaching of their mentor/hero/professor.  This reluctance occurs, not just with respect to individual teachers, but also with respect to the society as a whole.', 'The world is changing rapidly and critically.  For example, the human population has literally exploded in the last few hundred years.  The consumption of fossil fuels continues basically unabated despite the signs of global warming and the finite nature of these fuels.  The incredibly destructive nature of modern weaponry means that fights for limited economic resources or over restrictive and doctrainaire religions can produce unprecedented levels of human misery.  Yet, many individuals, groups, and societies seem just as conservative and rigid as ever.', 'Living organisms have existed on earth for at least 10**9 years while modern human institutions like government have only been around for about 10**4 years.  Living organisms all have the capacity to change with each new generation both through mutation and re-combination.  We would do well to emulate what has worked.  \r\n\r\nThe United States Consititution, although a best efforts work at the time it was created, also carries within it, provision for change through Amendment and many of these have been critical to the broadening of American democracy to a wider range of citizens. \r\n\r\nThe Walking People (Underwood, 1997) describes the journey of one branch of the Iroquois Tribe over several millenia.  In the process, they were forced to learn to accomodate to different physical and cultural situations.  They developed numerous mechanisms both for retaining learned wisdom and for challenging and changing when new situations arose. \r\n\r\nThe need for challenge and change has probably never been greater.  Nonetheless, there are many mechanisms that tend to prevent change.  At the individual level, change can be uncomfortable.  Typically, a targeted change in one area or domain also has unintended consequences not only in that same area or domain but in others as well.  If an individual changes, this may require compensatory changes in those close to the individual.  Thus, there is often resistance to change at the level of family and friends as well.  Furthermore, there is often institutional resistance to change.  Institutions, including corporations, work to keep any and all advantages that they already enjoy.  Governments and religions also often work to keep the status quo.  \r\n\r\nGiven the numerous levels at which resistance to change occurs, it is necessary to have active mechanisms that work toward change.  The impacts of change need to be carefully evaluated however because not all changes, even well-intentioned ones work well.', 'In order to help prevent stagnation of knowledge,  one useful strategy is for the teacher, as an integral part of their teaching, to teach transgression; that is, to go against the received wisdom --- to test and rebel against it.

(230, 220, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Economic globalization is repainting the face of international trade.  World trading has mushroomed into an unfair economic trend separating the developed and under-developed worlds. Around the globe, production, trade and retailing of most goods and services are increasingly concentrated under the control of a small number of corporations.  To offset the steaming engine of this powerful global economic force fair trade associations made up of fair trade wholesalers, retailers, producers and consumers are needed  to foster a more equitable and sustainable system of production and trade that benefits people and their communities.', 'Fair trade means that trading partnerships are based on reciprocal benefits and mutual respect; that prices paid to producers reflect the work they do; that workers have the right to organize; that national health, safety, and wage laws are enforced; and that products are environmentally sustainable and conserve natural resources.1  ', 'Backed by conventional economists, large corporations have convinced most of the world\'s governments that they should maximize global competitiveness through freer trade. Corporate and government officials often theorize that free trade will be beneficial for workers, whose wages and benefits can rise as foreign markets expand for their goods and for consumers who can buy cheap foreign imports. Following this theory, new regional trade agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are reducing barriers to trade and investment for firms. These free trade agreements offer firms global protection for their intellectual and property rights but there are currently no equivalent enforceable global standards to protect workers and the environment. Furthermore, as barriers to entering local markets are removed, large scale manufacturers edge small businesses and local cooperative enterprises out of the market. Local economies suffer when these firms\' profits are channeled out of the country rather than being reinvested locally. (FTF, 2006)\r\n\r\nAs a result of these trends, the gap between the rich and the poor has increased dramatically in recent decades. The benefits of trade are similarly concentrated among the wealthiest segments of the world\'s population and only a handful of developing countries. Even in many countries that are currently experiencing high growth rates from expanded trade, the benefits of growth are not trickling down to the poor. (FTF, 2006)\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the bulk of exports from developing countries tends to be in primary product commodities, such as sugar, cocoa, coffee, etc., whose prices generally rise much more slowly than the prices of manufactured goods imports. Free trade agreements do little to enhance the trading positions and commodity prices of these poor countries. In many cases, the world market price for commodities such as coffee and cocoa falls below the cost of production, forcing farmers to sustain huge losses. Fair Trade organizations offer a crucial alternative by paying farmers a price that always covers at least production costs. \r\n\r\nDeregulation allows corporations to benefit at the expense of the people in a nation or region with the relaxation of environmental rules, health and educational services including control of natural resources and energy. (Wikipedia, 2006)  Meanwhile subsidies in developed countries allow producers to sell their products at discounted prices and make it difficult for producers in developing countries to compete in the global market place. Protectionism issues such as unreasonably high tariffs restrict developing countries from exporting their products to developed countries. \r\n\r\nMarket prices do not reflect the true costs of producing products because external economic factors like environmental and social costs are not figured into production costs.  Fluctuations in commodity prices make it difficut for producers in developing countries to maintain a living wage, forcing them into debt.  Marginalized workers and producers work from a position of economic vulnerability and insecurity.  Unethical labor practices such as gender inequality, child labor, and sweatshop practices contribute to unfair profits.\r\n \r\nEquitable trade relations need to be established between governments, non-governmental organizations, multi-national corporations, and international institutions that promote the principles and practices endorsed by alternative free trade organizations. Fairtrade advocates and associations support trading relationships by creating opportunities for economically disadvantaged producers. Fair trade is a strategy for poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Its purpose is to create opportunities for producers who have been economically disadvantaged or marginalized by the conventional trading system. Fair trade involves transparent management and commercial relations to deal fairly and respectfully with trading partners. Fair trade promotes transparency and accountability throughout the business operation. Fair trade helps build capacity as producers develop their own independence. Fair trade relationships provide continuity, during which producers and their marketing organizations can improve their management skills and their access to new markets.  (Wikipedia, 2006)\r\n\r\nPayment of a fair price in the regional or local context should be agreed through dialogue and participation. It covers not only the costs of production but enables production which is socially just and environmentally sound.  Fair trade actively encourages better environmental practices and the application of responsible methods of production.  Fairtraders ensure prompt payment to their partners and, whenever possible, help producers with access to pre-harvest or pre-production financing.  \r\n\r\nFair trade provides fair pay to the producers and takes into account the principle of equal pay for equal work by women and men.  Fair trade means that womens work is properly valued and rewarded. Women are always paid for their contribution to the production process and are empowered in their organizations. Fair trade means a safe and healthy working environment for producers.  Worker safety and environmental protection are pursued diligently.  The participation of children (if any) does not adversely affect their well-being, security, educational requirements and need for play and conforms to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as the law and norms in the local context. (Wikipedia, 2006)\r\n\r\nThe idea of labeling fairly traded products needs to be expanded into a more widely used standard in business.  The easiest way to support Fair Trade is to purchase fairly traded products. Your actions as a consumer support or discourage actions by businesses, even large corporations.  Even small acts like purchasing a cup of coffee from a business that is fair trade certified help move the world economy in a more positive direction.', 'Adhering to social criteria and environmental principles can foster a more equitable and sustainable system of production and trade that benefits people at the local level.  Small as it may be the rapidly growing fair trade movement is setting standards that could redefine world trade to include more social and environmental considerations. Fair traders believe that their system of trade, based on respect for workers\' rights and the environment, if adopted by the big players in the global economy, can play a big part in reversing the growing inequities and environmental degradation that have accompanied the growth in world trade.

(231, 221, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Human welfare depends on using the Earths physical resources, material cycles, and biological processes, but present human techniques, understanding, decision-making, and perceptions of need are profoundly blind to their destructive effects on these essential functions of the Earth. The reverse is also a problem: present attempts to protect the Earth are often blind to how they impact human welfare.', 'This pattern addresses people whose work involves direct or indirect interactions with the environment, i.e. with Earth\'s regenerative systems of all kinds.', 'It is not news that Earth\'s environment is under assault at all scales, from the planetary (global warming, overfishing, ozone depletion, and the like) to the local (toxic waste sites, extinction of rare species, oil spills, and so on) and everywhere in between. Nor is it news that all of these assaults are intimately entwined with the welfare of human groups or even whole populations. Whether or not evil masterminds are making the basic decisions (probably negligence is much more often to blame than malevolence), present-day industry and agriculture, together with present modes of finance and organization, do provide the framework for billions of people to engage in livelihood, child-rearing, recreation, even spirituality. This framework cannot be simply abolished without great suffering.  \r\n\r\nFortunately, the three decades since the first Earth Day have seen the linking of a mode of thinkingdesignand a set of valuessustainabilityto seek new ways of building, making products, and providing utilities and services with reduced or no destructive effects on the planet.  Examples of this sustainable design include the \"living machine\" concept for sewage treatment, \"green roofs\" of soil and plants, and passive solar techniques for managing indoor temperatures.\r\n\r\nIn a green roof, hardy plants in a layer of soil form the first surface between the weather and the building. Underneath is an impervious layer which does the rest of the waterproofing and keeps roots from growing down into the building. Like a conventional, inorganic roof, this assembly protects the building interior from the elements, but it is better in some important ways. The presence of a large planted surface softens the buildings appearance, and brings nature much closer to hand. Evaporation from plants and soil keeps the roof much cooler in summer than normal surfaces, which benefits building occupants and reduces the heat island effect for the surrounding town. The planted layer also protects the impervious surface from solar ultraviolet light and swings of temperature, so it lasts longer. \r\n\r\nIn green roofs, one has a particularly clear case of sustainable design. The direct environmental effects, on energy, urban air quality, longer life of materials and the like are positive, and intangible effects such as contact with nature go in good directions, as well. Simultaneously, human welfare, at least as understood by the occupants of buildings, is also supported. Sustainability, as a set of values, accepts human purposes and an inevitable degree of human impact on the rest of nature, even while it hopes to minimize destruction and pollution. Sustainability is a compromise between environmentalism and economic development. \r\n\r\nDesign enters the picture because sustainability has never been conceived in terms that are both concrete and applicable everywhere, and it probably cannot be. The range of environmental and human situations across the planet is too wide, and each situation has too many delicately related variables for any general formula to apply. The discussion of sustainability has identified topics of attention, such as energy, toxic emissions, local production, and resource equity, but it can only voice ideals, not definite rules. To express sustainability in a specific time and place, one needs a mode of thinking which can synthesize general values like sustainability with local constraints and opportunities. Design is just such a mode. (See the DESIGN STANCE pattern for more on this point.)\r\n\r\nSustainable design is much like conventional design, but sustainable values replace novelty, fashion, and mastery of nature as priorities. There are also several important new emphases. Sustainable design is much more open to community involvement than the conventional expert-centered design approach, and it assumes that older traditional practices can contribute much to present designs. Finding ways to synthesize expert knowledge and community wisdom, and bring together traditional and innovative methods are active areas of experiment and investigation. \r\nSustainable design needs to be integrative in brand-new ways, because such a wide range of of environmental and human values in each project needs attention. Whereas an architect could previously draw a form and instruct engineers to find a way to build it and heat it, with everyone relying on cheap energy and industrial materials to permit a solution, sustainable design usually needs to be a team effort from the start, allowing a mutual influence of energy, materials, form, and other considerations. As a simple example, solar energy in the U.S. calls for southern orientation, while good access from roads at a given location may call strongly for northern. Sustainable design does not place one of these values automatically higher than the other: the right integration for the project and its users has to be worked out each time, with relevant voices represented from the beginning.\r\n\r\nTaking nature seriously also guides the time perspective of sustainable design. Whereas architects or engineers have often conceived their work as timeless and independent of Natures processes, the sustainable designer understands the work as an intervention in the natural flows of the planet. It creates impacts, but also receives them. Even heroic engineering, like the New Orleans system of levees, cannot defy Nature indefinitely. And even the most profitable (or most humanitarian) project of the present can inflict enormous costs on the planet, including its people, in the future. Sustainable design does not regard the future as superior to the present, but it regards it as the involuntary heir to what happens now, for good or ill.', 'Consider each building or product as a double interventionin the Earths cycles and processes, and simultaneously in the human culture of needs and techniques. Make use of available understanding, both innovative and traditional, both natural and social, to gauge the proper balance of human and non-human effects for each intervention. Remember that present culture builds from the work of the past, and future culture will have to build from what the present provides. The ethic of sustainable design is not only that future existence should be possible, but that it should exhibit justice and beauty for humans and for the rest of nature.', NULL, 798, 783, '2006-10-26 18:01:25', '2006-10-25 18:42:32', NULL, NULL, 'Evergreen State College', NULL, 360, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Efforts toward creating a desirable society continue to be hindered by unquestioned privilege, fear, and prejudice across race, caste, and ethnic divisions.', 'There are few cultures in the world that have not been affected in some way by European concepts of race. In some cases, European colonizers layered ', 'This pattern has two major dimensions: Anti-Racist Awareness and Anti-racist Action. \r\n\r\nAwareness begins with seeking a deeper understanding of the multiple ways that racism and race privilege operate in the lives of individuals and organizations.  Anti-racist books, movies, workshops, lectures, discussions, and observation can all be useful tools for raising awareness.  Multi-cultural history books (e.g., \"A Different Mirror\") or social/economic analysis (e.g., \"Black Wealth White Wealth\") can help us see beyond the myth of the melting pot, and understand how social structures maintain racial inequity generation after generation.  Films like \"Banking on Life and Debt\" help us understand the international forces that maintain global inequalities built upon European Colonialism, and how those inequities reinforce domestic racism.  Reflective essays like \"White Privilege and Male Privilege\" can help us see how privileges are bestowed upon whites on a daily basis, even when they do not seek racial advantage. \r\n\r\nBy analyzing social and historical dynamics of power and privilege, we understand why few people reach adulthood without internalizing social hierarchies that shape our unconscious perceptions of one another.  At the same time it is important to become more aware of the possibilities for change and resistance. We must learn about the successes of communities of color that have struggled against racism, and we must learn about inter-racial solidarity that has aided anti-racist efforts at numerous times and places in history. \r\n\r\nArmed with a better awareness of the dynamics of racism, members of an organization can become more reflective about their own practices.  Developing and maintaining an anti-racist consciousness is an on-going process for most people, but it is especially challenging for members of dominant racial groups. Because information and communication represented in the dominant culture are likely to reinforce the racial status quo, whites in the U.S., for example, must take extra care to seek the perspectives of people of color who are critical of mainstream policy, discourse, and ideology. \r\n\r\nAction begins with recognition that we are not powerless in the face of institutionalized or interpersonal racism, and that challenging racism is both an individual and collective responsibility. Examples of anti-racist action are plentiful --from individuals interrupting racist jokes to transnational organizations uniting against contemporary colonialism.  \r\nAn anti-racist orientation can help guide many facets of an organization: out-reach practices, service providing, hiring, resource allocation, group communication, etc. With an anti-racist perspective, individuals can work to create organizations that both embrace ethnic diversity and model a commitment to racial justice. Organizations whose members are primarily from privileged communities can seek guidance from leaders that represent grassroots organizations in other communities. Groups can form alliances across racial or national boundaries making shared use of differing access to information, experiential knowledge, economic resources, and political power. \r\n\r\nOrganizations can promote anti-racist solidarity by investigating the racial dimensions of any issues that they are working on. For example, anti-racist environmentalists have exposed the disproportionate effects of toxic waste on communities of color. Information technology activists interested in racial justice have designed projects to accomodate differing needs in differing ethnic communities. Within the anti-war and anti-globalization movements, activists with an anti-racist orientation have drawn attention to the role that racist discourse and ideology play in maintaining public support for international policy. \r\n\r\nThe greatest challenge to anti-racism is the discomfort, defensiveness, and animosity that it often engenders among whites (or other racially privileged groupsdepending on the context).  Rejection often happens when individuals from privileged groups do not see themselves as responsible, in any way, for the conditions that other racial groups experience. Talking about race privilege and unconscious racial biases can seriously threaten peoples positive sense of self. Many people are more comfortable believing that innate characteristics of racial groups cause the problems or successes that each groups experience, and some people even perceive themselves to be discriminated against when members of other racial groups demand social change to alleviate injustices. Whites who are economically disadvantaged, (or who experience discrimination related to age, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability, or other characteristic), sometimes see anti-racism as a denial of their own hardships.  In extreme cases, oppressed whites may react so negatively to anti-racist critiques that they turn toward white supremacist or neo-nationalist ideologies to shore-up their low self-esteem (see Paul Gilroy for a critique of British anti-racist education of working class youth).  People of color also sometimes oppose anti-racist perspectives when they have been convinced by the dominant culture that racism is no longer a significant, institutionalized problem. For people of color, becoming more aware of racism can be particularly painful and disempowering.\r\n\r\nIn order to be successful, anti-racists must recognize the strength of dominant racial attitudes and ideology. Anti-racist education and discourse should be geared toward the forms of denial and dismissal that are most common in a particular context.  Educational activities should include follow-up support to help people process new, sometimes disturbing, ways of seeing the world.  Resources that put a human face on the experience of racial oppression can be particularly useful.  Focusing on the shared costs of racism (and the shared benefits of ending it) may be the best way to encourage inter-racial solidarity. When both whites and people of color recognize that ending racism is in their interests, they begin to see themselves as part of the long history of resistance to racism.  This sense of solidarity across time and  racial boundaries adds meaning and a sense of hope to the difficult, and sometimes emotionally painful, process of recognizing and challenging race privilege and racism.', 'Only by recognizing racism (personal and institutional) and actively challenging it, can we hope to overcome the racial divisions that inhibit effective problem solving and weaken progressive movements.  An anti-racist orientation to social change can help organizations successfully challenge policies and practices that mask power, exploitation, and resource grabbing behind the guise of liberal individualism and national interests.', NULL, 769, 786, '2006-10-26 18:02:09', '2006-10-25 18:54:23', NULL, NULL, 'TESC', NULL, 313, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Grounding ones public engagement in this way can lead to productive and insightful action but such efforts are often highly charged. Contemporary societies and communities vary widely in how well they receive such initiatives -- a martyr to one group will seem like a dangerous radical to the opposition. Intermingling politics and religion can taint both, leading to false pieties in politics and making mundane the prayers and rituals which were originally spiritual in purpose.', 'Groups and individuals seeking to structure social agendas have to create a sense of their purpose, and spiritual convictions often offer constructive guidance. Activists can find allies in the public debate by framing their position in religious terms. Personal resilience can be sustained by strong religious belief.\r\nConstitutional separations between Church and State in North America and Europe are decidedly ambiguous about whether and how particular congregations should participate in public affairs. Other societies, notably those Muslim ones which base their law and the state itself on religious dogma, can find secular ethical criteria offensive. Furthermore, activism motivated by religion is often denounced as extremist by those whose motivations are strongly secular.', 'This pattern is illustrated by a series of historical examples intended to suggest its scope. The possibilities are many and varied. Read these stories while remembering that secular organizing can be just as powerful, legitimate and insightful.\r\n\r\nGandhi practiced and advocated \"Ahimsa,\" the non-violent struggle for truth, inspiring an his part of the anti-colonist movement to center on that strategy. Derived from Hindu tradition, Ahimsa applied to all features of their lives, from confrontations with the British to the ways they lived and ate and worked together. Martin Luther King, working within the Christian tradition, was able to find the religious inspiration for a similar approach to non-violence in the US Civil Rights movement. Thich Nhat Hanh andhis fellow Buddhist monks used self-suffering in the Ghandian tradition to oppose the war in Vietnam. All three movements followed a religious injunction against doing violence, although in each it was recognized that they themselves might die. The strategy continues in use at the state level in the struggle between Tibetans under the leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government.\r\n\r\nFor centuries Catholic nuns, monks and brothers have been engaged in providing health care, hospitality and basic succor to the poor and needy. In recent years that work gained world wide recognition as a result of Mother Theresas order in India. Their practice, like the non-violence movement is both a strategic imperative and an injunction for the activists to live a certain way, in this case sharing poverty and privation with those whom they help.\r\n\r\nFor the last 50 years, womens reproductive systems and rights have been at the center of a wide range of conflicts. Papal Encyclicals and local health center policies are alike in their ability to stimulate confrontations about contraception and abortion. In parts of Africa, religious traditions have been the basis for both challenges to and support for female \"genital mutilation\" or \"circumcision\" as it is called, depending on ones perspective. Religion, life and birth have always been linked. The relationships between medicine and religion have become quite uneasy, as much at the end of life as at the beginning.\r\n\r\nDebt and monetary interest payments mark another area where religions have guided and inspired action on the global scale. The Christian notion of Jubilee provided the doctrinal basis for groups around the globe to press the largest banks and richest nations to support debt relief for poorer nations in the Jubilee 2000 campaign. Meanwhile, working from the Buddhist perspective, writers and activists have begun to reconfigure the definition of wealth and materialism.\r\n\r\nSacred environmentalism is well rooted as well, both in the United States and around the world. Connected in the US to the Transcendentalists of the nineteenth century, this movement has found a responsive reaction in many areas since place and sacred experience are so often linked.\r\n\r\nAt their best, religious practices serve not only to shape the mission, but also to guide organizational behavior. Silent retreat or a prayer meeting -- either can offer respite from the mundane. Singing together, marching together, sitting quietly in Quaker meeting together -- all of these can strengthen the sense of community. Charitable giving, cooking for the poor, visiting prisoners -- all of these can feel like religious practices when inspired by a spiritually grounded activism. Priests, Imams and other religious leaders offering blessings over an action, can ease the qualms and concerns of their followers. In all these ways, organizational resilience gains support from adherence to a religious or spiritual path. Marshall Ganz reminds us to see religion \"not only as a source of understanding about what was right - but also as a source of the solidarity, willingness to sacrifice, anger at injustice, and courage, and leadership to take action - in other words, not only of moral understanding but the capacity to act on that understanding. Or, as St. Augustine said, not only of \"knowing the good\", but also of \"loving it\" enough to act on it. \"\r\n\r\nThe stories in this pattern were chosen to illustrate constructive work undertaken by adherents in a variety of traditions. These same traditions have of course often been the basis for cruel, intolerant and self-righteous oppression, government and justice.\r\n\r\nThis pattern links to Sense of Struggle, Witnessing', 'Remember the hymns and prayers of the American Civil Rights Movement, which exemplify ways that a healing religious practice can build solidarity among activists while holding them to laudable ethical standards. The injunctions embedded in this pattern are: by all means ground your own work in the values, the mysteries and the heritage of a religious community. At the same time, hesitate to judge others whose motives and practices are different. If secular values justify and guide your actions assume the best of those driven to act by religious convictions and likewise, if you are religious, give credence to the secular. In either case remember that ritual, whether sacred or secular, can strengthen bonds among organizers and provide them with the respite necessary to keeping on with the work of change.', NULL, 784, 829, '2006-10-26 18:01:35', '2006-10-25 19:06:21', NULL, NULL, 'The Evergreen State College', NULL, 338, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

One word for what they offer is Cyberpowerpower in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of this word can be understood in comparison to another useful word: e-commerce.  E-commerce is a word that summed up what businesses, coders and consumers were doing.  On the basis of that summation, many more people were guided in that direction, and e-commerce became more advanced as a result.  Millions are now buying and selling online, with the goods delivered in the real world.  Our experience with the word cyberpower is the much same: the word came into use based on practice; then it mobilized more people to exercise their cyberpower.

Recent calls for a dialogue of civilizations, starting with the United Nations (1998), rather than a clash of civilizations (Huntington 1998) could be taking part online, but only if everyone can see, hear, and speak in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet well understood, but communities in crisisbe it from poverty, disaster, war or some other adversityare known to turn to technology for response and recovery.  Cellphones, impromptu cybercafés, the Internet, all helped in the Gulf hurricane recovery.  Farmers on quarantined farms quickly mastered home Internet use during Englands foot-and-mouth-disease outbreak.  The US armed forces now strategize in terms of land, sea, air, and cyberspace.  Immigrants all over the world have created digital diasporas. (Miller and Slater 2000)  Whatever language people use to describe it, cyberpower is the driver in all these cases.\r\n\r\nHiphop can be seen as a technology-based response to crisis and a cyberpower project.  In a community-based seminar, we proposed to create a CD of original raps about IT.  Students and community members were skepticalone said, We dont know anything about computersbut all the music making was digital, the tools were put together in bedrooms and basements, and the result was a compilation of 15 tracks.

The sale, planned for March 2002, was discovered online, then thousands protested online and the sale was stopped.  The process began when monitoring eBay for items related to Malcolm X, we discovered that eBays auction house, Butterfields, was about to sell thousands of pages of Malcolms diaries and notes, recovered from a storage locker, for an expected price of $500,000.  Using the listserv H-Afro-Am, this news was spread across multiple communities of scholars, librarians, activists, and others.  The American Library Association then created a story on their online news site which is fed to more sites and individuals.  The next day The New York Times did a story.  On the third day The Guardian newspaper ran a story about the impending sale and the online groundswell against it.  The listservs and the news articles alerted the family and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library, who wre able to negotiate the postponing of the sale, then its cancellation.  An agreement was negotiated with the seller whereby the materials are now in the possession of the family, housed at the Schomburgs archives.  In sum, the important historical papers (actual) were being auctioned (virtual); thousands of people were mobilized (virtual); traditional media carried the story (virtual and actual); and ultimately the materials were withdrawn from sale and placed intact in a public library archive for scholars and the public (actual).\r\n\r\nAnother example of cyberpower is told by Mele (1999).  Faced with a teardown of their housing project, tenants in Wilmington, Nouth Carolina wrangled the key to a long-locked community room, internet access for the lone computer (actual), and via email and listservs (virtual) recruited architects and planners to help them obtain, digest and answer developer and city plans.  They won an actual seat at the negotiating table and, more important, key changes to the teardown plan that included interim and long-term housing for residents.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of new tools for exercising cyberpower are in wide usage at this writing, for example, MySpace, blogs, wikis, and the online video festival known as YouTube.  Use of any of these tools locates you in a lively community.  The idea from Putnam (2000) that were bowling alone, not connecting with other people in an atomized world, is, as Lin (2001) asserted, trumped by the fact that we are not computing alone.', 'Cyberpower means two related activities related to empowerment: 1) individuals, groups and organizations using digital tools for their own goals, or 2) using digital tools as part of community organizing.

Modern environmental challenges are often difficult to see, distant in time and space from their sources, and threaten global consequences. The increasing complexity and chronic rather than acute nature of today\'s environmental problems requires a revolution of decisionmaking  the systematic integration of earths vital signs.', 'Signals detected by scientists about earth\'s natural patterns and processes and the impacts of humans on these processes are earth\'s signs - indicators of what can be seen as either ecological health or the capacity of the earth to accommodate human demands. The conditions of earth\'s systems tend to be worsening on a global scale, but vary dramatically from place to place. Human decisions about how to live on earth drive these trends and can potentially reverse their negative directions.\r\n\r\nPolicymakers, public interest organizations, universities, and governments can utilize earth\'s signs to better manage human and environmental well-being. Policymakers\' decisions about sustainable practices in land- and resource-dependent sectors can be backed by scientific understanding about the effects of policies on resources. Citizens can demand better environmental stewardship from their leaders at local to global scales with improved access to and translation of relevant earth information at the proper scale. Governments and enforcement bodies can strengthen their monitoring capabilities and base development decisions on the latest information about trends in human impacts on earth.', 'Three distinct approaches to integrating earth\'s vital signs come from the scientific community, public interest organizations, and enforcement bodies.\r\n\r\nScientific institutions can collaborate to reach audiences in need of earth-related information to solve problems. The work of earth observation agencies to collect and disseminate data and images to important users like humanitarian aid agencies provides one example. Disaster prevention, response, and rebuilding are information-intensive. This fact is illustrated time and time again in the wake of natural disasters. For example, in Asia in 2005, an immediate need emerged in tsunami-affected areas for earth observation and environmental data to help in assessing damage, reaching victims and rebuilding resilient communities. In response to this need, an alliance of European and International organizations is working with the humanitarian community to improve access to maps, satellite imagery and geographic information (The CGIAR-CSI Data Sharing Platform). This kind of effort by the scientific community to ensure that information actually comes back \'down to earth\' opens a host of possibilities for more sustainable decisionmaking if scientists in other fields can repeat it. Scientists from communities researching water, pollution and future risks from global warming could create similar initiatives to ensure the information that they gather becomes integrated in decisionmaking in water-scarce areas, in clean water and air policies, and for promoting climate change adaptation in development strategies, to name a few.\r\n\r\nAnother way earths signs are integrated into decisionmaking is by concerned public interest groups and universities gathering, translating and communicating trends that reflect environmental sustainability to motivate improved environmental governance. The outcomes of resource and land management policies such as energy, fisheries, forests, water, urban planning and rural development can be extrapolated from existing environmental data. A key challenge however, is translating scientific information to connect to the public and policymakers. In examples from around the world, organizations locate data reflecting the condition of impacted resources, create indicators of stewardship or sustainability from these data, and translate their findings into insightful measurements, models and maps that are publicly available and understandable to broader audiences. Clarifying the connections between political and business decisions and environmental outcomes can promote environmentally sustainable decisions and reverse negative trends if decisionmakers are held accountable to these indicators. Scorecards of environmental performance (Environmental Performance Index), policy-wise ecological assessments (Hudson River Foundation), and regional indicators and indices of sustainability (Cascadia Scorecard) have the potential to become a systematic part of policymaking if leaders are held accountable for their performance on these measures of earth\'s vital signs. Currently, information is not available at the right scales and frequently enough for such assessments to be carried in every context, but an increase in reporting has been proven to stimulate better information gathering.\r\n\r\nEarth monitoring information has also been used by enforcement agencies, environmental organizations, and governments to improve accountability for the environmental impacts of business practices. Satellite imagery and other sources of management practices can be used to monitor natural resources on public lands, in protected areas, human settlements, etc. One example comes from an initiative in Central Africas Congo Basin, an important wood products exporting region to Europe (Global Forest Watch). European procurement standards are the highest in the world, and buyers often demand legally and sustainably harvested wood from their suppliers. A system to monitor the legality and sustainability of forestry operations has emerged that utilizes satellite imagery, tracking whether harvested areas conform to legally-agreed boundaries and harvest rates. By making the findings publicly accessible, consumers use the information in procurement decisions and market pressure can promote better management by companies. Similar innovative applications of earth information can capitalize on market forces and encourage sustainable resource management if public concern is tangible.', 'Integrating earth\'s signs throughout decisionmaking requires that environmental information is widely available, connections between management practices and environmental outcomes are understood, environmental implications of policies are translated to the public and policymakers, and that the environmental performance of governments and companies is publicly disseminated. Replication of existing initiatives and further innovations can help to ensure that decisionmaking balances human impacts with the health of the planet.', NULL, 506, 742, '2006-10-26 18:02:37', '2006-10-25 19:12:48', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 315, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Many detriments to health cannot be eradicated without changes to the physical and social world that people inhabit.

Health discrepancies between rich and poor will not be solved through better access to information alone. Good food, less stress, clean air and water, and a life with a purpose will increase health and healthy behaviors. Real change to improve health comes from a shift away from acknowledging only expert clinical opinion and toward a real-world awareness of the effect of environment on health: a shift from passive diagnosis and treatment to active engagement with the causes of and solutions to health problems.', 'We are not, for the most part, born unhealthy. We become unhealthy. And even for those born unhealthy, a great deal of ill health may have been preventable. The campaign to find the cure for breast cancer is a good example of health information that neglects any causal connection between ill-health and the environment (in this instance, an environment which includes the use of estrogen in prescription medication), and ignores political or social change that might address environmental causes of the disease. This pattern of information, in which action comes only after the individual becomes ill but nothing has been done to prevent illness in first place, focuses on individual responsibility with no questioning of the established social order. The unspoken message is that breast cancer just happens. It is up to the individual to get involved with a screening program for early detection and treatment. Information on research that investigates environmental effects to the development of breast cancer is not part of mainstream health information.\r\n\r\nPublic health information about diabetes further illustrates the lack of emphasis on the connection between environment and health. Among Native Americans, diabetes (like most other non-infectious chronic diseases) was virtually unknown before World War II. Now, in some tribes, over 60% of adults have diabetes and the age of onset is decreasing with each generation. Much of the research on diabetes among Native Americans focuses on genetic causes or on molecular level differentiations of diabetic types. It gives short shrift to how the disruption in traditional diet and life style and the devaluation of traditional medicine correspond with the dramatic increase in the disease. The connection of indigenous people to the environment that they come from, the types of foods they eat, and activities they perform to prepare those foods are not considered an active component in their health. Diabetic health information focuses on what the individual can do to access mainstream diets and medicine. It does not validate traditional knowledge that prevented diabetes in the past, and ignores how the community as a whole can work together to recreate that knowledge. This does not mean trying to reestablish life as it was 60 years ago, but it does mean putting the current problem in a holistic context that includes history, indigenous knowledge, the interaction between diet and environment, and reasons for lack of access even to non-traditional healthy food.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, John Snow removed the handle from a London neighborhood water pump that was located a few feet from a sewer (\"John Snow Pub,\" 2006). He believed that this sewage was causing the epidemic of cholera deaths in the neighborhood. Epidemiology textbooks emphasize Snow\'s connection of cause and effect as the first public health intervention of the modern era. They ignore an analysis of cause: industrialization and dislocation, poverty, over-crowding etc. What options for water did people in the neighborhood have without the pump? Seldom mentioned is that, due to the demand of a thirsty public, the handle was replaced six weeks after its removal.\r\n\r\nPublic health programs must include methods to share power with communities they hope to help. What are the contributors to ill health in their communities? What are the barriers to good health that the communities identify? Information needs to realistically address what is within the control of the individual and what will take groups of people working together to solve. Methods to improve health in disadvantaged communities must reflect the larger social change and shift in power needed.\r\n\r\nHealth information such as Fast Food Nation (Schlosser, 2002) needs to be the norm, not the exception. This book chronicles the entire environment that produces fast food, including social norms and values. Similarly, the documentary film Life and Debt (www.lifeanddebt.org) shows the destruction of healthy, local food production in Jamaica by the combination of multinational food businesses and international government policy.\r\n\r\nHealth information needs to do more than simply inform. What does not question the present state of affairs will not, for example, bring affordable nutritious food to poor neighborhoods. Nor will it create safe neighborhoods in areas where children cannot exercise. Better access to information may improve health care decisions to some extent; unless it also generates momentum and optimism for social change then it simply perpetuates a focus on individual behavior and treatment of symptoms that have already occurred. Health information needs to look honestly at the conditions that cause ill health, and engage not only those who suffer illness but the entire social and regulatory apparatus that can play a role in improving the conditions that people live in.', 'Demand and produce health information that identifies environmental and social causes of ill-health.

If people had a better idea what the entire \"cost\" of their actions were &mdash;  not just their own personal costs at that moment &mdash; there is a higher likelihood that they\'d change their behavior to encourage positive changes and discourage negative ones.', 'People in developed countries are always buying &mdash; things &mdash; often from developing countries &mdash; and are generally unaware of the legacy of the product. People may be morally opposed, for example, to the child labor that went into, say, a pair of athletic shoes, yet they implicitly condone the practice with their purchase. The one economic point of view holds is that the whole cost should be reflected in the price tag, but this is rarely possible.  Many of the costs are impossible to put a number on, and they may even differ from the point of view of different people.  (What is the \"true\" cost of taking away a wetland used by geese on their migration?)  So the pattern includes in some sense the common economic understanding but goes beyond it.  All people need to live consciously in this world.', 'In an increasingly globalized world people are connected to each other in ways that are often unknown to each other. One of the main ways that people in developed countries and less developed countries are linked is through products. When a person in a developed country buys clothing, consumer electronics, or other items all the buyer sees is a purchase price. Missing, of course, is the entire chain of lineage that was effectuated in order to place that product within purchasing range and  its enduring effects on the environment  has been dispatched of. Often the price on the product obscures a sordid legacy that could include child labor, environmental abuse such as pesticides in ground water, air pollution or soil depletion, or aspects that are harder to quantify like migration of youth to the urban areas or loss of cultural heritage. \r\n\r\nOne of the basic uses of this pattern is understanding the \"whole cost\" of an object or a service that one is purchasing. Ultimately the intent of this pattern is identifying the whole cost of something and using the information (that a single price obscures) to promote broader public consciousness and ultimately improved social good. There are a great number of ways that the information can be used &mdash; and a great number of ways left to be discovered. Ideally the information behind the price tag will take on greater significance while the price tag itself can also be made to reflect the previously hidden information more accurately including, for example, labeling that tag to include additional information about contents or relevant environmental effects or labor practices. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the \"whole cost is primarily a process of education that can be done individually (by people of virtually any age) or in more public ways through any number of ways. This \"understanding\" can be via a narrative or story or it can be more quantified, including, for example, information about who got paid how much for what at every step in the chain.  One approach is using the origin of the product as an indicator; not buying a product, for example, if it were made by non-union, child, or slave labor or because it was produced by a repressive regime.\r\n\r\nA more nuanced process with a distinctively quantitative feel is illustrated by the work done by the International Center for Technology Assessment in their \"The Real Price of Oil\" report (1998). In that report based on gasoline prices from a U.S. perspective, the authors reveal how ultimately deceptive the idea of the \"price at the pump\" actually is to the actual monetary cost expressed in a specific currency, dollars, for example. And while their approach, like other economically based approaches, ignores (or, at least, re-interprets) the human story, it goes a long way towards developing (and ultimately using) a unitary \"price\" as a meaningful attachment to a commodity or service thats available for purchase. In the case of gasoline, the authors show how multiple government subsidies (huge tax breaks, direct support for research development and other business costs, and \"protection subsidies\" often of a military nature) and a multitude of \"externalities\" (problems as diverse as air pollution, automobile crashes, suburban sprawl and climate change that are \"costs\" which the oil industry is not going to address and are not reflected in any way by the price one pays \"at the pump\") result in a public price-tag for gasoline that distorts the real price by 5 to 15 times. The \"free\" television programming that occupy so much of the time of the U.S. citizenry shows another perversion of the ideas of price and costs. The shows of course are not \"free\" at all &mdash; at least not to the viewers (and non-viewers) who pay for the ads every time they purchase something thats advertised on television. \r\n\r\nA simple use of the information (at least in the gasoline case above) would be eliminate or otherwise lower the government subsidies &mdash; especially the ones that actually hurt the environment and lead to wars and other problems and let the price creep (leap?) up to the actual price (or at least closer to it). This at the least would test the citizenrys commitment to the automobile in a fair comparison with competing approaches to transportation. A related approach is of course un-externalizing the externalities by bringing the costs back home to the companies that are making them possible. This can be done by imposing a \"green tax\" on the companies, which would be used to help try to reverse the damage caused by the companys business practices. Unfortunately, as Peter Dorman explains There is a general distrust of the effectiveness of government, a fear that green taxes will be more regressive than some of our current ones.  The alternative is the creation of environmental trusts, which would collect the money on behalf of the beneficiaries, which could include current people, future people and natural entities.  The trust would pay back some of the money directly (per capita rebates) and also finance ecological conversion.  Vermont and Massachusetts are in the process of setting up a trust of this sort for carbon and New York and California are possibly going this route too. \r\n\r\nThe city of San Francisco recently showed another innovative use of the Whole Cost concept. In the spring of 2005, San Francisco became the first city in the U.S. to enact legislation requiring the city to consider the environmental and health implications when making purchases for the city. Since the city spends about $600 million every year on a multitude of purchases (including, for example, 87,000 fluorescent light tubes) this type of legislation could conceivably have some effect, especially since city officials are hoping that the \"Environmentally Preferable Purchasing for Commodities Ordinance\" will serve as model for other cities. The city is working with community groups, technical experts and other city staff to establish criteria. Debbie Raphael, the city\'s toxics reduction program manager, stated that \"Traditionally, we have a list of specifications we use to decide which computer to buy,\" she said. \"Those specifications do not include things like how much lead is in them? Can you recycle them? What is their energy use? What it does not mean is that cost and performance is ignored. We\'re expanding the universe of criteria\"  (Gordon, 2005). \r\n\r\nA final use of the Whole Cost pattern is to consider the Whole Cost in more of a global \"whole\" way. Looking just in this the area of health reveals the importance of this approach. In a short article called \"The Price of Life\" by Glennerster, Kremer, and Williams (2005) point out that Africa \"generates less than one half of one percent of sales by global pharmaceutical firms but accounts for nearly 25 percent of the world\'s disease burden.\" The lion\'s share of pharmaceutical research and development is for the health problems of rich countries. Sadly the economic equations of the world\'s corporations exclude the vast majority of world\'s population. Lacking money, the \"whole costs\" that are borne by them don\'t show up on anybody\'s balance sheet or business plan.', 'The first thing to realize is that the price one sees on a price tag is rarely the \"Whole Cost.\" The second thing to realize is that the Whole Cost of a good or service is educational as well as inspirational. People have been very innovative in this area but there is room for much more. It\'s important to publicize the \"whole cost\" of a product as well as the monetary price.  This could include what percentage of the monetary price goes to worker and other costs to the environment, quality of life, and other important factors.', NULL, 85, 412, '2006-12-11 10:12:56', '2006-12-11 10:12:13', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Although this is only one measure among hundreds or thousands of other possible measurements it is judged to be important enough &mdash; and acquired easily enough &mdash; to be warrant its acquisition. An <i>indicator</i> is typically a single measure that can be acquired over time to help ascertain the general health or condition of a larger, more complex entity, like a lake, city, or society. It helps serve by being a stand-in or proxy for that whole.\r\n\r\nIndicators are often devised and used by scientists, economists and other professionals to help inform them on the status of what\'s important to them. And just as the medical community has selected temperature as one indicator among many possibilities, these professionals have selected theirs. And, like other measurements, these can have far-reaching consequences which basically depend on they\'re interpreted, what meaning is ascribed to them, and what\'s done with them. Needless to say, communities &mdash; especially those that are struggling to stay alive &mdash; generally play no direct role in the development of these indicators, nor do they design their own. \r\n\r\nIn 1991, a group of social activists in Seattle launched an ambitious multiyear project around the idea of sustainability. Though many people today view sustainability as largely an environmental paradigm, it is one that can capture the long-term cultural, economic, civic, and educational health and vitality of a region as well. Because sustainability is a complex term and difficult to define and comprehend, the first goal was the development of a set of \"critical indicators of sustainability\" that would assist in defining the term and defining Seattles current status. \r\n\r\nSince that time the project has matured into a community-wide program divided evenly into research and community action. One commendable aspect of their effort has been the patient, evolving, consensus-driven manner in which the project has taken shape and unfolded over time without being driven by set agendas.\r\n\r\nWhen the project was launched, the \"indicators of sustainability\" were designed to form its intellectual as well as motivational foundation. Indicators are measurable values that accurately reflect and coalesce several factors that are deemed to be important. The selection of indicators as core constructs of the endeavor demonstrates the founders commitment to a long-term rather than a quick-fix effort, for it is only by examining how the values of the indicators change over time that an understanding of trends can arise. Examining changes over time may also bring to light relationships between indicators. Two indicators, for example, may actually bear inverse relationships to each other. \r\n\r\nWhen people in the community identify indicators that are important to them, the indicators are more liable to carry personal and operational meaning than when social scientists in an ivory tower identify theoretical constructs that are significant only to an academic community. The indicators are carefully chosen to reflect activity within a community that is desired or not desired by that community. Furthermore, because the community identified the indicators, there is a feeling of ownership and confidence in them.\r\n\r\nWhile Sustainable Seattles report on Seattles critical indicators presents a useful snapshot of several important aspects on the communitys agenda, it does not by itself create a sustainable society. According to their newsletter (Sustainable Seattle, 1994), \". . . understanding trends in our community is only the first step in the journey towards sustainability. The next step is to change the community.\" To that end, Sustainable Seattle initiated a Communities Outreach Project \"to create measurable improvements in the behaviors and practices that drive the indicators, both on large and small scales, as a result of homes and organizations changing their behavior in response to this project.\" Their ambitious goal \"is to enable and inspire people in the many different communities in greater Seattle to transform the values of sustainability into actions that will move Seattle, the region, and the planet towards long-term cultural, economic, and environmental health and vitality.\"\r\n\r\nThe Worldwatch Institute identified and assessed 50 social, economic, and environmental trends which they labeled the Earth\'s \"vital signs\" to help show the important role consumers can play in demanding environmentally friendly products. .Indicators can also be used in international or other large-scale collaborative projects. A new international effort between the US and Canada that monitors the health of Puget Sound Georgia Basin where salmon and orcas are endangered in Washington state and in the province of British Columbia shows another use of indicators (Stiffler, 2006).  Of the nine indicators  that the project has established five of them are declining (Urbanization and Forest Change; River, Stream and Lake Quality; Marine Species at Risk; Toxics in Harbor Seals; and Marine Water Quality) while the remaining four have not shown progress (Population Health; Solid Waste and Recycling, Shellfish; and Air Quality). Scott Redman from the US team stated that the indicator project \"puts press then for us to catch up, or the other way around.\" There is a web site that includes data as well as a large number of suggestions for people and groups who want to help improve the situation. \r\n\r\nThe Bulletin of Atomic Scientists through its \"Doomsday Clock\" offers a variant on this concept. The clock measures the state of worldwide nuclear danger (not just from a US perspective) and graphically reports its findings in a clock whose hands are approaching midnight &mdash; nuclear apocalypse. Moving the hands is not taken lightly, \"Because the Doomsday Clock is the worlds most visible symbol of nuclear danger, any decision to reset it is taken with great care and only after significant deliberation by the Bulletins board of directors, in consultation with the board of sponsors.\" It is interesting to note the infrequency within which the clock has been reset: 17 times in 56 years. The two boards reset the hands infrequently to demonstrate significant developments; the clock does not respond, \"to every change in the global security environment. If it did, it would be in almost constant motion and would lose much if not all of its symbolic resonance. \"\r\n\r\nMany of the patterns in this pattern language &mdash; including this one &mdash; could be used as indicator generators.  What indicators, for example, could  be used to show whether humankind\'s Civic Intelligence is increasing or decreasing? Virtually any area, conceptual or actual, could be a source of indicators. And in any area, it will be important to think of what possible actions could comes after the indicators are developed <i>before</i> they\'re identified. What to do with information? Who could use the information?  What resonance could the information have with various people and groups?\r\n\r\nIntroductory illustration is from <a href=\"http://www.hudsonriver.org/\">http://www.hudsonriver.org/.</a>', 'Citizens need to construct community and civic indicators, publish them, discuss them, measure them, publicize them and develop policy and projects that address them.

In addition to the manic novelty, the stories offer little real information, especially about alternatives or opportunities for public involvement. Even the \"news\" is entertainment. In the US (and other places) the \"market\" is credited / blamed for \"giving the people what they want.\" Thus while television and other commercial media stupefies people, the owners merely shrug their shoulders and say that they\'re just giving people what they want. This turns out often to be grisly murders, cheesy voyeurism, celebrity romance (or, better, divorce), and advertisements, advertisements, advertisements. In less \"free\" societies, the governing elites make all decisions about what is news  and guess what  governmental misdeeds aren\'t news. Who decides what issues are important, what issues are on the public agenda?', 'If the public agenda is simply the set of issues that people happen to have in their heads at any given time then we can say that a \"public agenda\" exists. If the public agenda consists of issues that ought to be considered in a public way, particularly how does society use our limited resources and what is truly important, then the public agenda is a far cry from it could be.', 'During a 1999 interview on the local Seattle public radio affiliate, a woman who was involved in the demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle was asked \"why it was necessary to break glass\" to get the issues on the public agenda. She first mentioned that she and her colleagues had been trying unsuccessfully to get these issues on the public agenda for a decade and that she was opposed to using violence against people or property. She went on to say, however, that one couldn\'t help but notice that after windows were smashed in Seattle the media, pundits and others seemed to acknowledge the issues more readily &mdash; at least for a week or so. Hence we make the argument here that <i>\"It shouldn\'t be necessary to break glass\"</i> for citizens and citizen groups to get a public airing for the issues that they feel are important. \r\n\r\nWhere do the \"pictures in our heads\" (Lippman, 1921) and the issues that we\'re contemplating at the moment come from? Certainly we are all \"free\" to come up with something that\'s all our own but this is not likely to be commonplace. When we see something, something else in our mind is triggered. We may interpret the information in our particular way but the new information is the driver &mdash; not something else. At any rate, it\'s not the idiosyncratic and disconnected thought that\'s important, it\'s the focused, diverse, engaged and thoughtful <i>collective</i> mind that democracy requires. The sounds and the images that the big electronic billboard, always there and always on, holds aloft for the world to view will obviously garner more attention (\"mind share\") than something with less visibility &mdash; which, of course, is everything else. The press as Bernard Cohen points out, \"may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling it\'s readers what to think about\" \r\n\r\nMaxwell McCombs\' and Donald Shaw\'s paper on \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media\" (1972) brought the notion that the mass media is instrumental to agenda-setting to prominence. This paper demonstrated that the public\'s answers to the perennial Gallup Poll question \"What is the most important problem facing this country today?\" could be predicted quite clearly by looking at the news as presented by the newspapers, network television news, and news magazines that were available at that time in the month prior to the poll. In a more recent paper, McCombs reported that since the original article, \"more than 300 published studies worldwide have documented this influence of the news media.\" \r\n\r\nNow, some 35 years after the original publication, the media landscape has changed considerably. People (at least in the U.S.) have more choices and many apparently \"choose\" to be ill-informed. The mass media with its collage of seemingly random information about movie start divorces, dog food, genocide, game shows, laugh tracks, mass starvation, cell phones, climate change, \"shock jocks\", trailer fires, bus plunges, talking heads, celebrity chit-chat, invasions may be actually doing more to muddle than to inform. \r\n\r\nThe Internet, however, is currently providing an interesting challenge to the hegemony of the mass media. Community networks and Indymedia showed glimpses that other  ways of producing and consuming news were possible. The explosion of blogs of every type is the latest salvo along these lines. In fact, as of the end of the 2003, 2/3 of the blogs were political (Delwiche, 2005). The blogging phenomenon suggests many things including the blurring of the division between producers and consumers of journalism and the continuing fragmentation of journalism roles and venues. Some of the more interesting questions, recently explored by Aaron Delwiche (2005), are whether the blogs are &mdash; or can be &mdash; agenda-setters in their own right and whether they can serve as a tonic and an alternative to their mass-produced forbearers.\r\n\r\nIt would be naive to think the mass media will provide citizens with the information that they need without pressure from the citizenry. They\'ll say first that their first responsibility is their stockholders. We must remember that just because something is mentioned in the mass media doesn\'t mean that it\'s irrelevant and vapid. Although the previous statement was made with tongue in cheek, there is certainly a danger (as well as a temptation) to disregard all mass media. The realization that traditional (mass) media is ready and willing (and generally capable) of diverting attention from the important to the superfluous is a significant first step but it\'s just a start. Monitoring the media systems, constructing a broad and compelling alternative agenda must be an ongoing enterprise.', 'We need to think about what belongs on the public agenda and what we can do to put it there and keep it there.

The basic idea is that the Social Forums, like parties or conferences or other gatherings, provide an occasion for people of similar interests to get together. What people choose to do with the information is ultimately a decision that they will make. But, by the same token, the forums do what they can to make the events successful in the sense of spawning collaborative and collective actions and projects <i>without</i> heavy-handed \"social engineering.\" The Big Tent pattern encourages other smaller tents (with, for example, regional or thematic focus) to form within the event and these \"smaller tents\" can ultimately provide issue and geographical \"space\" to support the work of additional groups with other forums.   \r\n\r\nThe big tent scale of the World Social Forum and the growth (starting with 20,000 in 2001 and up to 100,000 in 2005) has helped foster respect from mainstream media and other entities that may be seen as oppositional to the Forum principles, as it demonstrates that this is real, and there are large numbers of people and organizations that are committed to working on these issues.  Another positive attribute of this pattern of a large gathering of many social issue groups for mobilization is that the scale is big enough that individuals can participate and be somewhat anonymous, which can reduce the pressure to represent a certain group ideology and allow more freedom to express alternatives, to listen and to learn.\r\n\r\nConceived as an counterforce to the elite World Economic Forum held annually in Davos, Switzerland, the World Social Forum picks up where the 1999 demonstrations against the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle left off by providing the setting for activists to create alternatives to corporate dominance.  The economic agenda was not the only issue discussed at the World Social Forum when it was held in Mumbai, India in 2004. Government repression (in Burma, for example) was examined in workshops and demonstrations as was discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation or caste. The presence of Dalits, the \"untouchables\" at the bottom of India\'s elaborate (and technically illegal) caste system, was a reminder that basic human rights are far from universal. Regional issues like so-called \"honor killings\" and dowry practices were also discussed as were the rights of children. Jabala, a group that works with children in red light districts led a rally with the chant: \"Aloo becho, machchi becho, par bachchon ko mat becho\" (\"sell potatoes, sell fish but don\'t sell children\"). Thousands of children are inducted into the sex industry every year.\r\n\r\nThroughout the four day gathering, labor groups, human rights advocates, antiwar campaigners and many others conducted boisterous processions accompanied by dancing, sign-brandishing, and drumming. Along with rallies, films, and photography exhibits, delegates had organized scores of workshops, seminars, information sharing sessions and debates. Delegates from over 130 countries discussed strategies, areas of mutual concerns and opportunities for collaborations based on newly discovered linkages between issues. \r\nWe have used the World Social Forum as the main example of this pattern because it is the most prominent meeting of this type in the world. It has shown itself to be replicable &mdash; at least so far &mdash; in its totality as a <i>World</i> Social Forum, but, also, in a variety of constituent regional and thematic fora. Although not all \"big tents\" are required to adopt the tenets of the World Social Forum, two of its principles may be useful if you are considering the idea of convening Big Tent events.\r\n\r\nThe first principle is that the Forum is an \"open meeting place\" or agora where issues are <i>raised</i>, not necessarily deliberated or used to directly plan actions. The second principle is that power is not intended to reside within the organizational structure of the WSF. The governing body of the WSF, for example, is prohibited from making statements in the name of the WSF. Also, the original \"Charter of Principles states that  the WSF \"does not constitute a locus of power to be disputed by  participants in its meetings.\" While both of these ideas are designed to forestall certain problems, they ironically raise other types of challenges or tensions within the WSF community. One of these is related to action vs. talk orientation, with the action-oriented people saying that after seven years it is now time for an action agenda. Another objection is related to participation vs. elitism. Although most events are organized by participants, some plenary events are generally convened and these are likely to populated by \"star\" activists. \r\n\r\nOne certainly has a better understanding of the enormity of the world\'s problems after attending a \"big tent\" event like the World Social Forum. On the other hand, one cannot help but feel some cautious optimism as well. Airing the problems of the world with dedicated people who are working to create \"another world\" is a necessary step in the solution of these problems.', 'Bringing groups together in a big tent where a multiplicity of perspectives is encouraged allows more opportunities for discussion of solutions to social problems and sharing of ideas that help other groups working on the same or similar issues.', NULL, 385, 815, '2006-10-28 15:26:53', '2006-10-28 10:49:01', 'The Evergreen State College', NULL, 'The Evergreen State College', NULL, 289, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

It describes a potential \"contract\" between an offering entity and a person looking for future possibilities.  Opportunities, of course, take many forms.  These can include classes and seminars, volunteer positions, jobs, contests, access to the media, timely announcements, mentoring, scholarships, grants and many others. \r\n\r\nOpportunities dictate the possible paths to the future that are available to people. Hence the opportunities that society ofers is of critical importance.  What opportunities exist?  Do they exist for all citizens or just privileged ones?  How are these opportunities developed?  Do people know about them?  In many cases, spending a little more effort making  the existing opportunities more widely known will help considerably.\r\n\r\nThere are often mismatches in a society between the opportunities that exist for individuals and opportunities that individuals <em>believe</em> exist for them.

According to Marshall Ganz, the person who developed the concept of this pattern,  it is most useful in \" turbulent environments where rules, resources, and interests are  emergent and links between ends and means are uncertain.\"', 'Discerning the macro tides of history is a risky business. Fortunately for those who undertake this avocation, those attempting the readings of the tea leaves writ large, have generally been quite dead years before the evidence emerges that demonstrates the unforeseen flaws in their reasoning. (Or, in rare cases, vindicates their astonishingly spot-on observations.)  Perhaps riskier is the business of responding purposefully, punctually, piercingly and resoundingly to the micro tides of the here and now; the unexpected opportunities that arise from nowhere and vanish as rapidly. The best responses often demonstrate a shocking disregard for conventional wisdom. They will often demonstrate a preternatural anticipation of the next event and the next even after that and so on &#150; while everyone else is seemingly caught unaware.\r\n\r\nIn the early 60\'s Marshall Ganz set aside his undergraduate studies at Harvard to work within the Civil Rights Movement in the US South. Twenty-eight years later, Ganz returned to Harvard, finished his Ba. and PhD., and developed the concept that this pattern is based on. \"Strategic Capacity\" specifically focuses on the question of <I>why</I> and <I>how</I> some people and organizations happen to adapt so wisely and, often, \"guilefully\", to new circumstances.  (Indeed, some appear to thrive on them!) Strategic Capacity is too elusive to yield to mechanical analytical probes.  For one thing, as Ganz points out, we can observe, \"choices about targeting, timing, and tactics\" (2004) but \"the strategy that frames these choices &#150; and provides them with their coherence &#150;  must often be inferred, using data drawn from interviews with participants, oral histories,  correspondence, memoirs, charters, constitutions, organizational journals, activity reports,  minutes of meetings, and participant observation.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that a specific strategy can probably be understood after the fact, the general strategic capacity of an organization\'s or movement\'s resistance to analysis is undoubtedly part of its power.  Thus Ganz focuses more on the conditions that engender successful strategizing within an individual or group (i.e. its \"strategic capacity\") than on the strategies themselves.  (Of course how a strategy is put into action is not trivial!) Ideally a group will  use its strategic capacity to simultaneously build its strength while accomplishing its objectives.\r\n\r\nGanz explains that decisions are expressions of strategy and that strategy is a type of <i>group</i> creative thinking or <I>distributed cognition</I> that is sometimes akin to the \"performance of a jazz ensemble.\"  His theory of Strategic Capacity uses <I>motivation,</i> <i>access to salient knowledge,</i> and the <I>heuristic processes</I> that organizational leaders use as the key factors behind effective strategic capacity. Motivation is important because it describes how willing the group is to work towards its goals and what types of goals are established in the first place. Ganz further states that motivation based on \"intrinsic rewards\" and on the moral meaning of the enterprise is very important. Access to salient knowledge is important because, without this knowledge &#150; particularly knowledge about \"resources and opportunities,\" the group would be using inadequate and misleading information that the group asses and interprets to make its decisions in the heuristic processes, the third constituent of strategic capacity.\r\n\r\nGanz then steps back to consider the two driving forces, <I>leadership</I> and <I>organization</I>, that will be employing the strategic capacity that the model describes.  According to Ganz, \"Leaders devise strategy in interaction with their environments.\" He stresses that leadership teams are more likely to have effective strategic capacity when they include \"insiders\" and \"outsiders\", have strong and weak \"ties\" (connections) to a variety of sociocultural networks, and have \"knowledge of diverse collective action repertoires.\" On the organization side, Ganz points out that, \"Leaders interact with their environment from within organizational structures.\" Leadership teams that are regularly involved in open deliberations with actionable outcomes have more strategic capacity, and leadership teams that rely more on people than money are cultivating sustainable strategic capacity by encouraging leaders who can effectively strategize.', 'A group or organization that makes good decisions will be more effective than one that doesn\'t. Marshall Ganz\'s concept of \"Strategic Capacity\" identifies the underlying attributes behind a group\'s ability to make these decisions. By improving these attributes, a group can likely improve its ability to make good &#150; and, sometimes, suprisingly good &#150; decisions. Based on Ganz\'s reading (2004) of Bruner (1990), \"Strategic thinking is reflexive and imaginative,  based on ways leaders learn to reflect on the past, attend to the present, and anticipate the future.\"', NULL, 503, 463, '2006-02-13 15:59:49', '2006-09-29 08:00:00', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(244, 234, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Bias free media may be impossible.  For that reason people need to be able to identify and assess media bias. Some have argued that media has become so vivid, so real that people can live in them. Media literacy is the process of decoding and making sense of all media. It allows us to critically view media and to evaluate the role that media play in our lives. When someone is media literate, he or she has the skills to identify the ideological implications and manipulative means of media systems and practices.  Unfortunately, exposure to media does not necessarily suggest that people have the critical skills to understand how media systems work or how they are relating to media messages.  Further, there is very little training in media education.  In most places in the world, public education resists the changing media environments.  Also, teachers are not given specific instruction in the workings of media, nor are they trained in the methods of media practices.  Of course, it must be mentioned that in some places in the world, media has a foothold in the curriculum of public education but rarely does this curriculum come with the pedagogical training educators need to reach their audiences.  The study of media has developed into complex systems of understanding, analysis, and synthesis.  Yet, media study is not thought of within the context of traditional academic disciplines. As a result, we live in a world where ubiquitous media messages, without critical appraisal impact our world.', 'Masterman, in particular, stresses the student\'s development of \"critical autonomy\" as a primary objective of media education.  In Teaching the Media, he argues that the key task of media teachers is to \"develop in pupils enough self-confidence and critical maturity to be able to apply critical judgments to media texts which they will encounter in the future\" (24).  Thus, the primary objective of media education is not simply to foster critical awareness and understanding, but to develop a student\'s awareness of his or her role as an active agent when engaged by all media, no matter the context. The \"critical autonomy\" approach to media education differs from its predecessors in three ways.  First, the pedagogical practices of this approach stress investigative strategies; that is, teaching and learning are emphatically student centered and inquiry oriented.  Second, the process of making meaning through critical investigation is emphasized; that is, strategies of decoding are stressed within pedagogy.  And third, visual literacy and media literacy, rather than an exclusively \"print-oriented\" literacy, function as the criteria for evaluation of student work.', 'Until very recently if somebody complained about the media, the typical response was to \"turn off the TV.\" Suddenly it has become commonplace to think of media not as an autonomous system but as an important element in a cultural environment that, like the physical environment, needs to be monitored for degradation and corruption. We need to be able to recognize biases and other problems that we encounter with existing media systems. All messages are made with some sense of the people receiving them.  People filter these messages based on their beliefs, values, attitudes, behaviors, and past experiences. Every media message is communicated for a reason  to entertain, to inform, and usually to persuade. Behind every message is a purpose and point of view. The advertisers purpose is more direct than a program producers, though both may seek to entertain. Understanding their purposes and knowing whose point of view is being expressed and why is crucial to being media literate. Yet the basic motive behind most media programs is profit through practices like the sale of advertising space and sponsorships. These reasons are also important to consider because all media messages are owned. They are designed to yield results, provide profits, and pay for themselves. All news and entertainment programming, including film and television, try to increase their audiences to attract advertising dollars. Understanding the profit motive is key to analyzing media messages. Messages are communicated through the use of elements like sound, video, text, and photography.  But most messages are enhanced by the use of visual and technical elements through camera angles, special effects, editing, or music. Analyzing how these features are used in any given message is critical to understanding how that message attempts to persuade, entertain, or inform. Because messages are limited in both time and purpose, rarely are all the details provided. Identifying the issues, topics, and perspectives that are not included can often reveal a great deal about the purposes of media messages. Because media messages tell only part of the story and different media have unique production features, it helps to evaluate multiple messages on the same issue. This allows you to identify multiple points of view, some of which may be missing in any single message or medium.\r\n\r\nThese are but some of the issues to be discussed when considering the problems and challenges associated with the term media literacy.  Other approaches include concerns about monitoring ownership and the political economy of these systems in the global economy, about interpretation, evaluation and critique of media messages, about knowledge of how media impact and influence, and about how to address the changing needs of a world where media constantly evolves. \r\n\r\nA critical autonomy approach to media education addresses these concerns within an educational context.  As part of the school reform movement of the past decade, media education scholarship assumes a student centered pedagogical practice in which the student is viewed as an active, aware participant in learning, a lifelong learner, and a self-motivated and self-directed problem solver.  This image of the learner is an essential consideration not only in the design of media education, but also within the larger pedagogical frame in which the curriculum is negotiated.  According to Boomer (1992), negotiating the curriculum means deliberately planning to invite students to contribute to, and to modify, the educational program, so that they will have a real investment both in the learning journey and in the outcomes.  Negotiation also means making explicit, and then confronting, the constraints of the learning context and the non-negotiable requirements that apply.  (14) Masterman argues further that \"if students are to understand media texts . . . then it will obviously be helpful if they have first-hand experience of the construction process from the inside\" (26).  To this end, media education includes media production, what Masterman dubs \"practical work,\" as a pedagogical practice which enables students to create media products.  Thus, students are actively engaged both with the production of media and the workings of the classroom.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of their interest in student centered learning, scholars of media education aim to develop curricula which consider the forms and practices of education and of pedagogy.  Curricula which are inquiry oriented tend to offer activities which stress critical strategies, and pedagogy centers around the creation of a dialogue -- i.e., not just discussion, but the kind of talk that leads to dialectical thinking.  In this context, divergent readings of texts are positively valued for their potential to stimulate further analysis and thus growth in understanding. The aim of media education is to encouraged a heightened self-consciousness about the processes of interpretation and meaning making and provide people with an opportunity to recognize that everyone uses a selective and interpretive process to examine media texts.  This process and the meanings obtained depend on psychological, social, cultural, and environmental factors.  In this view, then, media education strives to enable people to understand how media texts come to have a range of meanings or readings ascribed to them, and to develop even richer, more critical readings. \r\n\r\nContemporary media educators are also beginning to challenge traditional notions of literacy.  Literacy, by definition, refers to the ability to read and write.  But scholars insist that there are \"languages\" other than print, such as those related to the mass media, which also need to be considered within the definition of \"literacy.\"  Visual literacy, for example, has been described by Messaris (1994) as \"greater experience in the workings of visual media coupled with a heightened conscious awareness of those workings\" (2).  And Masterman has argued that since both print and visual literacy involve \"the deconstruction of texts by breaking through their surface to reveal the rhetorical techniques through which meanings are produced\" (127), any education for \"literacy\" should focus on that process, rather than on the symbolic form of a particular set of \"texts.\"', 'Education and educational practices need to shift to address the changing media environments. We need to perform more public media criticism. We need to engage with media more closely to keep them in check and to be informed as to how we are responding and why. We need to be more serious about our media environments and foster greater awareness of the impact and influence media systems have on daily life. We must arm all people with the knowledge, skills, and values a media education program provides  granting people access to new technology and information about its workings and ideological implication. Finally, we need more alternative communication systems to counter these problems.', NULL, 173, 411, '2006-08-14 15:01:24', '2006-09-15 09:50:34', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 345, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The problems range from the inconvenient (in setting an alarm on an unfamiliar alarm clock, for example) to the dangerous (an inadequately marked pedestrian crosswalk or scalding water from the tap when cold was expected). And in the design of groupware, software systems that facilitate group collaboration, developers can create systems that embed users in a system like cogs in a machine where a more human-centered system that was more humane  and more effective  could be developed.', 'This pattern is intended to be used in any situation in which a service, policy, or other artifact is being designed. Those who will use the artifact and those who will be affected by it should be included in the design process.', '<blockquote><i>\"The very fact of exclusion from participation is a subtle form of suppression. It gives individuals no opportunity to reflect and decide upon what\'s good for them. Others who are supposed to be wiser and who in any case have more power decide the question for them and also decide the methods and means by which subjects may arrive at the enjoyment of what is good for them. This form of coercion and suppression is more subtle and more effective than are overt intimidation and restraint. When it is habitual and embodied in social institutions, it seems the normal and natural state of affairs.\"</i> &mdash; John Dewey (1939)</blockquote>\r\nThis \"subtle form of suppression\" that Dewey identified in the quotation above shows up in sociotechnological systems and in various arenas including the workplace. Without genuine participation in the design process, class, managerial, or other privileges become designed in. That is, sociotechnological systems often carry forward the perquisites and propensities of the designers, intentionally or unwittingly. Cases abound in both cases. Robert Moses, New York City\'s \"construction coordinator,\" ensured that the bridges over the highways leading to the beaches from New York City were low enough to prevent buses from traveling under them (Caro 1975). This ensured that African Americans and other minorities who often had to rely on public transportation would, in large measure, be confined to the city while the more financially well-to-do could periodically escape to the seaside. There was no need to pass laws when a permanent physical structure could silently and invisibly enforce the color bar Moses preferred.\r\n\r\nFrustrated by what they saw as unresponsiveness of software and the impending institutionalization of management prerogatives into software systems, Scandinavian researchers in the late 1970s conceived a new paradigm for software development called participatory design in which end-users worked as co-designers of the systems that they would ultimately use. They believed that adopting a participatory design approach would result in systems that better served users, initially workers in industrial settings. According to PD researchers Finn Kensing and  Jeanette Blomberg (1998), \"At the center of the critique was the neglect of workers interests  those most affected by the introduction of new technology. PD researchers argued that computers were becoming yet another tool of management to exercise control over the workforce and that these new technologies were not being introduced to improve working conditions (see e.g. Sandberg, 1979; Kyng and Mathiassen, 1982).  The Scandinavian researchers and workers also worked on the legislative front to establish \"codetermination\" laws in Scandinavia that ensured that workers had the right to be involved with technological decisions in the workplace (Sandberg et al 1992). They promoted user empowerment through education and \"researchers developed courses, gave lectures, and supervised project work where technology and organizational issues were explored (see e.g. Kyng and Mathiassen, 1982)\" (Kensing & Blomberg 1988).\r\n\r\nParticipatory design is an integration of three interdisciplinary concerns that span research and practice: \"the politics of design; the nature of participation; and method, tools and techniques for participation\" (Kensing & Blomberg 1998). In their paper, \"Participatory Design: Issues and Concerns,\" Finn Kensing and Jeanette Blomberg discuss two primary aspects to this work.\r\n\r\n\"Increasingly, ethnographically-inspired fieldwork techniques are being integrated with more traditional PD techniques (Blomberg et al., 1996; Bødker, 1996; Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1997, Kensing et al., forthcoming). The primary techniques of ethnography include open ended (contextual) interviews and (participant) observations, often supported by audio or video recordings. These techniques are employed to gain insights into unarticulated aspects of the work and to develop shared views on the work. \r\n\r\n Complementing these tools and techniques for work analysis are those focusing on system design such as scenarios, mock-ups, simulations of the relation between work and technology, future workshops, design games, case-based prototyping,  and cooperative prototyping (Kensing, 1987; Ehn, 1989; Greenbaum and Kyng, 1991; Trigg et al., 1991; Mogensen, 1992, 1994; Blomberg et al., 1996; Grønbæk et al., 1997). These tools and techniques avoid the overly abstract representations of traditional design approaches and allow workers and designers to more easily experiment with various design possibilities in cost effective ways.\"\r\n\r\nThe nature of participatory design has changed over time. In the software world, for example, the focus has shifted from the development of site-specific software systems to the design of web applications and, perhaps more importantly, to the entirety of the information and communication infrastructure, including policy development. The idea shows up in many guises and even open source communities could be considered a type of participatory design.\r\n\r\nParticipatory design has been advocated in a number of areas besides software. Architects Lucien Kroll (1987), John Habraken (1972), Christopher Alexander (1984), Michael Pyatok (2000) and others developed a number of techniques for allowing people to design their own working and living spaces. Artist Suzi Gablick, writing in The Reenchantment of Art (1992_) describes a number of ways that the creation of art could be more participatory, while many others are advocating participatory approaches to media, policy development, citizen participation journalism (Gillmor 2004). \r\n\r\nSeveral books, including The Design of Work Oriented Computer Artifacts (Ehn, 1988), Participatory Design: Principles and Practices (Schuler and Namioka 1993) and Design at Work (Greenbaum and Kyng) helped provide some early guides for the use of participatory design of software and the biannual Participatory Design Conference sponsored by Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility helps to foster its continued evolution. \r\n\r\nParticipatory design is not a panacea. People may not want to participate; in many cases they quite plausibly determine that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Participatory design can certainly be time-consuming and higher quality of the end product cannot be guaranteed. Participatory design projects can go awry in a number of ways (as do traditional and more orthodox software development efforts.) Software users using mental models based on the software are accustomed to using may enter a design session believing that they have already fully designed the system (down to the last key-stroke short-cut). Because of this possibility (and others reasons), many PD approaches focus on fairly general high-level exercises that are fairly far removed both conceptually and physically from computers. \r\n\r\nIn some cases, a participation trap may be said to exist. This could happen when people are being brought into an effort that will ultimately make matters worse for them. In cases like this a less cooperative, more confrontational approach may be more likely to bring satisfactory results. Participation gives rise to several issues that probably must be resolved on a case-by-case basis in practice. Potential participants understand this instinctively. If, for example, the participative arena is for show only, and no idea that originates with a participant has any chance of being adopted, people can\'t be faulted for being dubious of the process. Genuine participation should be voluntary and honest; the relevant information, rules, constraints, and roles of all stakeholders should be well-understood by all. (A person may still decide to participate even if any and all benefits would accrue to the organizers.) Ideally, the participants would be part of any decision-making, including when to meet, how to conduct the meetings, and other processes. Kensing (1983) and Clement and Van den Besselaar (1993) describe several requirements for effective PD.\r\n\r\nPD principles, techniques, and methodologies will continue to improve and be better known over time. PD will likely continue to involve bricolage, the ability of the participants and the people organizing the process to improvise. Unfortunately, as Kensing and Blomberg (1998) point out, building on the work of Clement and Van den Besselaar (1993), \"the experimental nature of most PD projects often leads to small-scale projects which are isolated from other parts of the organization.\" (See Eevi Beck\'s \"P is for Political\" for more insight on this important observation.) The best way for the process to continue to improve is to build on successes and create incrementally a culture of participation on the job and in society, that is both equitable and effective at designing systems, services, tools, and technologies whose design better meets the real demands and needs of the people.', 'There should be a strong effort to include the users of any designed system (software, information and communication systems, administrative services and processes, art, city plans, architecture, education, governance, and others) into its design process in an open, authentic, and uncoerced fashion. Participatory Design, according to Finn and Blomberg, has made no attempt to demarcate a category of work called cooperative, but instead has focused on developing cooperative strategies for system design PD is not defined by the type of work supported, nor by the technologies developed, but instead by a commitment to worker participation in design and an effort to rebalance the power relations between users and technical experts and between workers and managers. As such PD research has an explicit organizational and political change agenda. (See Eevi Beck\'s \"P is for Political\" for more insight on this important observation.)', NULL, 298, 861, '2006-11-20 13:28:05', '2008-10-17 20:33:30', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

(246, 236, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'The role of science in the modern world will become increasingly critical in the years ahead, as health care, energy, resources and the global environment become ever more problematic. Science can appear to serve powerful institutions, such as stock markets and the weapons industry, more that it serves the people most affected by these problems. Meanwhile, the resources of society\'s professional scientists are overtaxed by the amount of data to be collected and the need to distribute expertise over a wide area. Science needs greater participation from people at large, and people need a greater voice in science.', 'Science is a human activity. Whether studying the physical world or society itself, it has tangible effects on society. Scientific knowledge is provisional, subject to revision. The scientific profession is inseparable from society as a whole; science requires funding and regulation, contributes expertise to official inquiries and investigations, and creates technological and social changes that affect us all. Citizen groups and individuals experience the benefits, hazards and missed opportunities of scientific development in the real world, not in the laboratory.', 'Citizen Science has been with us for a long time. Since 1900, the Audubon Society has organized volunteers throughout the US to count birds at Christmastime and used their data to build a huge database of early winter bird populations (History & Objectives, 2004). This is a clear-cut instance of Citizen Science as a partnership between the public and professional scientists (Citizen Science, 2003, para. 3); people benefit from learning about birds, the Society benefits from information it would otherwise lack the resources to obtain, and birds benefit from researchers knowledge of which species require special attention (Citizen Science, 2005).\r\n\r\nOur relationship with science is not always so simple. Mistrust exists in public perceptions of science as offering scientific solutions to complex social problems, furthering various forms of social and environmental depredation, and inappropriately claiming certainty in judgments about risks associated with scientific and technological developments (Irwin, 1995). The drug industrys investment in treatments seeking diseases of the rich (Blech, 2006), for example, undermines the view of scientific development as open-minded, skeptical and independent of institutional constraints (Irwin, 1995, p. 109). Agents of public policy, too, can contribute to popular mistrust, though supposedly representing the public interest. For example, the 1977 Windscale Inquiry was less democratic decision-making than keeping up appearances of public participation in a decision that had already been made (Irwin, 1995). \r\n\r\nAt the same time, science has cause to be wary of the public; in the US, for example, the proportion of people overtly accepting the idea of evolution has dropped from 45% to 40% since 1985 (Miller, Scott & Okamoto, 2006). Popular media have a stake in public mistrust of science because they stand to profit from science-related scare stories (Cassidy, 2006).\r\n\r\nWhat scientists learn under controlled conditions differs in important ways from what people experience in real life. For example, British government regulations on the use of the herbicide 2,4,5T assumed circumstances unrecognizable as those under which farm workers actually used the substance (Irwin, 1995; Corburn, 2005). Local knowledgepublic experience and intuitionis a different kind of knowledge, differently gained, from the professional knowledge of scientific research and regulation (Corburn, 2005). \r\n\r\nOvercoming the rift between professional and local knowledge lies in a constructive renegotiation between science and the needs of citizens (Irwin, 1995, p. 110). In what Corburn (2005) calls Street Science, professional science and the people most affected by it combine to co-produce knowledge that benefits both. In the field of environmental health, this co-production reveals hazards and provides information that professionals may miss, reduces mistrust of science, empowers community members, and creates positive engagement with problems instead of entrenched and polarized positions (2005, p. 218).\r\n\r\nLocal knowledge can both amplify and stimulate professional knowledge. The Watchperson project in the Greenpoint/Williamsburg section of Brooklyn NY combined government datasets and conducted surveys to map sources of air pollution at greater detail than regulators models (Corburn, 2005). Recent developments in wireless mobile sensors create possibilities for mapping pollutant levels at much finer detail than previously possible; one example using human volunteers is AIR (2006).\r\n\r\nThe scientific profession can further the co-production of knowledge by reaching out to individuals, communities and citizen groups. BirdSource (www.birdsource.org) uses an Internet-based tool to help more than 50,000 birdwatchers develop a deeper understanding of science and the environment while they accumulate data that helps to identify priorities for conservation. This extends the reach of science by providing knowledge that scientists would lack the resources to gather by themselves (Fitzpatrick & Gill, 2002).\r\n\r\nScience Shops and Cooperative Extensions offer ground-breaking resources for the co-production of knowledge. Science Shops (such as www.scienceshop.org) provide university scientific expertise to the public, at the instigation either of students or citizen groups. The University of Rhode Island Cooperative Extension (www.uri.edu/cce) Watershed Watch program works with government, tribal organizations and citizen groups to train volunteer water-quality monitors. Cornell Cooperative Extension (www.cce.cornell.edu) provides scientific expertise and conducts scientific research as part of a mission to extend the democratic process by helping people participate in their communities (Peters, OConnell, Alter & Jack, 2006).\r\n\r\nCitizen groups can further their own aims while extending the reach of science. For example, the Ocean Conservancy (www.oceanconservancy.org) conducts an international cleanup of marine debris on the third Saturday in September each year. While helping to clean the coastline, volunteers collect data that enables the Ocean Conservancy to learn about the causes of marine debris and to use this information in public education and advocacy. \r\n\r\nBecause mainstream scientific research does not pre-determine its conclusions, its use in advocacy is a double-edged sword. Activists may better spend their time in political lobbying than in scientific research whose results may not support their agenda. Just as the public mistrusts research funded by tobacco companies, for example, research by activist groups may appear suspect to policymakers and professional scientists. Despite this, many avenues are open for activists to initiate research that furthers their aims. Two examples follow. \r\n\r\nAiming to show a connection between pollution from incinerators, toxic waste storage and other industrial sources in the neighborhood and asthma in Greenpoint/Williamsburg, the El Puente group (www.elpuente.us) trained community members as community health workers and in conducting surveys. Their twofold process, of gathering information on asthma in surveys and then discussing the results in focus groups, uncovered knowledge about: (a) a link between womens occupations and asthma not directly related to environmental pollution, (b) differing levels of asthma amongst Hispanic groups, and (c) underreported asthma rates because people avoided treatment at the local hospital (Corburn, 2005).\r\n\r\nThe Centre for Science and Environment (www.cseindia.org) uses the results of its own scientific research to publicize problems and solutions. A recent achievement has been the research-based development of rainwater harvesting methods, combined with community outreach and advocacy to policymakers, offering a politics of hope to those whose water supplies are declining in quantity and quality (www.rainwaterharvesting.org).', 'Use and develop means of collaboration between science and communities.

It\'s intended for researchers, activists, citizens and for anybody who is trying to make sense of the world.', 'John Urry articulated the need to reconceptualize sociology in such a way to better understand and explore the \"mobilities\" of our era (2000). <i>Mobilities</i> characterize movement from one state to another in the broadest sense. A reconceptualization of social mobilities extends the core notion of people moving from one place to another, whether to fight &mdash; or escape from &mdash; a war, pursue economic opportunities that aren\'t available at home, visit family, attend college, make a religious pilgrimages, conduct business or visit resorts or museums as a tourist. Urry reminds us that people are not the only entities in the <i>social universe.</i> These new mobilities include the movement of commodities, raw materials, microbes, mobs and soccer hooligans, AK-47s and fissionable material, ideologies, tactics, criminal networks, social issues, social movements, money (legitimate and otherwise), brands, virtual communities, financial information, smuggled people, radioactivity, movies, pirated DVDs, pollution, oil, electricity, water, surveillance, terrorist cells, drugs, and credit card information. In addition to those mobilities social status of individuals and, even identity itself, can change through movement to a higher or lower economic class, becoming a citizen &mdash; or refugee &mdash; in another country, or undergoing a sex change or religious conversion. \r\n\r\nUrry points out that sociology places social interaction at is core and is therefore the proper intellectual home for these considerations. Yet sociology as it\'s currently construed was created at a certain point in <i>Western</i> history and it often presupposes notions like <i>structure</i> or <i>function</i> that belie the inherent complexity of social interactions, forces, etc. Its area of focus is like the old \"flat earth\" perspective where the areas outside the known territory are simply <i>terra incognito.</i>. Urry advocates a new type of sociology that extends the traditional sociological tenets to a new sociology that more accurately reflects today\'s realities. Specifically Urry adds, <i>networks</i> and <i>fluids</i> to the traditional idea of \"region\" (upon which \"metaphor\" the \"sociological concept of society is based\") as important exemplars to be added to the new mix of phenomena and artifacts that need to be considered when interpreting new social realities. Networks contain structure or what Urry calls \"scapes,\" the \"networks of machines, technologies, organizations, texts and actors that constitute various interconnected nodes,\" and \"flows\" which pass through the \"scapes.\" Fluids, unlike networks, don\'t move discretely from node to node along scapes but are \"heterogeneous, uneven mobilities of people, information, objects, money, images, and risks, that move chaotically across regions in strikingly faster and unpredictable shapes.\" \r\n\r\nSome of the patterns in this language are ambiguous and hazy and whose recommendations can be summarized with non-committal \"more research is needed\" statements. One may get the impression that \"more research\" is <i>always</i> needed &mdash; if you ask an academic. Given the fact that all knowledge is incomplete, it may seem impossible to avoid that \"last refuge\" of a scholar, who is seemingly unable to make recommendation, until, they claim, their new research &mdash; once funded &mdash; will certainly bring the results that would enable them to make recommendations. The \"Mobile Intelligence\" pattern is one of those (hopefully few) patterns that generally follow the line above. It will surely morph in future versions of the language, possibly by splitting into several patterns that exploit new opportunities &mdash; or confront new threats &mdash; that were undreamt of today. \r\n\r\nThe coverage of this pattern extends from the most abstract and theoretical to the nitty-gritty <i>street level.</i> It relates to <i>how we think and converse</i> in broad strokes, about social change, the environment, etc. when we take the time <i>outside</i> of other work, as well as our thoughts and action when we\'re <i>thrown-in</i> a situation (Heidegger, 1962). In an example of the latter, Mary Jordan (2006) reports on an emerging new type of Mobile Intelligence: <blockquote>\"Cell phones and text messaging are changing the way political mobilizations are conducted around the world. From Manila to Riyadh and Kathmandu protests once publicized on coffeehouse bulletin boards are now organized entirely through text-messaging networks that can reach vast numbers of people in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\nThe technology is also changing the organization and dynamics of protests, allowing leaders to control, virtually minute-by-minute, the movements of demonstrators, like military generals in the field. Using texts that communicate orders instantly, organizers can call for advances or retreats of waves of protesters.\"</blockquote> And in 2003, when US President George Bush on a visit to London was keeping as far from the public eye as he could, protesters set up a \"Chasing Bush\" system that encouraged people to announce their Bush-sightings via the SMS on their cell phones which would then be relayed to protesters who would hasten to the location. The \"Flash Mob\" concept, in which a \"spontaneous\" gathering of a large number of people at a rug store or hotel lobby has been orchestrated with the aid of fast and inexpensive access to mobile communications, provides a glimpse into the future as to the absurd and amusing possibilities that the new technology can bring. It\'s easy to see that mobile communications has its dark sides, a point that Howard Rheingold brings up in his aptly-titled book <i>Smart Mobs.</i> A mob consists of people who are operating wholly at the limbic level. While \"rationality\" and \"cool-headed reason\" may be flawed, over-rated, and mostly mythical as operating concepts, consider a world in which they were totally absent. \r\n\r\nNew technologies (such as GPS, cell phones, cell phones with GPS, RFID, \"smart cards\", bar codes, laptops, \"augmented reality\" (where commercial information can be broadcast to your goggles), wireless technologies like 802.11b, etc..) are changing and are likely to continue to change our urban settings in particular (which are already undergoing massive changes due to globalization and new patterns of human settlements). Alex Steffen on his <i>World Changing</i> web site quotes the following from the <i>Breaking the Game</i> conference (2006) both permeate urban spaces (changing their uses) and change the way we look at buildings and place (changing development).<blockquote> \"[A]n emerging group of artists [is] deploying sensors, hand-held electronics, and faster Internet connections are developing projects that actively intervene in the shaping and reshaping of public spaces in contemporary cities. They are integrating digital technology into buildings in order to make them adaptive and responsive to the flows of human activity and environmental forces... They are scanning the unseen electromagnetic spectrum that surrounds specific places, and turning these data into compelling audio/visual experiences that both heighten and change our perception... Using PDAs and portable laptops connected wirelessly to databases, some artists are creating alternative social maps, counter-histories and individually annotated narratives about local populations in specific neighborhoods... Still others are using mobile social software to coordinate large numbers of bodies for political action; or devising playful and imaginary spaces within the city.... We don\'t have to leave or disconnect from physical space in order to connect to digital spaces. Artists, architects, technologists, urban planners, and others are recombining the two, connecting individuals and groups together at a variety of scales and intensities.\" </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt is an understatement to say that mobile communications represents a major historic shift from historical patterns of communications. The Internet (and other) information and communication technologies have helped usher in tremendous changes already, but these changes may represent just the tip of the iceberg. Mobile communication is fast and increasingly commonplace. It opens up whole new arenas of both thought and action. Like many new technologies, the opportunities for abuse are legion &mdash; and critics should not be cowed into submission by new digital salesmen and their cheerleaders in the media. Some of the dimensions by which to consider barriers, boundaries and opportunities include: accessibility (costs of producing/consuming, location, language, etc.); relative size and influence and the relationship configuration between information producer and consumer (one or few or many or mass to one or few or many or mass); privacy, regulation, and  control; motivation for use; and user demographics.   \r\n\r\nSociologists, historians and others are now realizing that social phenomena (like environmental phenomena) are inherently complex. This means that we can\'t really know with certainty what the effects of our actions will be. Although this has always been the case, the realization is only now getting some traction. Moreover, many people &mdash; if not most &mdash; still seem to deny its reality and think and act according to older paradigms. Accepting its reality does not mean of course that we don\'t know anything or that <i>anything can happen</i>, What is different now is the increased speed, reach, and influence of the mobility. Imagine a missile latching on to the frequency of a cell phone or myriad consequences of remote observation, sensing, and surveillance. On a larger scale, consider the vulnerability or volatility of a complex physical, social, or technological environment where critical limits or \"tipping points\" in many important areas are likely to be breached at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhile much of our time in the future will certainly be spent trying to repulse the efforts of people who will use (and attempt to use) Mobile Intelligence to increase their dominance over others, one of the main points of this pattern is to encourage the exploration of positive possibilities that the new technology opens up. One such area is in the realm of emergency communications. What difference could it make in a situation like the Chernobyl disaster or Hurricane Katrina? We could also gather data about dangerous conditions &mdash; speed of cars, air or water quality, radioactivity and other mobile phenomena.', 'We can think of Mobile Intelligence in at least three ways: (1) intelligence about a variety of mobilities; (2) intelligence that can be used in different situations (where the intelligence itself is mobile or \"portable\"); and, (3), mobile intelligence that moves us forward; in other words the intelligence <i>mobilizes</i> people. As researchers, activists and citizens, we can consciously ask about the \"mobility\" of our intelligences &mdash; and reconceptualize them as necessary.', NULL, 551, 879, '2006-12-11 10:30:37', '2006-12-11 10:16:39', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(248, 238, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Because technology and technological systems can play out in so many ways, this is one of the longest problem statements in the pattern language. \r\n\r\nTechnological systems are often portrayed as nearly miraculous <i>solutions</i> to problems both real and imagined. For this reason, people put faith in technology that is not always warranted. Moreover, the technologists peddling techno-utopian visions in which technology causes problems to vanish &mdash; essentially by magic &mdash; are not subjected to the same scrutiny that other societal prognosticators receive. For one reason, technologists by virtue of their special knowledge and unfathomable jargon are often intimidating to non-technologists. \r\n\r\nAn unquestioning reliance on technology can result in a technocratic culture where people come to expect technological solutions. Technology puts major decisions in the hands of the technologists; degrades public discussion; diverts attention, discussion, and funds. Socio-technological systems generally have implicit trajectories. They\'re often implemented as \"total programs\" when almost by definition they are partial solutions that don\'t address or the social aspects either with analysis, co-design, education or funding. This is what is generally lacking when introducing computers into the classroom or in discussions about bringing inexpensive laptops to the children of Africa. \r\n\r\nThe use of technology often introduces new problems including ones that humankind is not prepared for. (And then of course \"technology will solve the new problems.\") Introducing mandatory laptop computers in a middle school or high school, for example, soon leads to additional issues. Should students be able to use Instant Messenger during class? Download movies? Play fantasy baseball? As was pointed out in the play, Mitzi\'s Abortion (Hefron, 2005), based on a true story, technology can tell a pregnant woman that the baby she\'s carrying has no brain, but it can\'t provide any guidance on what she can do about the situation or how to negotiate with her insurance company to help her with financial burdens that may arise. Technology can be used for dumbing down (and having technology shouldn\'t be an excuse for ignorance &mdash; Why learn anything when I can simply find the knowledge on the Internet whenever I want to!). \r\n\r\nMoreover, it almost goes without saying that technology is the near perfect candidate for systems of exploitation, control, and surveillance. Machines will never be seized with doubts about ethics or morality as a human pressed into an inhuman situation may be. On the other hand, we must continually remind ourselves that technology breaks down. It is not perfect and never will be. The large number of failed tests of the Strategic Defense Initiatives, the mixed results of laptops in schools, the quiet withdrawal of facial recognition systems for \"homeland security,\" and the potential for economic collapse due to unanticipated results of automated buying and selling all show the imperfection of our technological creations. The irony is, however, that technology might be most dangerous when it works correctly. For example, wouldn\'t a total failure of nuclear or biological weapons be preferable to \"success?\" Although Isaac Asimov presumed that humans would never allow robots to make life or death decisions or take the life of a human, the \"launch on warning\" computerized systems in the US (and presumably Russia) are virtually the same, minus the anthropomorphic features we\'ve come to expect in our robots.', 'Virtually anybody who is alive today will be confronted with new technology that is likely to change the circumstances of their life.', 'The interesting and more useful use of the word <I>criticism</I> is as it is used in art or literary criticism,, namely the analysis, evaluation, interpretation and judging of something. Technology, or, rather, its <I>practice including discourse, development, use, education, funding, regulation, and disposal,</I> in addition to its physical embodiment, deserves this type of attention like all other aspects and creations of humankind. \r\n\r\nAlthough technology, and ICT particularly, has a variety of attributes &mdash; or \"affordances\" &mdash; that will allow / encourage new capabilities (while discouraging others) and individual people obviously will play important roles in technology use (in the small?), the extreme \"weight\" of the social context will always exert considerable impact. The mistake that people most frequently make is forgetting the fundamental fact that technology in all of its guises is applied within specific social contexts. In other words, the phrase <i>Guns don\'t kill people, people kill people</i> could be more accurate if it read, <i>Guns don\'t kill people, they just vastly improve the ease and efficiency of doing so.</i> Without the \"need\" to shoot people only a fraction of the world\'s arsenal would exist. There is no such thing as \"technology by itself\" and, therefore, it makes no sense to view it in those terms. \r\n\r\nThe Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly called \"Star Wars\" illustrates many of the reasons why techno criticism is so necessary. Basically untestable, demonstrably unreliable, The SDI effort escalates militarism at the expense of non-military solutions while removing large sums of money from other more worthwhile enterprises. Additional militarization of space and the development of the next-generation of nuclear weapons also cry out for very deep technocriticism. \r\n\r\nOne of the most visible, current manifestations of techno-utopianism is that revolving around the prospects of a new \"$100 Laptop\" ostensibly for the children of Africa. Although many people believe that computers have intrinsic \"subversive\" nature that would empower people around the world it\'s not at all clear to me why African kids would be less attracted to <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> or other violent, time-squandering video games, then, say, their American counterparts if a brand-new laptop computer was suddenly in their possession. \r\n\r\nA last example provides a glimpse of what can happen when fast computers and knowledge of human behavior are combined within specific systems of power. In a provocative article entitled, \"AI Seduces Stanford Students\" (200_) Kevin Poulsen describes a phenomenon called the \"chameleon effect\" in which \"People are perceived as more honest and likeable if they subtly mimic the body language of the person they\'re speaking with.\" Now scientists at Stanford University\'s Virtual Human Interaction Lab have demonstrated that computers can exploit the same phenomenon, but with greater success and on a larger scale. Sixty-nine student volunteers interacted with a realistic human face, a computer generated \"digital agent\" that delivered a three-minute persuasive speech. Unbeknownst and undetected by seven out of eight students, the talking head was mimicking their every expression &mdash; eye movements, head tilts, etc. \r\n\r\nThe ominous result of this experiment was that the students reported that the echoing \"agent\" was \"more friendly, interesting, honest, and persuasive\" than the one that didn\'t blindly ape the facial movements of its mark. One doesn\'t need excess paranoia to imagine what lay in store for us when ubiquitous mass media systems, perhaps two-way, are joined with the system described above. Poulsen describes one way in which this could be accomplished. <blockquote> \"Bailenson [the Stanford researcher] says the research not only shows that computers can take advantage of our psychological quirks, but that they can do it more effectively than humans can because they can execute precise movements with scientifically optimized timing. The killer app is in virtual worlds, where each inhabitant can be presented with a different image, and the chameleon effect is no longer limited to one-on-one interaction. A single speaker &mdash; whether an AI or a human avatar &mdash; could mimic a thousand people at once, undetected, transforming a cheap salesman\'s trick into a tool of mass influence.\" </blockquote> Ironically the people who are best equipped to apply this pattern are the people who know the most about how technology is designed, deployed, marketed, etc. <i>Technophiles probably make the best Technocritics.</i> This is an argument for technical education that is integrated with the humanities and the social sciences, marriage that many people in the non-technical disciplines might find as distasteful as those in the technical disciplines do. A society that was technologically literate would not \"throw technology at problems\" any more than they\'d \"throw money at problems.\" That, however, is not at all the same as saying that technology or money never can help solve problems &mdash;\' as both resources when applied wisely can help immensely. \r\n\r\nOrganizations like Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility who have worked with issues like SDI and electronic voting and groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists and Electronic Privacy Information Center are working in this area. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists provides thoughtful discussion on matters of weapons and national security. The world is ready for discussions in this area that aren\'t dominated by the media and the digerati. Many policy options come to mind, but in general, they should be based on informed public discourse. One intriguing example of this is the \"co development laws\" in Scandinavia in the 1980s in which new technology could not be introduced without the consent of the workers. Another ripe field is that of genetic engineering of seeds and other biological entities. \r\n\r\nLuddism is not an answer to the question of \"autonomous technology\" anymore than it is to uncritically embrace it. The solution is not to totally eschew the use of technology in society. Technology is an integral part of the human condition. At the same time it is important for the reasons discussed above to acknowledge and to consider how technology is presented, designed, discussed, implemented and used, just as other activities, particularly ones with similar potential for large-scale disruption should be subjected to this scrutiny. Unfortunately there is a surprising number of people who interpret any of this discussion as being \"anti-technology\" (which is barely even thinkable). At any rate, this reaction has a chilling effect on the idea of actual conversations on the technology (as would befit a democratic society) and has the adverse effect of reinforcing the stereotype that technologists are binary thinkers who are simply not capable of more nuanced thought. \r\n\r\nLangdon Winner, one of the intellectual founders of technocriticism (along with Lewis Mumford, Norbert Weiner, and, even, Dwight Eisenhower) made these statements in relation to the advent of ubiquitous digital computer networks: <blockquote>As we ponder horizons of computing and society today, it seems likely that American society will reproduce some of the basic tendencies of modernism.<ul><li>unequal power over key decisions about what is built and why;</li><li>concerted attempts to enframe and direct people\'s lives in both work and consumption; </li><li>the presentation of the future society as something nonnegotiable; </li><li>the stress on individual gratification rather than collective problems and responsibilities; </li><li>design strategies that conceal and obfuscate important realms of social complexity.</li></ul> </blockquote> Although technological systems can be extremely powerful, they are subject to a number of limitations that must be understood and probed thoroughly if these systems are to be deployed effectively in society. A more visible, inclusive and engaging practice of Techno Criticism could go a long way towards educating society on the myriad implications &mdash; both creative and destructive &mdash; of technology in today\'s world. \r\n\r\n\r\nIntroductory graphic is from <a href=\"http://www.lmgo.com/lmgo/portfolio/mcdonalds.html\">http://www.lmgo.com/lmgo/portfolio/mcdonalds.html.</a>', 'Technology often alters power relations between people, generally amplifying the power for some and not for others. The development of new military technology through history dramatically illustrates this phenomenon. The distribution of computers in society is yet another example. Generally, rich people have them and poor people don\'t. If computers enable people to be more productive (as computer related companies assert) then economic benefits would obviously accrue to those that have them. People need to understand or at least anticipate to some degree not only the effects of specific technological artifacts (RFID in running shoes, for example) but the socio-technological systems that they support or destabilize.', NULL, 522, 420, '2006-12-11 10:35:21', '2006-12-11 10:34:38', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

It is their work which inspires this pattern and many of the ideas advanced in this pattern originated in their writings. Disclaimer: The concept of a \"Global Peoples Parliament\" comes from Richard Falk and Andrew Strauss. The version advocated here is not \"official\" (nor authoritative). \r\n\r\nCivil society is obligated to create institutions that are strong enough to challenge other organization -- governments, businesses, criminal groups, extremists -- but not on <i>their</i> terms.\r\n\r\nThis pattern has only partial analogs in the \"real world.\" This is due, generally, to the extremely broad scope of its coverage &mdash; it is supposed to address <I>all</I> of the world\'s inhabitants! The very fact of globalization provides the most solid support (and for the <I>need</I>) of the World Citizen Parliament pattern. Smaller versions that approximate some aspects of this pattern do, of course, exist, and we can learn a lot from these experiments as we attempt to cultivate and grow democratic forms that are more wide-ranging. The European Parliament may be the most prominent example of a large civic society institution whose representatives are democratically elected by people from various countries.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is related to INDEPENDENT REGIONS, the first pattern in <i>A Pattern Language.</i> Alexander was striving to identify the right level of autonomy based on \"natural limits to the size of groups that can govern themselves in a human way.\" Metropolitan regions will not come to balance until each one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent sphere of culture. That pattern\'s solution states that, \"Wherever possible, work toward the evolution of independent regions in the world; each with a population between 2 and 10 million; each with its own natural and geographic boundaries; each with its own economy; each one autonomous and self-governing; each with a seat in a world government, without the intervening power of larger states or countries.\" \r\n\r\nAlexander\'s pattern and ours have similarities and differences. Both presuppose an increased voice of the citizen through additional opportunities for participation and new collective bodies that are independent from governments as they now exist. At first glance the two approaches might seem incompatible &mdash; Alexander\'s pattern does not call for an all-citizen\'s body nor does this pattern mention autonomous regions. The parliament concept, however, does not rule out autonomous, independent regions per se, only that individual people would have a forum for addressing issues was outside of their independent region &mdash; or what looks very much like a <i>country</i> but with new boundaries that better reflected cultural and natural boundaries (which does little or nothing about addressing the realities of various cultural or ethnic or religious groups \"stranded\" behind redrawn boundaries). Moreover, the state conceptualized in Alexander\'s pattern could actually be attained in a more \"natural\" evolutionary way through this pattern. \r\n\r\nDeveloping a top-down approach is neither viable nor consonant with the principles of civil society. This leaves us with the option of developing principles and ideas that are we believe are at the core of what a federation should be and allows the parliament grow or evolve, built from the seeds that we envision today. This envisioned global federation would then become a type of ecosystem for collective bodies. [Ideally it would be principled and explicitly cooperative -- but how to ensure? At the same time we would need to ensure that it doesn\'t become just another arena for people to exploit for their own interests. Use the Commons ideas from Bollier, Ostrom and others, for one thing. The World Social Forum provides many important ideas about how this could be accomplished. What distinguishes this from how things exist already is an explicit declaration and decision to participate in the project, to share information with others and to communicate with other collectives in the federation.\r\n\r\nCollective groups are generally composed of people in a geographically delimited area (some of whom have passed certain formal requirements for membership and attained the status of citizen), of people with similar professional interests (e.g. medical associations or labor unions), or social aims or philosophy (American Civil Liberties Union, American Rifle Association, etc. ) \r\n\r\nThe draft statement that I proposed at the Online Deliberation Conference / Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing Symposium, Stanford University, on May 22, 2005, sums up the important aspects of this pattern.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In many places attempts are being made to trivialize citizenship and reconstitute citizens as (everyday) consumers and (sporadic) voters. Real power is in many ways being transferred to large corporations and other unelected organizations such as the World Trade Organization. \r\n\r\nRealizing the growing and critical importance of citizens and civic society in addressing humankind\'s common problems, we the undersigned propose the initiation of a \"Grand Challenge\" whose ultimate objective is the development of a World Citizen Parliament. We realize that this is an extremely complex project that will require years of complex, nuanced, creative and thoughtful negotiation and collaboration. We are aware that this project will have to address an extremely broad range of social and cross-cultural factors. We, however, believe that beginning this discussion in an explicit and open way is preferable to many other varieties of globalization that lack this transparency.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we realize that precisely defining an ideal system in advance is impossible. For that reason, we propose to begin a principled, long-term, incremental, participatory design process that integrates experimental, educational, community mobilization, research and policy work all within a common intellectual orientation: specifically to provide an inclusive intellectual umbrella for a diverse, distributed civil society effort. We realize &mdash; of course &mdash; that this is an audacious proposal. However, we agree with Richard Falk, that a parliament or forum like this is critical for the future of humankind and our planet. Civil society historically is the birthplace of socially ameliorative visions. This effort is intended to help build a more effective platform for these efforts, to help address humankind\'s shared problems &mdash; such as environmental degradation, human rights abuses, economic injustice and war &mdash; that other sectors &mdash; notably government and business &mdash; are seemingly powerless to stem. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nUltimately we would expect that the recommendations that are issued will play important roles in policy development of the future as well as in our ways of thinking. Each of the experiments that we undertake in the next few years will undoubtedly have drawbacks, some of which will be revealed only as people attempt to address real concerns. Information and communication technology will play an important role in many of these projects and people in these fields will need to work with social scientists, representatives from civil society organizations and many others if a World Citizen Parliament that sensitively, fairly, and wisely explores and addresses the concerns of the under-represented citizens of the world is ever created.', 'Launch a non-centralized, heterogeneous, loosely-linked network of people, online and offline resources, institutions, deliberative and other collaborative settings.

We continue to spend at Cold War levels despite the fact that, as we are slowly learning, none of the most pressing 21st century threats to security &mdash; terrorism, proliferation, climate change &mdash; are effectively addressed by military force. Why? In part because the livelihoods of millions of people in politically powerful military-dependent institutions and communities are tied to the flow of military dollars.', 'This troubled world is very different today than even a few decades ago. We have more to fear from handfuls of determined terrorists and blowback from the environmental damage we have done than from attack by standing armies. Changing times call for changing strategies, yet people with vested economic interests in the status quo always feel threatened by change. Those convinced that our continued wellbeing depends on redirecting national priorities will find it easier to bring about change if they can reassure people tied into the current system that their economic wellbeing is not at risk.', 'Economic conversion is the process of efficiently transferring people and facilities from military-oriented to civilian-oriented activity. Changing the consequences of substantial military spending cuts from massive job loss to a change in what people produce on the job removes the politically powerful jobs argument. By forcing military programs to be judged on their real contribution to security, conversion is important to more intelligent decision making on national priorities. \r\n\r\nHuge military budgets are ineffective in facing down 21st century threats to security. Obviously, military spending offers no advantage in confronting the threat of increasingly severe weather events (hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods) that, with other environmental disasters, appear directly linked to global warming. Less obviously but equally true, military force is of little use in confronting terrorist threats. The worlds most powerful military did nothing to prevent or stop the 9-11 attacks. Virtually every terrorist caught, every terrorist plot foiled has been the result of first-rate intelligence and police work, not the threat or use of military force. Military force has also been useless in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\r\n\r\nNot only is high military spending ineffective in addressing the most pressing security threats, it is also a serious drain on economic strength, one of the most important sources of national wellbeing and international influence. This idea is hardly new in economics, going back to Adam Smith, the 18th century founder of capitalism. Smith argued that military spending was economically unproductive. Decades ago, economists commonly used military burden almost synonymously with military budget. \r\n\r\nToday, the problem is the same, but some mechanisms are different. Large numbers of highly skilled engineers and scientists are needed to develop modern technologically sophisticated military weapons and related systems. But engineers and scientists are also critical to modern civilian industry. They develop new technologies that improve products and processes, driving the growth of productivity, which allows producers to pay higher wages and still keep prices low. Rising wages and low prices are the recipe for increasing economic prosperity. Quality products at low prices are also key to keeping industries competitive with rivals abroad, and therefore to keeping unemployment low and profits strong.\r\n\r\nBy directing the nations technological talent away from developing the technologies civilian-oriented producers need, huge military budgets drain a nations economic vitality. This is one reason for both the collapse of the Soviet Union and the de-industrialization of the United States. Thus, there are compelling economic and security arguments for re-orienting national priorities. Economic conversion facilitates this process. \r\n\r\nWhen World War II ended, the U.S. transferred 30 percent of its economic output from military-oriented to civilian-oriented activity in one year (1945-46) without unemployment rising above 3 percent. That remarkable feat, which depended on advanced planning by the private sector <i>and</i> government, successfully reconverted an economy that had moved into military production during the war back to producing the civilian products it made before the war. Though the scale is smaller today, the problem is more complicated. Unlike the 1940s reconversion, most of those working today in what President Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex have never done anything but military-oriented work. And the difference between military and civilian-oriented activity has become much greater. The process is no longer one of going back to what is familiar; it is now a move to new work in a very different environment.\r\n\r\nFor example, military sector engineers today are under enormous pressure to squeeze every ounce of performance out of products they design. With enormous military budgets, cost is not nearly as important an issue. Civilian sector products must perform well, but keeping cost low is absolutely critical. Engineering for maximum performance with little attention to cost is very different from engineering for low cost with reasonable performance. To successfully transfer from military to civilian work, engineers must be retrained (given some different skills) and re-oriented (taught to look at engineering from a different perspective). In general, more specialized and skilled people require more retraining and re-orientation. \r\n\r\nConverting facilities and equipment requires assessing their character and condition to find the best match to productive civilian use. From 1961-1981, more than 90 U.S. military bases were closed and converted to industrial parks, research centers, college campuses, and airports --- with a net 20 percent <i>increase</i> in employment. In the 1990s, Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, Texas was converted to a booming civilian airport. In October 2005, the nuclear weapons complex at Rocky Flats, Colorado was closed, and the land on which it stood is being turned into a National Wildlife Refuge. \r\n\r\nThe conversion movement in the U.S. began in the 1970s and grew through the early 1990s. In 1977, bi-partisan sponsors introduced the National Economic Conversion Act in the Senate, and soon after in the House of Representatives. Repeatedly reintroduced through the years, it never became law. If it had, the decentralized nationwide private and public sector process of conversion planning and support it would have set up would have prevented the economic shockwave that military dependent workers and communities felt in the late 1980s/early 1990s, and made it politically much easier to forestall the subsequent return to Cold War military spending levels. \r\n\r\nGiven the urgent need to redirect the nations attention and resources to address the economic and security realities of the 21st century, economic conversion has never been more important. Through letters, town hall meetings and personal visits, our representatives in the Congress must learn that reducing the military drain on our economy is critical to rebuilding the American middle class, repairing our decaying national infrastructure, and addressing the real problems of homeland security. Working with existing citizens organizations, conversion can help build alliances among the growing number of businesspeople who oppose the unilateralist militarism that has poisoned the nations image abroad, workers who see themselves going backwards, and environmentalists who want the nation to free the resources necessary to stop the slow motion disaster of global warming.', 'Conversion defines economic alternatives for those tied into institutions of militarism and war anywhere, helping build support for redirecting national priorities toward more effective, nonmilitary solutions to real national security needs. It is also critical to removing the economic burden of high military budgets, and thus reinvigorating national economies.', NULL, 628, 579, '2006-08-28 18:16:25', '2006-09-27 15:53:55', NULL, NULL, 'University of Texas at Dallas', NULL, 359, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Particularly disturbing is the persistent tendency of political leaders to consider resort to war as their fundamental instrument for the resolution of international conflict and to divert vast resources to the preparation for war without being constrained by the limits set by international law governing the use of force.', 'It is important not to overstate the role and contributions of international law, which in the past has been used to lend an appearance of legality to colonialism and aggressive war as well as to serve the interests of oppressive governments who engaged in abuses of their populations, being shielded by the law that upheld the territorial supremacy of sovereign states. \r\n\r\nInternational law is relevant in many different settings that reflect the extraordinary diversity of transnational activity in the contemporary world. Legal professionals- lawyers- represent governments, corporations, banks, international institutions- to facilitate their activities, both by acting within the limits set by regulations contained in international law, and by altering legal standards to the extent helpful for more orderly conduct of affairs. Ordinary citizens, NGOs, and international civil servants all invoke international law to influence policy debates on a variety of global issues. International law is an important means for communicating claims and grievances, and provides insight into whether particular demands are reasonable or not.\r\n\r\nThe viability of international law has been recently drawn into serious question by the American response to the 9/11 attacks.  It has been claimed that the nature of international terrorism combined with potential access to weaponry of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, makes it unreasonable for states to wait to be attacked. The United States Government relied on such reasoning to justify its invasion of Iraq in 2003, which was widely regarded by international law specialists and world public opinion as a flagrant violation of both the UN Charter and international law. International law is partly motivated by considerations of mutual convenience (e.g. the immunity of ambassadors, safety signals at sea) and partly reflective of the accumulated wisdom of seasoned statesmen.', 'From the perspective of the United States, the country that is most responsible for establishing the legal framework governing war after World War II and also the main challenger in light of recent global developments, the resolution of the debate about whether to limit foreign policy by reference to international law is of the greatest importance. It should be noted that the two greatest failures in American foreign policy in the last fifty years have resulted from the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. These failures would not have occurred if American policy had been self-limited by reference to international law. It is a general fallacy to suppose that in the twenty-first century a powerful country is better off if it is not restricted in its policy options by law. The evidence suggests that the restrictions contained in international law reflect the encoded wisdom of several centuries of statecraft. The narrowing of the availability of war by international law over the course of the last century is an acknowledgement, in large part, of the growing dysfunctionality of war as instrument for the resolution of conflict.\r\n \r\nIt is not only war and uses of force that need to be regulated effectively by international law, it is also necessary for advancing the human security of peoples throughout the world afflicted by disease, poverty, environmental degradation, oppressive governance. Respect for law and international institutions encourages cooperative problem-solving that is increasingly necessary given the realities of globalization. In this regard, it is necessary to adapt the law-making procedures of the world to the significant roles being played by a variety of non-state actors, including market forces, regional organization, and civil society organizations. Whether incorporating this globalizing agenda and these non-state actors is achieved by an enlarged conception of international law, or by a transition in legal conceptualizing that adopts the terminology of global law is less important than the realization that the law dimension of world order is of critical importance in the struggle to achieve a less violent, more equitable, and more sustainable future for the whole of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe prospects for  strengthening international law have two important current centers of gravity: (1) the unresolved debate in the United States as to whether to pursue security within a framework that respects international law and the authority of the United Nations. The learning experience associated with the failure of the Iraq policy needs to be converted into a renewed appreciation that reliance on military dominance and discretionary wars is dysfunctional at this stage of history, and that a voluntary respect for international law would simultaneously serve the national and global interest.\r\nThe resolution of this debate is of great importance to Americans and the world because of the leadership role that the United States plays on the global stage. The evidence supports the view that American global leadership will only recover its claims of legitimacy if it is able to revive its earlier enthusiasm for promoting the rule of law in world politics.\r\n(2) This specific debate, heightened in intensity after 9/11, hides an underlying set of issues associated with achieving a more effective and equitable approach to global governance in light of a series of world order challenges that have been generated by such problems as global warming, an imminent energy squeeze, mass migrations, and an array of self-determination struggles. At present, contradictory trends are undermining efforts to fashion a humane approach to these challenges. On the one side, globalization in all its forms is rendering the boundaries of states increasingly irrelevant to the patterning of many substantive concerns, while at the same time border controls are growing harsher and walls are being created to fence some people in and others out.\r\nThis requires a new set of international legal initiatives, ambitiously conceived, to address these problems in a manner that does not produce chaos, oppressive violence, and ecological collapse. It is no longer acceptable to consider that world order can be entrusted to sovereign states pursuing their short-term interests. Protecting the future for the peoples of the world presupposes an ethos of responsibility, which in turn rests on the willingness to replace traditions of unilateralism and coercion with improved procedures of cooperation and persuasion. It is here that the past and future of international law offers hope to humanity provided the turn away from law can be reversed. \r\n\r\nThe growing fragility and complexity of international life provides a fundamental argument for strengthening international law, and for moving toward the establishment of global law that is able to regulate for the common good activities of market forces, regional organizations, international institutions, civil society actors, as well as the behavior of states. With a growing prospect of an energy squeeze requiring a momentous shift to a post-petroleum world society, the strains on regulatory regimes will be immense. Trust in and respect for international law will encourage approaches that are more likely to be fair and effective than the sort of chaos and resentments that will follow if relative power and wealth are relied upon to shift the main burdens of adjustment to the weak and poor.', 'The lessons of failed wars over the course of recent decades need to be converted into a sophisticated appreciation that reliance on military superiority and discretionary recourse to wars has become increasingly dysfunctional at this stage of history, and extremely wasteful with respect to vital resources needed to achieve other essential human goals, including the reduction of poverty, disease, and crime. Protecting the future for the peoples of the world presupposes an ethos of responsibility, which in turn rests on the willingness by both the powerful and the disempowered to replace whenever possible, coercion with persuasion, and to rely much more on cooperative and nonviolent means to achieve order and change. Law is centrally important in providing guidelines and procedures for moving toward a less violent, more equitable, and more sustainable future for the whole of humanity. With the rise of non-state actors (market and civil society actors; international institutions of regional and global scope) there is underway a necessary transition from an era of <i>international</i> law to an epoch of <i>global</i> law. It will be beneficial for the citizens and governments of the world to encourage this transition.', NULL, 565, 810, '2006-08-03 12:10:34', '2006-10-30 09:17:32', NULL, NULL, 'Prof. Emeritus Int.

A handful of western-based trans-national media corporations, working in tandem with regional companies, control most programming, emphasising entertainment to recruit urban consumers, and circulating news primarily framed by the interests of corporate business and western foreign policy. Public programming to encourage dialogue and debate of public issues has withered.  Stark inequalities are increasing, in both poor and rich countries, between those with the full means to produce communications and those without, especially if we factor in the violence of poverty, illiteracy, and patriarchal, racial, and caste oppression.', 'A global network of communications activists, advocates and researchers is emerging to address these problems. This network of networks operates simultaneously on at least three planes, the <I>construction of alternative communications media, the reform of the mainstream corporate and state media,</I> and the support of <I>trans-national communications networks for social change movements. Alternative media</I> projects (zines, radio, video, television and internet sites and blogs) not only serve people seldom represented in the corporate media; they also demonstrate what democratic media might look like in their alternative content, modes of operation and overall philosophy.  Communication reformers campaign to make existing local, national and global communications systems more accessible, representative, accountable and participatory. \r\n\r\nFinally, media activists work in support of social change movements whose <I>transnational communications networks</I> also provide additional links for the movements to democratize media. \r\n\r\nWhy now? This is due to at least three inter-related global trends. First, the global shift to neo-liberalism presents people all over the world with a complicated, but very clear set of common problems. Secondly, the communications networks first emerged as links among social justice movements to address these common problems. Finally, the network of communications networks began to take its own shape, as groups everywhere inventively adapted the glut of consumer hardware and software from the transnational corporate market.', '<b>A New World Information Communications Order (NWICO)</b>\r\nThe trans-national movement to transform communications predates the shift to global neo-liberalism. During the 1970s, led by the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a coalition of national governments of the global south, mobilized to challenge the old imperial status quo in which news, information and entertainment media were controlled by western governments and corporate powers. They called within the UN System for a New World Information and Communications Order (NWICO), for an end to the dominance of the western colonial powers, the equitable distribution of the worlds information resources, the <I>right to communicate,</I> and the support of alternative and community based media in democratizing communications. Rejecting this multilateral consensus, the US and UK Governments withdrew from the Commission, arguing with the commercial media industry that any measures to limit western media corporations or journalists represented state censorship of the free flow of information. \r\n\r\nThe US instead shifted to what we now call neo-liberalism, or the Washington agenda.  They called for market rules (privatization of public resources and deregulation of government oversight of corporations) at home and abroad. The Reagan Government successfully gutted anti-trust and public interest rules, as well as public support programs at home, and pushed for the implementation of similar policies in other countries through their powerful voice in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank (WB).  However, the US Government was still unable to win in the multilateral arena, failing to get culture (AV services) onto the trade block in the General Agreement on Trades and Tariffs (GATT), the precursor to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Instead, they decided to work on the less powerful countries one or two at a time, and began unilateral free trade talks with Taiwan, Canada and Mexico. \r\n\r\nDuring the same decade, the number and sophistication of alternative media projects and networks grew around the world. These networks emerged both from the confluence of links between social movements, primarily from the countries of the south, mobilizing against the Washington agenda; and alternative media groups inventively seizing the newly available consumer production media. Primarily based in local geographic communities, media activists began to link across their own countries, national and regional boundaries to share resources, and campaign for greater access to radio, cable and satellite, and the newly emerging computer-linked systems. They also began to support one another on common issues, including the massive cuts in public spending and state-run services, the growth in global media conglomeration, and the US, Japanese and European calls for global standards in digital systems and copyright rules.\r\n\r\nThe trans-national networks begun in this era include the World Association of Community Radio (AMARC) <amarc.org>, and the Association of Progressive Communicators (APC <apc.org>). AMARC now operates via regional organizations, programme sharing through special theme-connected collaborations (against, for example, discrimination against women, and racism) and global media reform coalitions. Formed to support the global network of women, labour, ecologists, indigenous peoples, and of activists organizing against free trade and corporate globalization, APC continues to build on the idea of communication rights, prioritizing the capacity building of women, rural and poor people, and the media reform efforts of member groups.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1990s, a new set of activists demonstrated the more tactical use of the technologies and networks in political change. In 1989, the pro-democracy activists of Tienanmen Square in Beijing China used fax machines to get their message out to the world . In 1994, the Zapatista National Liberation Army built on what Harry Cleaver called the emerging trans-national electronic fabric of struggle,  employing old and new media, and global media networks, to challenge the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Then, in 1997, the Korean labor and social movement activists use highly sophisticated broadband media to demonstrate against the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and also opened Jinbonet, the first Web-based interactive peoples news service. This alternative vision of communications took another leap forward in 1999 when the first Independent Media Center (IMC) formed in Seattle to support the protests against the World Trade Organization (WTO). Drawing from the Zapatistas, the IMCistas created a global news network. Building on the existing networks opposed to corporate globalization, and providing easy-to-use open-publishing software, the global IMC quickly grew to over 150 centers around the world. \r\n\r\n<b>International Network for Communications Reform</b>\r\nIn the last five years, the network of networks has begun to flex its collective muscles to reform the dominant global media system. Coalitions of activists, often in tandem with progressive government representatives, are calling for more democratic communications at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) (<See www.cris.org>); against the US push for the free trade of culture, with a Convention on Cultural Diversity, adopted by UNESCO in 2005 (http://www.cdc-ccd.org>); and for the protection of the global knowledge commons with a Development Agenda and a Treaty on Access to Knowledge and Technology at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).', 'More than a coalition of Nos, this new network of networks demonstrates that another communications is possible and already happening. Its strength is based in cooperation via social movement organizing, media reform campaigns and the adaptation of information and communications for the greater use of all. Almost all are severely challenged by their lack of sustainable funds and technical resources, and continuing inequities between members of racialized and gendered class differences and of cultural capital. However, faced with the stark realities of neo-liberal immiseration, the network continues to build, creating a complex lattice of local-local, regional (especially south-south), and trans-national links that circumvent the old colonial north-south linkages and power dynamics. If there is one glaring structural vacuum, it is the lack of involvement of US activists, and particularly those based in US communities and social justice movements. In the next five years, one of the key challenges will be for US activists to bring together efforts for media justice in the US, recognize the leadership of the rest of the world, and assist in mobilizing against the Washington agenda at home.\r\n\r\nWhat can people do to help build this network? In their own area, they can help support or produce programming for their local alternative communications media. They can also find and support the existing local, national and global campaigns to reform the mainstream corporate and state media. This is especially crucial in the US, whose media and media policy affect so much of the world. Finally they can educate themselves about whats going on in their own communities, national and especially internationally, and then help link the work of the local and global justice networks.', NULL, 148, 824, '2006-10-29 19:39:12', '2006-10-29 17:00:02', NULL, NULL, 'Dept. of Media Studies, University of San Francisc', NULL, 181, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

However, significant issues are typically intricate, ill-defined,, and conceptually complicated, to the point where whole careers are devoted to sorting out small portions of them, and action is delayed indefinitely or activist energy dissipated. But the alternative of rushing to action, substituting passion or outrage for understanding is counterproductive in its own well-documented ways.', 'This pattern is for people, on their own or within organizations, who are ready to initiate meaningful action. They have done enough analysis of whatever issue or problem they are concerned with, and have developed enough conviction to be sure that action is needed. Their question is, What action? or perhaps, How can I focus the notions, wishes, and urges that surround this issue into specific, meaningful steps? This pattern does not give detailed answers', 'The complexity of significant issues in the present time is overwhelming. This is obvious for national issues such as health care, outsourcing of jobs, or energy policy. But small scale problems, such as a derelict lot, are often equally complex (think of drug dealing, vandalism, invasive plants, liability, and city departmental turf battles) in relation to the energy and good will available to deal with them. Seemingly obvious moves (\"Let\'s all clean it up!\") get blocked in unexpected ways (\"Who are you to order us around?\") or generate further issues (the lot becomes a better place to play hooky). The activist has to escape the \"paralysis of analysis,\" but also must be accurate about the effects and costs of actions, which can radiate far beyond the immediate zone in which they occur. \r\n\r\nLarge and small scale social and environmental problems in the U.S. have come under concerted assault before, most notably in the Progressive era of the early 20th century. The great successes of that time, in clean water, safe housing, conservation of natural areas and much more, also established dispassionate expertise as the preferred approach to such issues (at least by liberals). Gather enough data, include enough considerations, weigh it objectively, and sensible, legally defensible decisions will emergeor so goes the argument. However, as the complexity of issues has increased, and as affluence has permitted many more parties to mobilize their own experts, the ideal of dispassionate expertise is becoming unreachable. Technicalities breed sub-technicalities, and the latter sub-sub-technicalities, in a fractal process of escalating delay and cost. And it turns out that many of the actors have more uses for the delays than for smooth functioning. \r\n\r\nThere is a way forward, embodied in the long tradition of physical design. Buildings, ships, bridges and dams, water systems and waste disposal are objects of transcendent complexity, if one tries to assemble in advance all the knowledge and technique that might be required to make them, but yet do come into existence, and serve their very diverse tasks effectively. \r\n\r\nThe process which generates buildings and bridges, namely \"design,\" is quite different from expert-based decision-making, even though expertise plays an enormous role in it. Instead of assuming that the answer can be deduced definitively from the evidence, the designer takes a different stance: The designer constructs, in imagination, an intervention in the world, and then uses powerful representations of the world, such as drawings, mathematical models, or simulations, to assess the ways in which the contemplated intervention would change the world. Usually, modifications are indicated, and the process goes round again, often numerous times, before the design settles into final form. \r\n\r\nThis design stance can be used for many different kinds of problems, from housebuilding to social activism. Houses are a straightforward example to start with. The early stages of designing a house are typically to have some very general ideas about its features and character, to choose a location, and to make some rough sketches or diagrams about how the features might be physically embodied. (By the way, many houses are not designed. They are copied or cut-and-pasted together from previous buildings and unexamined assumptions. Such houses are not under discussion here.) Already at this point, constraints and limitations begin to show themselves, such as high cost or the difficulty of all rooms having the same dramatic ocean view. Client(s) and designer(s) re-imagine the house in ways that address these challenges somehow, and may also reveal opportunities, for example a convenient location for storage.  New drawings  emerge, often with labels as to sizes, materials, and the like.There may be several rounds of imagining and drawing. Eventually the drawings have become detailed and definite enough to guide construction. The dream has evolved into a reality.\r\n\r\nSocial activists often use much the same process to establish a program or campaign for a reform. The locus of action is societal, say a budget decision, rather than physical; the constraints may have more to do with politics or social history than with drainage or carpeting; the number of people affected may be much larger than a household; there may be spreadsheets or maps or organizational charts rather than sketches or blueprints. But the same cycle of construction an intervention in the world, using imagination aided by concrete representation, is there.', 'Therefore, approach issues with the stance of the designer: construct, in imagination assisted by concrete representation, ways to intervene in the world for the better. More specifically, choose a client, a locus of action and a form of intervention; use static or dynamic simulations to indicate how the setting will react to your intervention; gather information and make analyses (but limit the scale to the smallest allowed by your setting) to shape the details of your contemplated intervention; modify, adjust, and refine repeatedly, evaluating effects at each round. Assume few limits at the start, and use the iterative process of modifying and evaluating to teach you which real limits exist and how to cope with them. When the right balance of timeliness and effectiveness presents itself, follow Samuel Mockbee\'s advice: \"Proceed and be bold.\"', NULL, 797, 775, '2006-10-22 10:43:58', '2006-10-20 14:49:54', NULL, NULL, 'Evergreen State College', NULL, 360, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(254, 244, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'As local &mdash; as well as global &mdash; problems become more numerous and more intractable, people and <em>groups</em> of people are working together to take appropriate action to address these urgent problems. Unfortunately, the increasing size and complexity of these problems and the corresponding \"appropriate actions\" that are required introduce a set of thorny issues that must be addressed for these actions to be effective.', 'This pattern can be used in situations where a distributed, diverse, dynamic group of people are working towards complementary goals in complex, collaborative efforts.', 'The ability of people to form effective \"Open Action and Research Networks\" is critical to the success of any attempt at significant social and environmental amelioration. It is also an approach that is only now being explored. For that reason, the concept &mdash; and this pattern &mdash; reflect the uncertainty and ambiguity that is inherent in the situation. \r\n\r\nAs we have said before, most of the daunting problems that we face today are large and complex. Grappling with large and complex problems is invariably best served when addressed by many people working together.  Indeed this is often the case as each \"stakeholder\" in any situation can be said to be \"working\" on the problem. Yet each person and organization working on the problem has a unique orientation which can be at odds with others. \"Orientation\" is a broad term that includes reward structures; goals, tactics, and strategies; areas of interests; obligations and allegiances; values and norms, status, legitimacy, and power; and ultimately, the very language that the community uses to discuss the issues. Consider, for example, the wide range of people who are working to minimize the negative effects of global climate change, or what Margaret Keck calls an \"ecology of agents.\"  These people include scientists, activists, inventers,  green business people, educators, politicians, and ordinary people among others, and these people are as often as not members of other organizations and networks with diverse goals and varying resources and abilities to influence others. \r\n\r\nIt is against and within this complex environment that the stakeholder players must act / interact. This diverse group of people &mdash; of continually shifting size, shape, orientation and <i>modus operandi</i> &mdash; can scarcely be called a \"team\" since teams (particularly in sports) have a single objective. It is clear that many of the \"players\" working in these new \"open networks\" have similar objectives, working for example, for social and environmental ameliorization, and these players will come from a multitude of communities: some are interested in research, some action, some the creation of policy, some physical or material changes right now, while others are interested in abstract goals to be attained in the indeterminate future. In the worst case, the diversity of the players destroys the team. Ideally the diversity is the source of its strength. (Indeed diversity of thinking is essential to effective strategy [See <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=503\">Strategic Capacity</a> pattern].) \r\n\r\nAccording to Ganz, \"the task of devising strategy in complex, changing environments may require interaction among team members like the performance of a jazz ensemble. As a kind of distributed cognition, it may require synthesizing skills and information beyond the ken of any one individual, making terms of that interaction particularly important.\" Nearly opposite to the \"ensemble\" idea is the impossible vision of \"herding cats\" in which each \"cat\" is totally unconcerned about the doings of the other \"cats.\"\r\n\r\nThe networks that this pattern must address vary tremendously. At one end of the scale there are networks with few members and resources, short duration, and informal procedures. At the other end are networks like the LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) Network that was started in 1980, involves 26 sites in the US, and over 1,800 scientists and students. Although the LTER Network is fairly well financed (by the National Science Foundation) and is more formal and less diverse than some groups, the networks on both ends of the scale do share many points in common befitting their structure as <I>networks of semi-autonomous peers</I>. \r\n\r\nSome of the questions that this \"network approach\" should ultimately address are as follows: <ul><li>How can differences of opinion be \"managed\" &mdash; i.e. encouraged to some degree, while not allowing them to become destructive?</li><li>How is coordination and cooperation accomplished without coercion? </li><li> How can we cooperatively evolve useful modes of organization and engagement that are especially suited for these new environments and ensembles?</li><li>How can people maintain respect for allies who have other perspectives and capitalize effectively on the diversity of the ensemble? </li><li>How do efforts survive personnel change by ensuring that relevant information, including facts, lessons learned and intriguing opportunities are made available to new members? <li>How can environmental scientists and other types of researchers (including social scientists) conduct research that meets the demands of their profession and the needs of the communities they are working with?</li><li>How  are conflicts and misunderstandings over short-term and long-term goal reconciled?</li></ul>Each organizational type (and each organization!) has its own orientation which encompasses its thinking and acting and it is this orientation which is likely to be challenged when working with others. \r\n\r\nShared concerns and principles help bring people together into groups, organizations and networks. Beyond that, however, other things are also critical. The individuals within the network should be able to work with other people to solve problems collectively and to help maintain cordiality and integrity within the group. Also because the membership of these networks is dynamic, there must be ways to bring in new members easily. Besides shared values and shared ideas about the roles, interests and constraints of the other players, there should be shared goals. Goals and other forms of collective, documented statements or plans, <i>however symbolic they might be</i> can provide coherence over time. \r\n\r\nMargaret Keck\'s work in Brazil provides an excellent example of the power that these documents can have. In 1971, the Solu&ccedil;&atilde;ao Integrada (Integrated Solution) was included as the sanitation component of the metropolitan development plan. Although it was abandoned by the following government and replaced by a more expensive, less popular and more environmentally degrading plan called SANEGRAN. According to Keck, the very existence of the plan made it \"possible for non-technical social and political actors to challenge public authority on water policy.\" In fact, in more striking terms, the plan, \"Like a shadow government existing in counter point to sitting ones, the plan has functioned as a shadow sanitation plan for Sao Paulo for more  than a quarter century, making critical action more possible\" (Keck, 2001). \r\n\r\nGirard and Stark (2006) point out the importance of agreeing on general philosophical aims among disparate groups without descending into micromanagement or debate. Sharing of ideas, documents and information was the also general aim of the Telecommunications Policy Roundtable, that met monthly in Washington, DC, in the 1990s to help build a general  public interest policy for the Internet and other informaiton technologies. The LTER Network, as a body of researchers, places data in a central postion for their work and has developed specific formats to encourage the develop and sharing of data as well as policies for its use in a loosely coupled network configuration (Karasti and Syrj&auml;nen, 2004). \r\n\r\nToday\'s phenomenon of creating movies with a team that was assembled for the purpose of making a single movie is instructive.

Most of these economic indexes express return only in monetary format and risk is calculated on the standard deviation of this monetary expression.  These economic indexes need to also include information that makes life worth living, natural and social capital (living capital), so non-monetary rewards are also included in the standard deviation and risks to human well being can be indicated more accurately.', 'Trading on the benchmark of indices has become increasingly popular over the last few years.  As indexes become more widely used than ever before they become easy indicators, for those they benefit, in measuring how our world is doing, according to them, and skew the honest reality for mankind that we hope to protect.  It is imperative to accurately measure the well being of nations, corporations, individual people, and societies through indexes that adequately reflect the true costs and benefits contributing to the well being of our world.', 'Indexes take on a market theory notion that the efficient frontier has all the information needed to calculate an accurate return (reward) versus risk (cost) index.  Following this notion is the idea that filtering the market for certain criteria of a specialized index lowers the amount of return received for risk taken, because filtered information is inefficient.  This raises questions about the efficiency of markets because active managers filter economic information everyday to create specialized portfolios to increase return.  On this, it would theoretically stand that an index measuring the well being of society could filter for criteria rewarding the common good with little to no ill effect from lack of the so called efficiency imbibed by the market.  \r\n\r\nAround the globe, there is an increase in the number of sustainability and social responsibility indexes (SRI).  These indexes came out of first generation socially conscious investing that excluded corporate stock from investment portfolios on the basis of particular activities deemed to be unethical.  From this, a second generation has emerged and the focus of SRI has changed primarily to identifying social and environmental issues that are material to business performance.  This is an increased attempt by companies to assess the materiality of sustainability issues on (stock) value creation.  These indices paint a picture that socially responsibility is only important when a financial gain is made by corporations or stockholders.  This is not exactly what we are looking for when we hope to use indexes to help measure the well being of our world.  When individual investors purchase SRI traded securities/indexes they still have to deal with the reality that the costs to living capital are making life less valuable even while their portfolios grow.\r\n\r\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)/Gross National Product (GNP) per capita has most lately been used as an index of standard of living in an economy.  GDP/GNP only measures the populations ease in satisfying their material wants (an index of reward for risk taken) and all else that contributes to the sustainability of people and the environment is lost.  \"Adding up the monetary transactions in an economy and calling this prosperity obscures an honest account of the well being of nations.\" (Anielski, 2000)  \r\n\r\nQuality of life and standard of living should not be separate measurements in an index   \"A more complex index of standard of living than GDP must be employed to take into account not only the material standard of living but also other factors that contribute to human well-being such as leisure, safety, cultural resources, social life, mental health, and enironmental quality issues, to name a few.\" (Anielski, 2000)  \r\n\r\nSimon Kuznets\' idea [in] favour of more inclusive measures, less dependent on markets...\"  (Anielski, 2000) rings true as a more realistic approach to well-being.  \"The eventual solution would obviously lie in devising a single yardstick of both economies [virtual wealth  money,debt, stock markets; and real wealth  human, natural and social capital]that would perhaps lie outside the different economic and social institutions and be grounded in experimental science (of nutrition, warmth, health, shelter, etc.).\" (Anielski, 2000)  The business for this millennium is to take up this empirical economic challenge for a single bottom line index for national well-being.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) and its predecessor, the Index for Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) provide the basis for developing a new accountancy to address Kuznets challenge.

First developed by Clifford W. Cobb, GPI/ISEW remains one of the most important attempts to measure sustainable current welfare.\" (Anielski, 2000)   \r\n\r\n\"The GPI adds a cost side to the growth ledger, begins to account for the aspects of the economy that lie outside the realm of monetary exchange, acknowledges that the economy exists for future generations as well as for the present one and adjusts for income disparities.  The GPI begins with personal consumption expenditures as a baseline, the way the GDP does.  Personal spending by households makes up roughly 65 percent of the US GDP.  The GPI then make a series of 24 adjustments for unaccounted benefits, depreciation costs (for social and natural capital) and deducts regrettable social and environmental expenditures.  Specific elements of the GPI include personal consumer expenditures, income, value and cost of consumer spending on durable goods and household capital, cost of household pollution abatement, cost of commuting, cost of crime, cost of automobile accidents, cost of family breakdown, value of housework and parenting, value of voluntary work, loss of leisure time, services of streets and highways, cost of underemployment, air pollution, ozone depletion, water pollution, noise pollution, cost of depletion of non renewable, loss of forests, long term environmental damage, loss of wetlands, net capital investment, net foreign lending/borrowing.\" (Anielski, 2000)  The GPI has also set goals for itself \"to improve its framework in the areas of human capital, technology, government spending, social infrastructure, natural capital and environmental accounts, ecological carrying capacity, genetic diversity, water projects, workplace environment, underground economy, and pollution and lifestyle induced disease.\" (Anielski, 2000)   \r\n\r\nThe results of the GPI reveal that \"well being has declined while virtual wealth (debt, stock markets) have grown exponentially.

This might be about local environmental quality, promoting international respect for human rights, basic needs such as clean- water or nutrition, or access to opportunities, in a neighbourhood, city or country.

The image above is based on the Green Apple Map of New York City http://www.greenapplemap.org\r\n\r\nExamples of using maps in this way include: Green Maps (www.greenmap.org) of cities which can show information about local open space, green transport options, pollution problems, renewable resources, sustainable or fair-trade businesses, or cultural facilities; the State of the World Atlas (Kidron et al., 2003) which includes a large set of global maps covering topics such as political systems, transnationals, climate change, biodiversity, human rights, war and peace, malnutrition and life-expectancy; locally produced maps such as the Sheffield Food Map (Fletcher et al. 2005), which shows locations of community cafes, healthy and socially responsible eating places, opportunities to grow food, buy seeds or get advice on growing, and places to get advice on healthy nutrition, cooking and health. \r\n\r\nIt is important that the map is easy for readers to understand. Distinctive icons, graphs and other visual features should be designed to represent the key topics. The Green Maps project (www.greenmap.org) provide a set of icons that can be used for maps concerned with environmental issues. Displaying such icons on a map can make inequalities between different areas easy to see. The image below shows the tip of Manhattan on one of the Green Apple Maps.\r\n\r\nIt may be helpful to make the map available on the Internet, but in giving the information away freely, you need to consider how the funding to keep the map up to date will be sustainable.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the map is seen as a reliable source of information. The project needs to define a clear set of criteria for what is / is not to be included on the map. These criteria should be publicly available. \r\n\r\nThe map also needs to be kept up to date, so the project will need to identify a person or group of people who will be responsible for assessing items against the criteria and revising the map on a regular basis.  On-line versions can be made database driven.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the map is seen as unbiased, the mapping project must be careful to remain independent of political or commercial interests that might be interpreted by a reader as influencing the content.

Simulations can help illuminate these consequences (for example, a simulation of the long-term effects on land use, transportation, and environmental impacts of different choices).  To be compelling and useful, the simulation results should presented in a way that they can be understood and used by a range of interested citizens.  Further, ideally not just the results, but access to running the simulation, should be available to the public, to allow experimentation with alternatives.  To aid in understanding and credibility, the simulation should be constructed in a transparent fashion, so that its operation is open to inspection and discussion.', 'This pattern is potentially useful to advocacy groups, other community organizations, business associations, and local and regional governments.  Using this pattern depends on a suitable simulation and data being available.  Another factor (less important but useful) would be the existence of a community indicators program that tracks current trends using indicators, so that the *same* indicators can be used to both track current trends and to present the simulation results.  (Doing this is particularly useful in applying the Reality Check pattern [link to Reality Check pattern], in which simulation results are compared with observed, real-world data.', 'Community Indicators [link to Community and Civic Indicators pattern] can provide an important tool for monitoring current trends in a community.  However, we will usually be interested in the values of these indicators in the future, not just the present - and which actions will result in more desirable outcomes as measured by the community indicators.  Simulation and modeling can provide a powerful tool for informing such discussions, particularly if the results from the simulation can be presented using the same indicators as selected in a participatory Community and Civic Indicators project.  For example, the summary graphic for this pattern shows the population densities in the Puget Sound region in Washington State in 2025 given the current land use and transportation plans, as projected by the UrbanSim simulation system.\r\n\r\nThe results of the work should be made available using the web or printed reports.  Using the web has the advantage that definitions of indicators, documentation, and related information can be conveniently linked together.\r\n\r\nSupporting public access to running the simulation, as well as the results, might be provided in several different ways, depending on the complexity and size of the simulation and input data.  Particularly for complex simulations, with substantial data requirements, accessing a simulation hosted on a server via a web interface is a good technique.  Smaller simulations might be downloaded and run on individual\'s computers.\r\n\r\nThis is in general not an easy pattern to use.  In addition to developing the set of indicators (including careful definitions and documentation), a simulation of the phenomenon of interest must exist or be developed, including the necessary data and calibration to apply it in the given community.  For the example used here (land use and transportation), this typically requires that the local or regional government agency in charge of land use and transportation planning either undertake the simulation work itself, or be willing to work closely with another organization that does so.\r\n\r\nThe game SimCity demonstrates that many people -- including grade school children -- can be highly engaged by what might have been thought to be a dry topic, namely urban planning.  While games such as SimCity can provide valuable inspiration and interaction ideas, there are key differences between such games and the simulations suggested in this pattern.  First, this pattern is concerned with producing simulations of actual phenomena, for example, simulating a specific, real, urban area, with the intent of producing useful forecasts of its long-term development to inform public deliberation and debate.  Second, the interaction techniques available to its users should expose only the actions and \"policy levers\" available to real citizens and governments (for the urban simulation example, such as building light rail systems or changing zoning).  Users of these simulations can\'t simply declare that an area will be redeveloped (or bring in Godzilla); rather, all they can do is change relevant policies in a scenario in hopes of influencing people in the simulated environment to redevelop the area and residents to move there.\r\n\r\nPotential challenges to the result include challenges to the accuracy and reliability of the simulation.', 'Develop a simulation of the system of interest (for example, of urban land use and transportation), and make the results of the simulation accessible to interested stakeholders using indicators.

At the same time, this metaphor is often taken to imply a problematic solution: the one-way bridge. The one-way bridge sees a technology-rich side at one end, and a technology-poor side at the other end. The one-way bridge attempts to bring gadgets to a place of absense, a sort of technology vacuum. This view can have the unfortunate side-effect of making local knowledge and expertise invisible or de-valued.', 'One of the alternative approaches which avoids the one-way assumption is that of Culturally Situated Design Tools: using computer simulations of cultural arts and other pracitces to \"translate\" from local knowledge to their high-tech counterparts in mathematics, computer graphics, architecture, agriculture, medicine, and science. Current design tools include a virtual bead loom for simulating Native American beadwork, a tool based on urban graffiti, an audio tool for simulating Latino percussion rhythms, a Yupik navigation simulation, etc. Each design tools makes use of the mathematics embedded in the practive--for example the virtual bead loom uses Cartesian coordinates, because of the four-fold symmetry of the traditional loom (and many other Native American designs such as the \"four winds\" healing traditions, the four-pole tipi, etc). Applications are primarily in K-12 math education, but they also can be applied to design projects such as architecture, or used as a research tool in investigations such as ethnomathematics.', 'Although we have had some strong success with these tools, their deployment--particularly in the field of education--has not been easy. In the educational context, we first have to work with community members to find a cultural practice that can be simulated. In the case of Native American practices some of the best examples in terms of ethnomathematics turn out to be sacred practices that cannot be simulated (eg Navajo sand painting, Shoshone whirling disks). Second, we have to make sure the cultural practice is recognized by the youth -- several African examples were questioned because by teachers who said African American children would see them more as dusty museum artifacts than as something they had cultural ownership of. Third we have to satisfy the requirements of standard curricula -- many interesting examples of ethnomathematics (Eulerian paths in pacific Islander sand drawings, fractals in African architecture, etc.) are difficult to use because they are outside of the standard curriculum. Fourth the software support must be easy for teachers to use -- many math teachers (particularly those serving large minority populations) do not have ready access to good quality computers for their students, and do not have good technolgical training. The students must be provided with cultural background information and tutorials, and the teachers must be provided with lesson plans and examples of use.', 'Our first design tool was developed for the \"African Fractals\" project (Eglash 1999). Mathematics teachers with large African American student populations reported that they could not use fractals -- there was too much pressure to conform to the standard curriculum -- and that they felt that many of the examples were too culturally distant from the students. They all felt that the examples of hairstyles would work well however. Thus our first tool focused on the hairstyles, and used the term \"iterative transformational geometry\" rather than \"fractals.\"  The graphic above shows the result, called \"Cornrow Curves.\" \r\n\r\nEach braid is represented as multiple copies of a Y shaped plait. In each iteration, the plait is copied, and a transformation is applied. The series of transformed copies creates the braid. In the above example, we can see the original style at top right, and a series of braid simulations, each composed of plait copies that are successively scaled down, rotated, and translated (reflection is only applied to whole braids, as in the case where one side of the head is a mirror image of the other). One of the interesting research outcomes was that our students discovered which parameters need to remain the same and which would be changed in order to produce the entire series of braids (that is, how to iterate the iterations).\r\n\r\nThe cultural background section of the website is divided into how to (for those unfamiliar with the actual process of creating cornrow hairstyles) and an extensive cultural history of cornrow hairstyles. We have found that many students, even those of African American heritage, will tell us that cornrows were invented in the 1960s. The history section was developed to provide students with a more accurate understanding of that history, starting with their original context in Africa (where they were used to signify age, religion, ethnic group, social status, kinship, and many other meanings), the use of cornrows in resistance to the attempt at cultural erasure during slavery, their revival during the civil rights era, and their renaissance in hip-hop. Most importantly, we want students to realize that the cornrows are part of a broader range of scaling designs from Africa (Eglash 1999), and that they represent a part of this African mathematical heritage that survived the middle passage. \r\n\r\nAs noted previously, we have since developed a wide variety of design tools, ranging from simulations of Mayan pyramids (see image below) to virtual baskets. Our evaluations have been based on pre-test/post-test comparisons of mathematics performance, average grades in mathematics classes (comparing a year with the tools to the previous year without), and scores on a survey of interest or engagement with IT (specifically computing careers). All three measures show statistically significant increase (p < .05 or better) with use of these tools. \r\n\r\nIn summary, we note that any attempts to re-value local or traditional knowledge in the face of oppressive histories will be challenging, and all the more so if the re-valuation has to compete with current mainstream global practices. But we feel that Culturally Situated Design Tools offer an important new position in which to engage that struggle.', NULL, 494, 439, '2005-08-03 13:45:40', '2006-09-27 21:27:50', NULL, NULL, 'rpi', NULL, 306, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(259, 249, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'As Herb Simon pointed out in the \"Architecture of Complexity\", a common heuristic for dealing with complexity is to break complex problems into smaller, more or less independent components.  When a complex organization is broken down into smaller units (such as divisions, departments, teams) each unit specializes.  People are selected, trained, and motivated to optimize the performance of that unit.  However, there remains the necessity for coordinating across units to deal with changes, exceptions, and errors in organizational design. In these cases, it is necessary for human beings to solve problems across organizational boundaries.  However, since people in different organizations have been selected, trained, and motivated differently, such conversations are often very difficult.', 'Context: Organizations strive to become more efficient partly through automation and partly through specialization of function. Organizations train one group of people to perform a function and then \"hand off\" the process to another group trained to perform another function, etc. \r\nIntegration often extends across formal organizational boundaries so that; e.g., various participants in supply chains attempt to coordinate their efforts.  Such larger scale integration can result in greater efficiency.\r\n \r\nSystems are not designed, however, with complete knowledge of every possible contingency. When design assumptions break down, it is important for people on both sides of a functional boundary to have a cooperative conversation in order to solve the problem left by the gap between reality and the design assumptions.', 'Forces:\r\n\r\nMany processes are too complex to be understood in detail by one person.\r\nPerformance on a task is generally a logarithmic function of time on task.\r\nA person\'s time is limited.\r\nComplex systems are typically designed and built by decomposition. \r\nSystems to automate, semi-automate, or coordinate are generally designed by people who are not the people who actually do the tasks.\r\nDesigns can never anticipate all contingencies.\r\nHuman beings can negotiate to solve novel coordination problems via conversation.\r\nPeople find conversation in the service of finding and solving problems rewarding.\r\nPeople are subject to forming \"in-groups\" and \"out-groups.\" \r\nIf \"in-groups\" and \"out-groups\" are formed, rather than negotiating a solution to a problem that is globally optimal, each group will try to \"win\" by forcing the solution that is optimal for their subfunction.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nHistorically, many organizations have recognized the need for such informal conversational ties and have provided both special places (Officer\'s Club; Traditional Pub; Company Cafeterias) and events (Company Picnics; Religious Retreats; Holiday Parties; Clubs) to facilitate such interchanges.  As organizations attempt integration across ever wider scales however, providing appropriate venues becomes increasingly challenging.\r\nIn some cases, two related functions report to a single manager and the manager may serve as a communication bridge.  Clearly, however, in complex organizations, formal management methods alone will be insufficient for coordination across all the boundaries. \r\nWhen links in a processing chain do not converse, inefficiency results.  For example, telecommunications company Customer Service Reps gave out credit card numbers to business customers.  However, they had to get these numbers from the accounting department.  The customer service reps were only allowed to make outbound calls between 12 and 1.  The accounting department generally had lunch between 12 and 1.  As a result, it was often many days before customers were able to begin using their business accounts.  The accounting department and the customer service reps also disliked each other, had no informal contact, and when other coordination problems arose, generally blamed each other.  \r\n\r\nThe same general difficulty arises in attempting to deal with any complex problem; e.g., attempting to voluntarily and democratically facilitate social change.  For instance, in the pattern, \"Community of Communities\" it is possible for various communities to develop plans that inadvertently interfer with each other.  That is why it is useful, on a regular basis, to have conversations that cross community boundaries.\r\n\r\nAt IBM Research, I used to play a lot of tennis with other IBMers including an inter-company league.  Here, I met someone in the corporate tax department named Frank. \r\nI also used a system which returned the abstracts of scientific and technical articles that contained key-words of interest.  Such systems return many false positives.  One in particular had nothing whatever to do with my interests; it was about a new federal program that allowed highly profitable companies to trade tax credits with companies that were losing money.  Instead of throwing this in the trash, because I had had conversations with Frank, I forwarded him the abstract. He looked into this program and saved a lot of money for IBM. This case illustrates that ideally even  people with no obvious process connection should be able to converse informally. \r\nIn planning the first Universal Usability Conference (ACM SIGCHI), it was necessary to delegate various functions to various parties.  We attempted to plan ahead of time by standard tools such as budgets and project timelines.  A weekly conference call proved crucial in allowing us to identify and solve unanticipated problems effectively and efficiently.  \r\nIn WorldJam (an on-line 3 day company-wide electronic meeting for all IBMers), moderators and facilitators used Babble (an electronic blended synchronous/asynchonous chat) and Sametime (a synchronous chat system) as backchannels to collectively solve problems and coordinate information among jam topics.\r\nIn Hanna Pavillion, a children\'s psychiatric hospital, each change of shift is marked by a short joint staff meeting in which critical issues are discussed so that a continuity of knowledge persists across shift boundaries (common in most medical settings).  In addition, at least some people work double or rotating shifts and get to know people from various shifts.  There are ample opportunties for informal conversation during the day as well as special outings.  Then, staff members can coordinate treatment for a specific child across the boundaries of profession and shift.\r\n\r\nAdditional Reviewers/Editors: Catalina Danis, Alison Lee, David Ing, Ian Simmonds\r\nImage of Babble courtesty of: \"Visual by www.PDImages.com\"', 'At a minimum, Time, Space, and Means as well as Motivation must be provided for people who need to coordinate acoss units to carry on continuing informal conversation.

Commission hearing rooms offer a forum for contact across previously insurmountable barriers of hostility, which can inspire a traditional enemies to build a newly shared investment in the future.', 'Community organizations dealing with local traumatic events, families with a personal story of injustice, even an entity as large as the United States with its dark history of slavery can consider creating a Truth, Reconciliation and Amnesty Commission. A Commission holding hearings will allow the actual history to be revealed by taking testimony from a wide variety of perspectives, and will also become a forum in which adversaries can approach each other without insisting on punishment or revenge. Perhaps surprisingly, a narrative, anecdotal yet full recounting of painful truth contributes substantially to restoring the harmony and vitality of the community for the future.\r\n\r\nSouth Africas is the most famous Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but there have been dozens of others.Many have played an important role in repairing community rifts without furthering the suffering for most people. In South Africa, an indigenously inspired and funded project, heard thousands of testimonies and disposed of over 3000 requests for amnesty. Guatemalas TRC was more centralized and UN sponsored. A key outcome of the latters work came in an apology from the United States for its abusive interventions Guatemalan affairs. \r\n\r\nTRCs offer a substitute for traditional disaster adjudication systems, which usually take one of the following three forms: insurance payments/liability law suits, government investigations/hearings, criminal trials and punishments. While each of these has its place, all three are concerned above all with blame for the past. Furthermore, legal and official procedures traditionally depend on arcane jargon and they tend to be expensive, long drawn out and highly centralized. Since they are dominated by experts, traditional dispute forums tend to marginalize the ordinary people who actually experience traumatic events. UN War Crimes Tribunals for Rwanda and Bosnia, which refuse to consider amnesty, have been bedeviled by the failings of court-based systems.\r\n\r\nTRC style hearings are quite different. They are relatively informal so they are commensurately cheaper and can take place anywhere in an affected area. If they follow the South African model, hearings are not adversarial, they do not assign guilt or innocence and they are carried out in the local, natural language. In 2004 in Greensboro NC, hearings about 1979 slaughter of four civil rights activists offered an opportunity for people to continue on with a process that had actually been cut off in the courts. \r\n\r\nTRC Commissioners need to attend openheartedly to the voices of suffering, to ask probing questions about responsibility and action so as to determine if the truth has indeed been told. Their success depends on the integrity of these commissioners. It also depends on careful recording and distribution of the testimonies. Participation, both for witnesses and those accused of doing harm has traditionally been voluntary, in the sense that no-one faces additional legal sanctions from their society for failing to appear, though community hostility can be hard on those who reject the Commissions request to appear.\r\n\r\nThe strongest argument against TRC proceedings is precisely the strongest argument in favor of them  that such hearings are not the forum for punishing a perpetrator. Victim opponents of TRCs fear being deprived of justice. Perpetrators worry that the hearings are merely fishing expeditions to search out the guilty who will then be punished. Theorists are concerned that perpetrators who are not prosecuted under such a system will find they can act with impunity In South Africa some victims remained critical to the end, but many discovered that the new knowledge they gleaned at the hearings about what happened and why proved much stronger in easing their hearts than the had expected. And nothing about these hearings need prevent judicial action. Indeed in recent years there have been examples of re-opening judicial proceedings with a similar intent, for example the 2005 recreation and new trial of Chief Leshi leading his exoneration in Washington State, a hundred years after his execution.\r\n\r\nEstablishing a successful commission depends on preparing the groundwork on many issues. The factors identified by the Truth Commission Project (see below) include\r\n# By whom/under whose name the commission is established\r\n# When the commission is established and how far back it reaches \r\n# Prevailing focus on healing or justice\r\n# Public support for a truth commission\r\n# Geographic horizon for Investigation\r\n# Legal Powers of Investigation\r\n# Rejecting anonymous and confidential testimonies\r\n# Visibility of Hearings\r\n# Degree of Formality of Hearings\r\n# Whether or not to offer Amnesty\r\n#  Completion, Publication and Distribution/ Accessibilityof report\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile most actual TRC hearings have been conducted in former war zones, it is easy to discern other issues which could benefit from this process: \r\n\r\n1) The United States government and the American people could people re-examine the costs of the slave trade and the centuries of slave labor and yet minimize the likelihood that the acknowledgement of history becomes the basis furious revenge.\r\n2) Or the people and the different levels of government could investigate the events of the New Orleans 2005 catastrophe without focusing narrowly on blame and thereby prompting an onslaught of liability law suits.\r\n3) Or the residents and former residents of Hanford-Washington, Chernobyl-Ukraine, and Ukraine, and Bikini Island and other nuclear sites could craft public history out of the secrecy which surrounded the nuclear programs of the 20th century. At the same time they would create a forum for dialogue with the builders of the weapons and power plants who have left behind a radioactive legacy that will last for millennia.\r\n\r\nThis pattern links to Memory and Responsibility, Witnessing, Transparency, Community Inquiry, International Law', 'Therefore, faced with a festering historical trauma in a specific community, create a Truth, Reconciliation and Amnesty commission, using either informal or official channels. A commission can hear victim testimonies about past suffering as well as explanations from those responsible and it can provide a forum in which adversaries can meet without fear of further harm or punishment.', NULL, 528, 430, '2006-10-04 09:54:33', '2006-10-03 22:30:53', NULL, NULL, 'The Evergreen State College', NULL, 338, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Also, without structure, a discussion can become random and rambling. It can be dominated by powerful individuals or other factors. The emergence of these negative group dynamics can adversely impact the ability of the group to achieve it\'s shared objectives. Other factors, such as distance to the meeting, inconvenient scheduling, or costs of getting to the meeting can obstruct effective and inclusive participation. Current online systems don\'t provide the structure that groups of people engaging in deliberative meetings or discussions need to help them efficiently move through a decision making process that is accessible and ensures equal participation by all.', 'Board meetings, committee meetings, administrative panels, review boards, volunteer organizations, non-profit community groups.', 'Everyday conversation, though often purposeful, is informal; it doesn\'t rely on an agenda, defined  roles, or precisely delineated rules of interacton. To overcome the unpredictabilty of this type of human interaction, systematic rules have been created to facilitate purposeful group meetings whose objective is to produce collective decisions. One of the earliest set of \"parliamentary procedures\" was formulated in 1876 by Henry Robert in a treatise entitled \"Roberts Rules of Order\". \"Roberts Rules\", as they have come to be known, have been widely adopted as a means to fairly and equitably conduct the business of group meetings and provide a method to ensure that all parties within the group have the opportunity to participate in the decision making process. At the same time Roberts Rules ensure that no minority interest can exert undue influence on the process. \r\n\r\nThe advent of the Internet has provided an opportunity to combine the democratic principles (such as Roberts Rules of Order), with modern interactive communication technologies, to provide new web-based meeting facilitation systems. Ideally, online deliberations systems would allow people to come together as peers in an \"on-line\" environment and conduct \"official\" business meetings without being present in the same physical location. The plethora of online <i>discussion</i> systems, especially when contrasted to the scarcity of deliberative systems suggests the difficulty of this enterprise.\r\n\r\nWhile working in and with a team of students at The Evergreen State College the authors of this pattern were involved in the development of <i><a href=\" http://trout.cpsr.org/program/sphere/e-liberate/about.php\">e-Liberate</a></i> a working prototype devloped using Linux, MySql, Apache, and PHP. The application provides facilities to create groups and to create and schedule meetings. Then, using written (typed) rather than spoken input, the system facilitates meeting by coordinating user interactions (such as making motions), conducting and tallying votes, and providing an archive facility for official minutes.\r\n\r\nOnline deliberation substitutes one set of advantages and disadvantages for the set that face-to-face deliberation offers. In general the broad criteria of either approach include access to the process, efficacy of the process (including individual involvement and process as a whole, and the context (including legal requirements, etc.). Of course these criteria overlap to some degree and influence each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough face-to-face deliberation is basically \"low-tech,\" physically getting to meetings may involve costly, \"high-tech\" travel. Then, once physically present at a face-to-face meeting, effective participation depends on the skills (including, for example, how to use Roberts Rules of Order), intentions and knowledge of the individuals. It also depends (of course!) on the skills, intentions and knowledge of the other participants in the meeting &mdash; including the chair. \r\n\r\nBy making access to a computer (connected to the Internet) a prerequisite to participation online deliberation adds an access hurdle comprised of cost, geography, and computer fluency. Depending on the characteristics of the potential attendees this barrier may be more than offset by the <i>advantages</i> that online deliberations could provide. If, for example, the meeting attendees are drawn from western Europe and the United States, it is likely the case that costs associated with computer communication will be less than transportation costs. As a matter of fact, online deliberation makes the prospect of more-or-less synchronous discussions / deliberations among people  <i>around the world</i> possible, although here the tyranny of time zones and humankind\'s intrinsic circadian rhythms (which encourage us to sleep at night and stay awake in the daylight hours) become a mitigating factor: making decisions while many of the attendees are sleeping is one formula for dysfunctional meetings. The very fact that worldwide meetings become possible however provides an enormously fertile ground for civil society opportunities. (See, for example, the World Citizen Parliament pattern.) \r\n\r\nKnowledge of the topics under discussion, knowledge of the process (Roberts Rules of Order, for example) and command of the language(s) being used in the discussion can also be obstacles to effective and equitable face-to-face as well online deliberation. Online environments, however, have the potential of alleviating, at least to some degree, some of the disadvantages that seem to be intrinsic to face-to-face settings. In the e-Liberate example mentioned above attendees can select a \"language pack\" so that the appropriate Roberts Rules process word or phrase (such as \"I second the motion\") will be presented in the attendee\'s own language. Note that this is not machine (\"on-the-fly\") translation. Moreover it has no bearing whatsoever on the <i>content</i> of the meeting &mdash; what the participants actually contributed &mdash; it determines only which of several equivalent language sets of the Roberts Rules \"meta-language\" is displayed to each user. The possibility for automatic \"machine translation\" to be put to work on all attendee input so that attendee only saw input to the meeting in their own language. Of course machine translation is imperfect at best &mdash; and may always remain so. Try, for example, transforming some verbiage into another language and back again via a machine translation system on the web. The result generally bears no resemblance to the original. On the other hand, translation by humans is not perfect either; relying as it does on the skills of the human translator. For those reasons it may be well-advised for reasons of transparency and integrity of the process to make both (or all) original and machine-translated language versions available for inspection with the other meeting contributions in the database. (Today as I write this a transcript of an interview with me appeared in a Sao Paulo newspaper: my utterance \"couldn\'t\" was transcribed as \"could\" &mdash; an easy mistake that totally inverts the meaning!) So, while free and reliable electronic translation is desirable, high-quality human translation could be inserted into the process as appropriate. This could only be as \"simultaneous\" and as accurate as the skills and availability of the human translator interposed within the process would allow. The needs discussed above for multiple versions and for long-term storage are appropriate in the case of human translation as well. \r\n\r\nThe online environment offers other potential advantages. One obvious benefit is that only the actions that are allowable within the deliberation process at that time are displayed to the individual participants. This, in theory, can help reduce problems that are commonplace with meeting attendees who are not thoroughly familiar with the Roberts Rules conventions). Online systems can also provide onliine \"help systems.\" Within e-Liberate, for example, users can view descriptions of how and when specific actions are used. Also, as previously mentioned, a meeting transcript can be automatically created and votes can automatically be tabulated as well. \r\n\r\n<b>Notes:</b> <ul><li>Of course deliberation is an ongoing process &mdash; not just a sporadic occurrence.

Under oppressive regimes, the circulation of information, literature, and other art forms can be dangerous. People can be harassed, beaten-up, imprisoned or even executed for possession of forbidden information &mdash; or the means to create, reproduce or distribute it. Journalists face even greater challenges and require an extensive collection of techniques to get the news out to all who need it.', 'This pattern focuses on journalism during hostile conditions in which citizens have a greater need to engage with the forbidden knowledge and share it with members of their community. The future of reform often depends on the success of this collaboration between journalists and citizens. The ideas in this pattern (including new distribution practices, for example) also can be used in the US or other countries that have a nominally free press yet one that is dominated by a few strong voices with deep pockets.', 'The world can be very hostile to independent and alternative journalists and to people who read and think.  Even countries where there are no legal restrictions to a \"free\" press have major problems. The journal <i>Index on Censorship</i> and the organization <i>Reporters without Borders</i> regularly report on the barbarities visited upon journalists worldwide. Despots know that the truth can damage their reputations and ultimately their regime.  Although the truth is difficult to hide forever, postponing its arrival, limiting its exposure, and casting aspersions on its accuracy may be adequate for their purposes. \r\n\r\nA hostile environment is one in which coercion or force &mdash; either formally through laws and police &mdash; or informally through thugs or contract killers is employed to stifle the free flow of ideas. The most common form of choking off the flow of information that could be damaging to the government, corporations or wealthy individuals is <i>distraction.</i> Serbian media during the Milosevic years with its breezy lightweight confections of schmaltzy pop as well as nationalist songs and slapstick served up in many cases by scantily clad women, provides a good example of this. \r\n\r\nOne appendage of the unfree press (at least as conceptualized in the U.S.) is a ruthlessly efficient secret police that stomps out every aspect of alternative point-of-view the instant that it surfaces. This modus operandi seems to be uncommon in practice (and would no doubt be the envy of all the despots). The defenders of the status quo, though loutish and dangerous, are often capricious and incompetent, and they are generally stymied by insufficient resources. The ambiguity of the laws and the ambiguity of the presumed offenses also can work in favor of the journalist. \r\n\r\nThe former Soviet Union and its satellites provided the fertile soil for an independent press that operated on the margins of the law for several decades. This is the classic \"samizdat\" distribution in which readers painstakingly and secretly copied by hand or via typewriter and carbon paper, multiple copies of entire books which were then passed on to others who would do the same. \r\n\r\nIn the \"developed world\" journalists and other media workers are specialized: one person intones the news of the day, using video clips that another person edited which was shot by another person during an interview conducted by another person as ordered by another person.  When the political climate turns nasty and journalists are beaten-up, threatened or killed by government soldiers, paramilitary troops or thugs, when resources dry up or when disaster or wartime situations erupt, journalists habituated to the strict division of labor may be unable to adopt the more flexible and improvisational mode of news production when that becomes necessary.  Journalists with overspecialized, deep but narrow, skills will find that they are unable to respond quickly and flexibly when their tried-and-true practices fail due to unexpected circumstances. \r\n\r\nAlternative news distribution involves a canny cat and mouse game between those who believe in the free distribution of information and those who don\'t. Living within an actively hostile environment, it will be necessary to keep changing the way that business is done to meet new challenges. Unlike journalists in the US or other developed countries, journalists must adept in many modes of reporting, many approaches to distribution, a variety of tactics and strategies and the inventive use of what\'s available to get the job done, as befits what B92 journalist Veran Matic calls a \"universal journalist, not an encyclopedic polymath who is informed in different fields, but a professional familiar with print journalism, radio and television, online journalism and information distribution mechanisms.\" This is what I call a <i>bricoleur-journalist</i> who sends the sounds that accompany the scene at voting station in Africa can go directly over the air via a cell phone with an open line to the radio station. Audio cassettes, printed broadsides or, more commonly today, DVDs can be distributed when the plug is pulled on a radio station (as it was three times during B92\'s early years of confronting Milosevic). And bricoleur-journalists in different cultures and settings, such as Chinese pro-democracy or environmental activists, will assume any number of local variants. \r\n\r\nAn interesting, unexpected issue seems to surface from time-to-time by the underground media (and society in general) after the fall of an oppressive regime. (fate of art and literature)  Ironically, many people who worked closely with clandestine media over the years now feel unsettled in the post-soviet environment. After communism fell the former trickle of information became a tsunami of mostly commercial offerings. When information was scarce and in danger of extinction possessed an almost sacred allure.  Now the same type of information is lost in the flood, just more anonymous flotsam and jetsam in a torrent of images and sounds. \r\n\r\nSamizdat or clandestine journalism doesn\'t always succeed of course. Translating the success of the samizdat or underground press to other regions under oppressive regimes is far from automatic. A potential audience that is interested in the material must exist &mdash; as with the media in any situation &mdash; and there must be some way to get the material to them. Some of these people earnestly want social change and believe there is some degree, however small, of hope that this outcome is achievable. Interestingly, and somewhat contrary to conventional wisdom, some people in the potential audience are motivated by their desire to <i>know</i> the truth whether it helps to actually change the situation or not. At any rate, the larger and more active and supportive the audience is, the more likely that the alternative press will succeed. On the other side of the equation are the journalists &mdash; potential and actually &mdash; and the absence of either audience or journalists can prevent the enterprise from being successful. \r\n\r\nAlthough precarious, alternative media production actually builds civic capacity. According to Anna Husarka who worked for Poland\'s Solidarity Information Bureau in 1989, the journalism they practiced \"was a political blueprint for the democratic struggles that dismantled communism.\" It is also important to note that traditional \"news\" is not the only \"product\" of an alternative media project. The B92 enterprise (which started as a college radio station in Belgrade) now includes Radio B92, Television B92, B92.net (Web site), B92 publishing (books and magazines), B92 music label, B92.Rex cultural centre, B92.concert agency, and B92.communications (Internet provision and satellite links) amply illustrates the rich potential of a \"media\" that chooses to embrace the widest range of outlets. One of their biggest and most successful projects was \"Rock for Vote,\" the biggest rock tour in Serbia\'s history, \"a traveling festival with 6 to 8 bands playing in 25 cities and towns throughout the country.\" The tour was organized while organizers and activists \"were being molested, harassed and detained by the police on a daily basis.\" In spite of that 150,000 citizens attended the concerts. Most importantly the results of the 2000 elections demonstrated that their main objective was attained: \"80% of first-time voters did go to the polls after all ... casting their ballots to bring about fundamental changes in the country.\"\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, some media operations that developed during a period of hostility have had a difficult time making the transition from a post-war or post-oppressive regime. On the other hand, Gazeta Wyborcza, one of Poland\'s leading underground newspapers in the 1980s, which was started in a kindergarten classroom became one of the most influential and commercially viable dailies in Poland [Smillie, 1999].) B92, in least in the immediate aftermath of the troubles in Serbia, continued innovative programming that reflected their terrifying past. For example, they launched a Truth and Reconciliation process that included radio shows and a series of books about the wars (including the Srebrenica crimes) and disintegration of former Yugoslavia. They also convened a conference \"In Search for Truth and Reconciliation\" in 2000 that was attended by journalists, intellectuals and representatives of NGOs from all former Yugoslav republics took part and another conference \"Truth, Responsibility and Reconciliation\" the following year that featured experiences of other countries in similar processes. Radio B92 also set up a special documentation archive on the wars which included testimonies, documentaries, video footage, books and other documents. They also arranged \"exhibitions, screenings of documentaries and public discussions on these topics are being organized throughout Serbia\" (Matic, 2004).', 'Producing &mdash; and consuming &mdash; or other types of cultural or journalistic media with hostile societies can be hazardous to emotional as well as physical health.

Currently intermediaries buy coffee in poor villages for a few coins which is then sold to big companies at great profit. Access to the market depends on knowledge and the technological means to capitalize on it. \r\n\r\nWe know that this is not only a problem for the poor. Many people around the world have problems related to lack of media access. The fact that large corporations control the media becomes a matter of life and death because the media is the de facto gatekeeper of important information related to health and safety. Indigenous people often lack the power, knowledge and technology to produce their own information and their own media. The Internet could provide a new way to communicate. For example, in the south and south-east areas of México, there are new Internet access centers but these are only for people who already know how to use computers and the Internet, knowledge that many indigenous people dont have.\r\n\r\nIndigenous Media simultaneously addresses many needs of marginalized indigenous groups. Thus embracing this pattern entails education and training, policy, resources (time, money, people, for example) in addition to access to the technology itself. An e-mail campaign or a panel discussion on a radio show can help organize a campaign against a group of intermediaries or to denounce bad legislators. In Mexico\'s rural communities such as Chiapas, Guerrero  and Oaxaca radio stations managed by indigenous farmers and satellite gateways to the Internet can make the difference between intimidation and free speech. Some notable examples from around the world include <i>Radio Tambuli Radio Network</i> in the Philippines, the <i>Deadly Mob</i> aboriginal organization of Alice Springs, Australia, and the <i>Koahnic Broadcast Corporation</i> in Alaska.\r\n\r\nNon-indigenous people can play a role in support of this pattern. They can organize training programs in the 3,100 new access points are installed in the municipalities around Mexico and/or in Internet cafes. Many institutions and international agencies whose programs include technology in rural areas can donate equipment, access to the Internet (maybe via satellite gateways), and Internet streaming. NGOs with training and learning programs can work with indigenous farmers and others to learn how to apply media access technology. Mino of the Ashaninka native people in Peru who was instrumental in establishing Internet access for his people stresses that indigenous people must not allow non-indigenous people to monopolize information. For that reason, he and others in his group carefully observed every technical installation that was carried out in his village.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the pattern language and other educational tools are not available in native languages and are useless to most indigenous people. Many of these stakeholders have experience with ICT who can share their stories of success and failure, but they can\'t express their thoughts in English.\r\n\r\nRadio, print media, television, all have potential to help shape public opinion. When rural farmers acquire Internet skills and can access media, they can apply this knowledge to create their own information and communication systems. Ultimately, indigenous people can promote success by communicating with other indigenous people around the world about their experiences.\r\n\r\nRelated patterns: <blockquote><a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=341\">Linguistic Diversity</a><br /><a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=316\">Arts of Resistance</a><br \\><a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=323\">Alternative Media</a><br /><a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=69\">Roles in Media</a><br /><a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=66\">Influencing the Design of Information Technologies</a><br /><a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=21\">Mobile ICT Learning Facilities for 3rd World Communities</a><br /><a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=148\">International Networks of Alternative Media</a><br /><a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=315\">Control of One\'s Representation</a><br /><a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=317\">Solidarity Networks</a><br /><a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=359\">Ordinary Protagonists and Everyday Life</a></blockquote>\r\n\r\nImage from <a href=\"http://facstaff.uww.edu/mohanp/BB_MENU_01.jpg\">http://facstaff.uww.edu/mohanp/BB_MENU_01.jpg</a>', 'Encourage the development of indigenous media that is controlled by indigenous people themselves.

Whether in school history classes or in the allocation of government research and university budgets, the energy devoted to peace studies is commonly so small as to be virtually invisible. \r\nFurthermore, an interest in peace-making is often taken as a sign of weakness. Hence peace education is unattractive to people with power.\r\nOn the largest historical scale there is a strong correlation between the acquisition of the full rights of citizenship and warrior status. Furthermore, the right to command violence and wage war is a core prerogative of governments and political leaders. So peace education is easily defined as anti-government and in many places there is constant pressure to sustain the commitment to patriotic sentiment.', 'The United Nations Peace University in Costa Rica, UNESCO', 'Young people are encountering peace education in a variety of modes:  Volunteer lawyers in Washington and other states teach mediation in the public schools. Community groups working with teenagers in trouble teach straight talk, a system for engaging directly with potential critics. Families too, have a choice between authoritarian parental powers and developing their members\' negotiation skills, although if children are to learn to negotiate, parents must really be willing to change in response to their childs arguments. \r\n\r\nSince peace and justice are intertwined, peace education requires also that the younger generations learn also about achieving justice. Addressing topics relating to economic, ethnic, class, religious and other injustices remains controversial in US public education, but many schools and colleges have begun to open discussion of these issues. \r\n\r\nJapan makes a significant investment in peace education for the young, through a large network of museums and peace sites. Most school programs are focused in on peace as it relates to World War II and indeed some of the facilities Japan describes as peace museums, others might label war museums or memorials. Nonetheless, through the cities and citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan has been a world leader in reminding people of the urgent perils of nuclear weaponry. \r\n\r\nPeace education and peace research are linked and in 1981, under the leadership of Sen. Matsunaga of Hawaii, the US government set up an Institute of Peace. Since the ending of the Cold War, when it became legitimate once again think more about peace, US universities have founded significant programs, including undergraduate studies at Hampshire College, and graduate programs at George Mason University and Antioch. Europe, too, has seen considerable investment in university level education in peace studies and Europeans seem more willing than Americans to take an assertive stance in favor of peace.

Instead these tools go unused or are not properly utilized to maximise their benefits due to a lack of knowledge about their use or more commonly their relavance to peoples needs.', 'Often the simplest and most benign level of technology that can effectively achieve the intended purpose in a particular location will be the most relevant. These Intermediate Technologies are particularly useful to underdeveloped rural areas, which may lack the specialised expertise or infrastructure to operate and maintain high technology.', 'Intermediate technology, as asserted in the book <i>Small is Beautiful</i> by E. F. Schumacher, tends to promote values such as health, beauty and permanence.\r\n\r\nThe idea of intermediate technology or \"appropriate technology\" is meant to highlight an approach to the concrete tools pushed in development practice. For example in a rural area, where literacy is low, where there is a lack of communication lines and even electricity it would not make sense to implement a tele-center to promote information awareness, rather a small local radio station by which people could obtain information through battery operated radios would be much more relevant to transfer information.\r\n\r\nIn essence the role of an intermediate technology is meant to allow peoples to take advantage of technology but in ways that don\'t drastically disrupt the cultural integrity of the community. It is ultimately respectful and mindful, to the fact that a treadle-pump for accessing water over walking 2 miles to the river 5 times a day is going to be more relevant to rural woman raising a household than a computer. In fact, there are no shortage of reports of technology transfer programs that failed miserably due to inadequate assessment of community needs. Instead, tools that were perceived to be most relevant based upon a variety of biases were given and yet when later evaluated where found to be dysfunctional or not in use.\r\n\r\nAgain, that was because they lacked relevance to the lived experiences of the peoples it was intended to help.

So in some cases a rural wireless network may be very relevant and yet in others a underground water collection stations for use during the dry season will be most applicable.', 'Therefore when seeking to promote the livelihoods of peoples through the process of technology transfer it is important to be careful and creative in mapping out projects and types of technologies to be placed in a community to reach maximum use and benefit to those it is intended to support.

Similarly, the assetless peoples often find it impossible to acquire credit for the creation of small businesses becuase they are dependent upon fluctuating levels of income.', 'Development that purses an emphasis towards building the durable assets people have such as land, machinery, or livestock can empower peoples to be self-sufficient even in times of hardship, as they posses the materials necessary for ensuring their livelihood regardless of the larger economic climate.', 'Durable assets in sustainable development can be summarized within four sections: natural capital (natural resource assets), reproducible capital (durable structures or equipment produced by human beings), human capital (the productive potential of human beings), and social capital (norms and institutions that influence the interactions among humans).  The idea of durable assets is that they are capable of generating flows of goods and services (Rust, 1985).\r\n\r\nHere is a simple list of some concrete examples of Durable Assets in which peoples can acquire to support their overall economic security:\r\n     <ul>\r\n     <li>Automobiles</li>\r\n     <li>Land for cultivation</li>\r\n     <li>Computers</li>\r\n     <li>Sewing Machines</li>\r\n     <li>Tools</li>\r\n     <li>Livestock</li>\r\n     </ul>\r\nThis list is by no means meant to be exhaustive but rather meant to illuminate the types of durable assets that can be acquired to provide peoples and families greater means of supporting their livelihoods, both in times of relative prosperity, as well as in those times that prove to be not so prosperous.\r\n\r\nOverall, this pattern emphasizes both a focus (and approach) and concrete goal of engendering livelihood development for peoples left without the means to ensure their own survival. The foundation of a durable assets approach follows from the understandings that fully relying upon one\'s own labor can be problematic in regions in which the economy is vulnerable to dramatic transitions. By giving peoples the power of ownership over their own lives in the good times as well as the bad yet another layer of protection can be added to avoid situations of furthered \"hardcore poverty\".\r\n\r\nFor example, throughout South Asia there is a movement of development driven by the creation of women\'s Self-Help Groups. In these groups people collectively save in order to acquire loans or assets to acquire the tools to initiate income generating activities. Many start-up shops as seamstresses, or begin poultry farming, some go on to open small stores and others as in the case of the Graemeen Bank\'s cell phone program, provide cell service to local people. In each of these examples, a common thread is the tools used. The seamstress must posses a sewing machine to pursue her business, just as the poultry farmer needs the livestock and the land. The cell phone ladies in Bangladesh would not be if it weren\'t for their ownership of the cell phones they use to run their businesses; just as the fisher would go hungry without his tools, so too would farmer without his land, and taxi driver without her taxi.\r\n\r\nThis isn\'t meant to negate the role of creativity of individual or group creativity to generate income, but it the pattern highlights a useful view on how to facilitate the inherent creativity of people for pursuing livelihoods for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nHowever, as long as there exists any durable asset, it is capable of possessing monetary attributes and, therefore, of giving rise to the characteristic problems of a monetary economy (Keynes, 1936). Therefore this pattern could be perceived to reinforce oppressive or unfair economic systems. Yet, despite this issue the reality remains that over a billion people live in extreme poverty without the means to feed or protect their families in times of greater economic hardship; to ignore this fact based upon arguments against the current economic system is perhaps to make a bad situation worse, and only perpetuate socio-economic inequalities.', 'Development practitioners, community members and individuals can participate in ways to consciously pursue the acquisition and sustainability of durable assets to promote income generation activities and support a greater level of economic security to the most vulnerable populations. Such approaches could conceivable be achieved through the linkage of other patterns such as <a href=\"\">self-help groups</a>, <a href=\"\">co-operatives and collectives</a> or a variety of other relevant patterns. Ultimately as a policy, officials in government could, through pressure from social change advocates, develop initiatives to enable individuals and communities to both acquire durable goods, and assist in protecting those assets that they do possess, such as land from external threats.', NULL, 712, 464, '2006-10-23 10:23:53', '2006-10-20 10:20:17', NULL, NULL, 'The Public Sphere Project & St. Mary\'s University', NULL, 284, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Not all people have access to information and ideas from which they might benefit, and the proliferation of ideas does not guarantee that people will encounter them. Information does not always want to be free.', 'Public libraries have a history of successful struggle against the obstacles to the access to information and ideas. Among the findings of a recent research report in the US, they remain trusted and valued by the public, even though funding is becoming increasingly difficult. Public libraries are increasingly becoming a community space; while demand for traditional library services remains strong, public libraries are widely perceived as offering solutions to community problems and they have the potential to do more in future (Public Agenda, 2006).', 'More than 150 years ago, public libraries started to provide people with information and knowledge that would otherwise have been out of reach. Through a publicly-funded lender, ordinary people such as Samuel Johnsons common reader could discover more and better books. At a library open to all, any ambitious working-class youth could seek self-improvement; Andrew Carnegie, future benefactor of public libraries around the world, educated himself as a young immigrant only through the kindness of the owner of a private library. \r\n\r\nBroad public support for the sober and egalitarian institution of the public library allows citizens to encounter difficult, provocative and unpopular ideas. Public libraries embody both the characteristics of their communities and the principles of intellectual freedom. More of one may lead to less of the other. The challenge of liberating libraries is to benefit from the justified pride that communities take in their public libraries while encouraging greater efforts toward intellectual freedom.\r\n\r\nArticle 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares the right of intellectual freedom: to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. This freedom of opinion and expression for all citizens underlies a societys capacity to recognize and realize new possibilities. Civic participation requires access to information and life-long education. Prosperity in a free society depends upon the creativity which comes from diverse and challenging ideas. Democracy\'s survival over time calls for adaptability and critical thought in the face of change.\r\n\r\nThrough professional associations such as the American Libraries Association (ALA) and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA), librarians advocate the principles of intellectual freedom. The pressures that they experience tell us about the obstacles to these principles. Among these obstacles are money, location, coercion, private interests, lack of privacy, and pressure toward conformity.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries provide services regardless of the ability to pay; they serve everyone equally, including those for whom money would otherwise present an obstacle. Though the public library may enjoy broad public approval, funding for this free and open source of information is seldom easily come by. \r\n\r\nPublic libraries provide services regardless of location. Whether in inner cities or remote rural outposts, they reach people who might otherwise not encounter the information and ideas that libraries offer.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries provide services regardless of coercion and censorship. They exist to bring people and ideas together, not to separate them. Public libraries operate at arms length from their sponsors, whether government, taxpayers, volunteer fundraisers (such as Friends groups) or private donors. Despite this, they often struggle with the restriction of information by governments, by self-censorship among librarians, and by those who seek to impose their standards or tastes on others.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries provide services independently of private interests. While respecting intellectual property, public libraries give priority to their patrons over commercial concerns, advocates of particular views, and any other interests which may distort the free flow of information and ideas.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries protect the privacy of their patrons. They encourage people to access information and ideas by maintaining the confidentiality of what they look for, look at, and communicate.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries resist pressures toward conformity which arise even where the diversity of information and ideas is growing.  They take pride in providing ideas and information which are unorthodox, unpopular, or considered dangerous by the majority (American Library Association, 2004).\r\n\r\nAs an information commons (Kranich, 2004, p. 281), the public library provides a forum for information and ideas, it offers new ways to access information, and it recognizes freedom of opinion and expression as the basis of democratic society. Though its strategies and services go beyond the printed word and beyond the walls of the library building, the public library also offers those who love that magical hinged object, the book (Holroyd, 1999, p. 143) a refuge from the possibly less subversive distractions of technology and contemporary media.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries develop access to information in many ways. Individual libraries provide computer access and guidance to patrons, including those who have no other means of using the Internet. Regional aggregation of library catalogs and databases offers patrons a collection much richer than any one library could maintain. Libraries are active in making government information more available, and they work to influence legislation to prevent intellectual property rights from adding new obstacles to access.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries have long worked to develop skills, most often needed by their underserved constituents, in language, literacy, and technology. As more information of increasingly variable quality becomes available, it becomes more and more necessary to evaluate its integrity and independence. With their staff and their patrons, public libraries are beginning to cultivate information literacy: the skills necessary to find, use, and critically evaluate information from many sources.\r\n\r\nSide by side with public libraries\' broad mission for an informed and active citizenry is a focus on the local community and civic dialog. The typical public library offers a public gathering space, available to all regardless of opinion or creed. It may provide a network connection to the local school so that youngsters can use library computers to perform their homework assignments. It may maintain an archive of local history and records, and care for cultural artifacts (such as paintings, for example) of local significance. This local focus can lead to collaborations with other local stakeholders; for example, in the case of a major local environmental issue such as industrial river pollution, the library may work with a government agency to host community meetings and include copies of the agencys reports in a collection of documents related to the issue.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries have a special mission to serve their underserved or information poor (Kranich, 2004, p. 287) constituents. Groups such as urban minorities and rural communities have special difficulty in surmounting the obstacles to accessing and using information and ideas. In some parts of the world, such as the rural north of Peru served by the Rural Library Network (Medcalf, 1999), library services develop literacy through books and storytelling. In situations such as this, public libraries transport books on foot or by pack animalcamels in Kenya, donkeys in Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\nThe public library is an established institution which offers a model for building new institutions and services. It enjoys broad public respect and support, and promotes principles central to democracy and development: (a) intellectual freedom, (b) access to information and to ideas both fashionable and unfashionable, and (c) serving the needs of the underrepresented. If the Navajo call the library a house of papers, it can be much more; through new technologies, new partnerships, and new services it offers what Josh Cohen, director of the Mid-Hudson Library System (www.midhudson.org), calls one of the cornerstones of democracy and one of the building blocks of a strong community.', 'To create access to information, civic participation, and life-long education, use what public libraries already offer and work with them to implement new services.

Yet there is a well-known saying concerning universality: describe your backyard and you will reach humanity. So, on the other hand, these same features of our increasingly digital and connected world also support decentralization, telecommuting and the intangible re-valuation of each local space, of actually \"being there\" or at least making a connection to a specific spot (a \"hot spot\") for the sake of material and immaterial interaction. Thus a new space-time dimension, on a \"glocal\" level (global in reach but ultimately local in its value-producing competencies), creates new human development challenges. This new space-time requires new skills and generates its own styles of employment and ownership, control and freedom.', 'According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glocal: Glocalisation (or glocalization), a portmanteau of globalization and localization, entails one or both of the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The creation or distribution of products or services intended for a global or transregional market, but customized to suit local laws or culture\r\n<li>The use of electronic communications technologies, such as the Internet, to provide local services on a global or transregional basis; Craigslist and Meetup are examples of wW applications that have a glocalized approach.\r\n</ul>\r\nThe global and the local may be regarded as two sides of the same coin. A place may be better understood by recognizing the dual nature of glocalization. Very often localization is neglected in the shadow of the omnipresent veneer presented by globalization. Yet, in many cases, local forces constantly strive to attenuate the impact of global processes. These forces can be seen in efforts to prevent or modify plans for the local construction of buildings for global corporate enterprises, such as for Wal-Mart.\r\n\r\nGlocalisation as a term, though originating in the 1980s from within Japanese business practices, was first popularized in the English-speaking world by the British sociologist Roland Robertson in the 1990s.', 'The \"glocal\" dimension relates to specific areas of economic development models, such as local productive arrangements (LPAs), industrial and sectoral clusters (from the electronics district in Tokyo to software and IT-related hubs in Bangalore).\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the combination of local and global, concrete and universal, remote and present, material and immaterial, tangible and intangible are not clearly demarcated in the glocal development model. Other classic distinctions also become blurred, such as private, public, the \"third sector\" (or philanthropic) and academic or techno-scientific. Telecenters, public spaces in Third World countries that offer free access to the Web as well as other social and educational services are examples of new glocal development tools.\r\n\r\nThese ICT-enabled hubs of social and economic engineering also tend to create and design new social artifacts, thus opening opportunities for self-knowing, lifelong learning and employability.\r\n\r\nMediatic capitalism is a new regime of capital accumulation regulated by the value aggregation of knowledge-creating activities and the development of intangible assets (brands, consumer habits, technological standards and service-based value chains). This new form of capital accumulation has also led, for policy purposes, to the increasingly relevant clustering of creative industries. Telecenters can also play a role in the production of images (and self-representations) in peripheral regions of the world, given appropriate regulatory and techno-economic incentives and subsidies.\r\n\r\nThe term mediatic stresses not only the growing role of media (ICTs or information and communication technologies) but also the key function of intermediaries in the organization of production and distribution networks. \r\n\r\nInfomediaries, regulators and knowledge-based business consortia and local informational clusters are examples of economic agents and institutions defined by their skills in the production and management of information, communication, knowledge and cultural networks in value chains, power dynamics and organizational structures. \r\n\r\nThis perspective requires new approaches to governance in the context of rapid globalization and emerging organizational semiotics and new forms of finance that value social, cultural and intellectual capital.\r\n\r\nFor the peripheral nation-states of the world system, a new threat emerges: there is a growing concern not only with gaps in technology and knowledge, but also with the emergence of a digital divide within developing societies. On the other hand, neo-illuminists preach about the creation of development opportunities led by new technologies (such as the infamous US$100 computer proposed by MIT´s Nicholas Negroponte).\r\n\r\nDigital emancipation was proposed as a conceptual horizon for policy-making related to glocal development in December 2005 at the first international conference on digital emancipation, held in Brazil by the City of Knowledge at the University of São Paulo. Human development as emancipation definitely places the burden of action in the local dimension - stressing traditional and informal knowledge whenever possible, so that human development under mediatic capitalism can lead to sustainability, identity and civic intelligence. These characteristics have often been highlighted by development funding agencies, which are increasingly conscious of the rising importance of glocal economics for the appropriate design and implementation of development policies. Micro and nanoeconomics may in this context be more relevant than classic macro and microeconomics.', 'New forms of exchange, gifts, collaboration and collective action involve not only technical choices but a fundamental consideration for the emancipatory potential of every policy and technological option. Empowerment in the creation of representations may be as important as job creation for youth and actually may be a precondition for jobs to emerge. The critique of local, regional and global as well as other (gender, faith, language) representations of the world in the media becomes as crucial as access to software codes and network engineering.

Building and sustaining community networks requires strategies that facilitate the community appropriation of communication technologies in support of community networking. \r\n\r\nThis pattern is intended as a contribution to, and perhaps even as a catalyst for, a dialogue about community (ICT) networks. Dialogue participants should include: 1) community members; 2) local activists; 3) practitioners (community developers and community technologists); 4) community researchers; 5) policy makers; 6) local businesses and community economic developers. Whilst not exhaustive, the list illustrates the diversity and levels of knowledge and expertise needed to plan and develop community (ICT) networks that empower and strengthen community relationships and processes through democratic communications.', 'It is interesting that community networks are frequently referred to as technological artefacts (Wikipedia, 2006) and appear to be understood in terms of the connectivity they give to ICT rather than the links they facilitate within communities. Yet in his seminal text on the emergence of new, i.e. ICT based, community networks, Schuler explains how the term community networks was a sociological concept  that referred to community communication patterns and relationships (1996)  long before the emergence of the community bulletin boards of the late 1970s (Morino, 1994), i.e. the forerunners for the web-based community networks of the 1990s onwards (Kubicek & Wagner, 1998). \r\n\r\nEstablishing what lies at the heart of community networking, i.e. the purpose and nature of the relationships within communities and the processes of communication, is central to understanding community. Generating knowledge of what shapes and energizes community life by making connections and interacting with people of diverse values and belief systems is pivotal to developing effective community networks. In this respect the effectiveness of community networks is understood in terms of how they support and sustain community communications, relationships and activities. \r\n\r\nAn example of how knowledge of community networking in its broadest sense can be generated and how this knowledge might inform the development of community networks is illustrated by the Community Network Analysis (CNA) project  in the Poets Corner community of Brighton and Hove, UK. Early in the project a community profile (Hawtin, Hughes & Percy-Smith, 1994) was conducted to develop a picture of community assets, community needs and community relationships. Interestingly, the 104 groups, clubs, associations, centres, organisations, etc  often interpret their shared social environment in different ways. Acknowledging the existence of such diversity is a central part of beginning to understand and work with it as a source of community strength rather than community threat. \r\n\r\nAnalysis of the community infrastructure reveals 8 main clusters of groups, clubs, etc and 4 smaller clusters. These clusters, or affiliation networks, are organised by a parent organisation, e.g. community associations and places of worship. Affiliation appears to be based around organisational support mechanisms and the availability of physical space. A number of isolated nodes or didactic networks were also identified, e.g. the two schools are exemplars of a didactic network, although both are keen to develop stronger ties within the community.\r\n \r\n Informal network structures in the community are altogether more open and dynamic than their formal counterparts but are also transient in nature. Familial or friendship ties usually predominate and networking often occurs in public spaces, e.g. Stoneham Park, local pubs and coffee shops, or serendipitous street meetings. This agora effect provides opportunity for knowledge exchange, comfort and mutually supportive transactions. \r\n\r\nInformal social network exchanges tend to be self-organising and mutually reinforcing, falling into one of two categories. 1) Spontaneous, e.g. someones cat has gone missing and the neighbours organise a search of the locality; neighbours leave bags of good quality but unwanted clothes/toys on the door steps of families new to the area as a welcoming gesture; groups of people pop in to each others houses for coffee and a chat  reinforcing and developing social bonds. 2) Organised but with no formal membership, e.g. networks of baby-sitters and parents requiring sitters evolve through the local grapevine; a curry club  where participants try new curry recipes is organised at irregular intervals by email; a book club  run along much the same lines as the curry club is organised by mobile phone; or key holder networks among neighbours in the same street  in which spare keys are cut and distributed among trusted neighbours. \r\n\r\nOur study reveals that both network types play a significant role in developing relationships of trust and social cohesion in the community. The communication technologies that people feel comfortable with are increasingly being used to support both network links and exchanges. If community networks are to support the diversity of social realities in community then they must provide safe and welcoming spaces that encourage and facilitate participation and engagement. Enabling people to tell their stories and interact with one another in ways meaningful to them and in comfortable environments is central to effective community networking. \r\n\r\nA prototype community communication space (CCS) being developed as part of the CNA project attempts to create such spaces. By working with the community to build both the context and the content for the CCS we have been asked to support video and audio podcasting, digital story-telling, digital art, poetry and music. Local communication forums are being established to support the face-to-face forums of community development/building activities. Blogs, wikis and other social software such as social networking applications are also being explored for potential community benefits.\r\n\r\nThe graphic , draws on Rogers diffusion of innovation theory (1995) to illustrate current stages of the CCS diffusion in Poets Corner. \r\n\r\nWorking from the centre outwards the first ring represents the Poets Corner Residents Societys (PCRS) invitation to CNA, and the subsequent invitation from their executive committee to work in partnership with them to map and improve community communications. Much of this period was spent getting to know people in the community, building trust, raising awareness and supporting the activities of PCRS and other community groups. A group of enthusiastic project advocates emerged as CCS innovators. With their assistance the project became grounded in and supportive of community activities and needs. \r\n\r\nSlowly but surely trust and respect developed between the partners. A number of community groups displayed interest in the project and began collaborating. The second ring shows early adopters within the community infrastructure. By this time, the project was participating in and supporting the planning and organisation of a second summer festival and family fun day. The third ring illustrates the resultant increased involvement from the community infrastructure and the beginning of some involvement from local residents. We describe this as second stage early adoption activity. \r\n\r\nDuring the project the CNA partnership has been raising awareness of the potential of the CCS and interest within the community is on the increase. We are now in what Rogers would describe as the trial and evaluation phases of community assessment. Whether or not the CCS will be adopted, and can be sustained beyond the funding of the project will depend largely on the community themselves. The CNA team will continue to collaborate with the community, but our long term objective has always been to design and build a prototype CCS in participation with the community and to explore how the community will take ownership of and sustain that space.', 'The potential scope for ICT to support, enhance and sustain community communications is immense but effective community networks can only be built through meaningful and mutual partnerships of knowledge exchange. Communities are contested spaces rich in diversity. They embrace or reject technologies at their own pace and in their own way. These processes cannot be rushed and must be respected. Accepting that they might have to step out of their community comfort zone\' in order to embrace \'new\' technologies can be threatening . Achieving willingness to participate requires patience and dialogue. Community engagement will only be sustained if the community understands the benefits to community life. If community networks are to emerge as significant components of modern community life, external partners must understand this in context and content. Only then can they contribute in a meaningful way.', NULL, 854, 498, '2006-11-20 14:51:40', '2006-11-14 08:21:52', NULL, NULL, 'CNA Project', NULL, 348, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(271, 261, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Researchers and practitioners often trivialize the relevance of the software in determining the sustainability and success of online communities. Opinions differ widely between two extremes: some implicitly assumes that any software for managing online forums is sufficient (cf. Kim A. J., \"Community Building on the Web\", Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., 2000); others, including E. Wenger (Wenger, 2001), suggest a large set of features (up to 73) must be included in software for managing online communitiesencompassing several different applications, from access to expertise and synchronous interactions, from e-learning spaces to project spacesresulting in complex and expensive proprietary solutions. Between these two extremes, we believe it is necessary to identify a set of basic macro-functionalities that an Online Community Service Engine should provide as well as a framework for extending these functionalities as required. In the course of this effort, support for communicating across community boundaries is as vital as focusing on individual communities.', 'Communities are more and more seen as powerful means for addressing significant problems in many fields of human activities. Virtual and/or online communities extend these possibilities as they remove the time and space constraints of physical communities while preserving the advantages of sharing knowledge and experience, developing mutual trust, and ultimately cooperation.\r\n\r\nLocal communities in developed as well as developing countries, communities of practice within and across enterprises, and learning communities each represent very different situations that can be extended and enriched by an online counterpart. More recently, communities arose directly online, as in the case of  blogs and blogger communities.\r\n\r\nRegardless of these different contexts, online communities are complex socio-technical systems. However, while significant efforts have been made ', 'While the socio-technical nature of online communities is manifest and a massive volume of  literature on online communities now deals with topics such as their sociological aspects and organizational impacts as well as the role they can play is a variety of contexts (within organizations as well as in the society), much less attention has been paid to technological  issues. Actually, otherwise satisfactory sociological analysis and identification of general requirements technologies already available - for instance, usability studies (cf. Preece, 2000) -- do not provide clear hints for software developers.\r\n\r\nEtienne Wenger has probably advanced the most relevant attempt to identify an appropriate technological platform for the features online communities should provide. In his extensive survey (Wenger, 2001), now revised and updated (http://www.technologyforcommunities.com), Wenger identifies a set of critical factors for the success of a community of practice (CoP) and the technological implications for supportive tools in terms of a list of features (73 items) that an online community environment should have if it wants to satisfy its members needs. \r\n\r\nInspired by Wengers work, and through an analysis of software used for managing virtual community (PhpBB, PhpNuke) and community networks (such as FreePort and CSuite) as well as our direct experience of managing several online communities (first of all community networks which constitute our basic competence, De Cindio et al, 2004) with different software, we have worked out a higher-level classification of the macro-functionalities a Online Community Services Engine should provide, which is:<ul><li> homogeneous, since each macro-functionality is at the same level of abstraction as the others;</li><li>complete, since the seven macro-functionalities capture the essentials elements of a fully featured online community service engine; </li><li> general enough to be applied to any kind of online community, that is, communities of practice, community networks, communities of interests, learning communities, etc. </li></ul>The result is the following list of macro-functionalities an online community service engine should provide: <ol><li>Users Management characterizes community members and provides differing and personalized views. Allows discriminating levels of access to community resources. This group of functions includes member directories, access rights, profiles, etc.</li><li>Communication and dialog include all the typical synchronous and asynchronous communication tools such as email, discussion boards, blogs, private messages, chats, etc.</li><li> Information and publishing allow community members to manage content for publishing as with a standard content management system (CMS), but - which we believe essential in an Online Community Services Engine - an effective integration with the communication and dialog dimension (Benini et al, 2005).</li><li>Community awareness gives members the sense of belonging to a community that is characterized by rules, roles, history, customs, etc. Examples of these features are: presence awareness (knowing who is online), reputation and ranking, personal history, subscriptions, distinctive look and feel.</li><li>Calendaring includes features for storing personal or community events or appointments by date, together with reminders features and the possibility of sharing calendars among members based on access rights.</li><li>Workgroup support features. These features are based on the ability to restrict member access to community resources like forums, upload file areas, calendars, etc. </li><li>Monitoring and statistics, i.e., features for keeping track of access, the number of posts, liveliness of forums, moderators reliability, etc.; to trace the health indicators of the community.</li></ol>Beside these general-purpose macro-functionalities, an Online Community Services Engine should be able to be integrated with modules that offer features relevant for any specific type of community. For example teaching modules for learning communities, or deliberation facilities for civic and community networks.\r\n \r\nTo facilitate the integration of basic functionalities with dedicated features necessary to support specific types of communities, the Online Community Services Engine:<ul><li>must have an overall modular architecture for integrating functionalities that were not built-in;</li><li>must include a User Management component capable of supplying authentication and authorization services to external add-on components or tools (while most of the user management components of the software used to implement online communities - e.g. PHPNuke - do not accept authentication requests from external modules); </li></ul>Both these requirements have the effect of opening the Online Community Services Engine through standard protocols, thereby facilitating cross-community communication. For the same reason, the Online Community Services Engine should include features such as RSS feeds which enhance information exchange.\r\n\r\nAll these functionalities are possible if the Online Community Services Engine is implemented on standard base-technologies, such as the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to handle authentication and authorization and Web services for providing standard interoperability among modules.', 'This classification of the macro-functionalities an Online Community Services Engine should provide, together with the associated architectural requirements, challenge researchers and practitioners to implement and deploy an Online Community Services Engine that can be tailored by the community that uses it; i.e., each deployment of the engine should be created as an instance of the engine, including the set of functionalities necessary for each specific online community. The opening requirement naturally calls for developing software using open-source tools.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the resulting classification can also be viewed as a check list for selecting from available software (proprietary or not), rather than for development purposes.', NULL, 492, 789, '2006-04-17 18:30:27', '2006-10-30 13:23:58', 'RCM - Milan Community Network - Italy', NULL, 'University of Milano', NULL, 160, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(272, 262, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'People have always traded or bartered with each other, using different tools and materials to represent and store value in various kinds of transactions; trade, investment, consumption, production, marriage, kinship, sacrifice. In complex, urban and global capitalist societies, money expands the potential for growth and accumulation, while also creating new forms of wealth and power concentration, regulated by central banks and other supervisory authorities at national and international levels. Community Currencies or  complementary currencies offer a solution for local markets deprived or unserved by global or national currencies.', 'Thomas Greco states three basic ways in which conventional money malfunctions: there is never enough of it, it is misallocated at its source so that it goes to those who already have lots of it, and it systematically pumps wealth from the poor to the rich. The symptoms of a \"polluted\" money supply are too familiar: inflation, unemployment, bankruptcies, foreclosures, increasing indebtedness, homelessness, and a widening gap between the rich and the poor.  However, the ultimate resource of the community, the productivity, skills, and creativity of its members, is not limited by lack of money. (Meeker-Lowry, 1995)', 'According to Michael Linton, \"Money is really just an immaterial measure, like an inch, or a gallon, a pound, or degree. While there is certainly a limit on real resources -- only so many tons of wheat, only so many feet of material, only so many hours in the day -- there need never be a shortage of measure. (No, you cant use any inches today, there arent any around, they are all being used somewhere else.) Yet this is precisely the situation in which we persist regarding money. Money is, for the most part, merely a symbol, accepted to be valuable generally throughout the society that uses it. Why should we ever be short of symbols to keep account of how we serve one another?\" (Meeker-Lowry, 1995)\r\n\r\n\"The proper kind of money used in the right circumstances is a liberating tool that can allow the fuller expression of human creativity. Money has not lived up to its potential as a liberator because it has been perverted by the monopolization of its creation and by politically manipulating its distribution -- available to the favored few and scarce for everyone else.\"2  Creating community currencies may foster exchanges among people that need it most.\r\n\r\nConventional money is strictly regulated by central authorities at a federal level.  Its regulated scarcity is a major source of powerful economic policy (i.e..raising interest rates to curb inflation) that plays on the rules of capitalist competition.  Community currencies, on the other hand, are designed to counterweight scarcity by promoting exchanges founded on cooperation or collaboration. The emergence of new information and communication technologies has promoted numerous local projects that use open source money or collaborative money.  Both  conventional money and community currencies, however, rest on the same foundation, that is, confidence in the agreed on rules of production and supply of monetary and financial instruments (credits, loans, time sharing, etc.). Both are conventions designed and operated by living human communities.\r\n\r\nCommunity currencies may also be qualitative rather than quantitative, so that the purchasing power of the currency takes advantage of specific ranges of skills and resources (child and social health care, environmental campaigns or edutainment projects), unlike the conventional economy which values certain skills and devalues or ignores others as effects of blind market forces.  The move toward community currency is motivated by the desire to bridge the gap between what we earn and what we need to survive financially. \r\n\r\nLocal currencies are seen as a community-building tool.  Communities may range from solidarity economies in slums and vulnerable social areas, to game players, to collectors or charity donors; spread throughout the entire world as digital networks promote new forms of community life.  Community currencies not only prove a commitment to community building and to supporting whats local but also may function as a path towards a greater experiential understanding of the role of economics and money in our daily lives. Any community can, in principle, design currencies backed by something, tangible or intangible, that the community agrees has collective value. \r\n\r\nHundreds of community currency models are at work these days. These are a few of the community currency reference sites - Bernard Lietaer,\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Lietaer; Resources for Community Currency Activists, http://www.communitycurrency.org/resources.html; Luca Fantacci, \"Complementary Currencies: a Prospect on Money from a Retrospect on Premodern Practices\", http://akira.arts.kuleuven.be/meijifin/node/52; Social Trade Organisation, http://www.strohalm.net/en/site.php; Open Money, http://www.thetransitioner.org/wiki/tiki-index.phppage=Open+Money+home+page.  \r\n\r\nITHACA HOURS, where everyones honest hour of labor has the same dignity and LETS, Local Exchange Trading Systems are examples of such models.  These two community currency models illustrate new forms of social and communicative practices that have a real impact on living structures at a local level.\r\n\r\nThe ITHACA HOURS system was created in 1991 by Paul Glover, a community economist and ecological designer. With ITHACA HOURS, each HOUR is equivalent to $10.00 because thats the approximate average hourly wage in Tompkins County, Ithaca, New York. Participants are able to use HOURS for rent, plumbing, carpentry, car repair, chiropractic, food (two large locally-owned grocery stores as well as farmers market vendors accept them), firewood, childcare, and numerous other goods and services. Some movie theaters accept HOURS as well as bowling alleys and the local Ben & Jerrys. (Meeker-Lowry, 1995)\r\n\r\nThe LETS model was created on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, as a self contained network in which members buy and sell services to other members and are paid in the LETS currency. Every member has an individual account which records their debit or credit. Members do not \"owe\" the person or business providing the service, instead their debt is to the LETS system, and their debt is thus socialized.( James DeFilippus, 2004)\r\n\r\n\"Currencies are powerful carriers of feedback information, and potent triggers of adjustments, but on their own terms. (Jacobs, 1984)  A national currency registers, above all, consolidated information on a nations international trade.\" (Jacobs, 1984)  National dollars tend to flow out of local communities where they are needed the most to those who already control large pools of wealth like banks and corporations. Community currency is also a tool that can help revitalize local economies by encouraging wealth to stay within a community rather than flowing out. It provides valuable information about the communitys balance of trade and collective values. (Meeker-Lowry, 1995)\r\n\r\nPeople who are time-rich and cash poor can be socially and economically productive without necessarily using only national or international, centrally regulated money. If community currencies can also be used in conjunctions with national currency their use does not have to become an all or nothing proposition, thus leading to the notion of complementary currencies. \r\n\r\nLocal currencies empower their members to improve their circumstances and environment while protecting the general community from the negative influences of other capital flows. This gives the community more control over investments and allows the poor to become emancipated beings in the economic choices and conditions that affect their daily lives. Local currency systems offer the opportunity of transforming labor power or working time into local purchasing power. (Meeker-Lowry, 1995)', 'There are unique challenges in implementing a community currency system, both technical and political. Shared values and multiplayer commitment by community members are needed to build a sustainable currency. Adequate management at the local level may involve monetary policy issues similar to those experienced at national or international spheres. The community may be local, but also involve participants from distant places acting towards a common goal that can be social, educational and cultural. If successful, a community currency system can leverage local projects in economically depressed areas of the map and put them on the road to a hopeful and fruitful future.', NULL, 772, 403, '2006-10-23 10:22:59', '2006-10-22 14:46:02', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 351, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Unfortunately this most often deprives whole societies and the world\'s poorest people of their right to an equitable sense of well-being and opportunity.', 'Corruption, although illegitimate, is a common mechanism of social domination. In one basic form it exacts a price from people with little power in exchange for a \"favor\" from someone with more power. In another form, two or more people or organizations with power swap \"favors\" for mutual advantage. The \"favor\" can be large or small and it can be granted or denied at the pleasure of the power-holder, whose criteria, rationale, and legitimacy for the decision is hidden and, therefore, unavailable for  review or criticism. Although the degree of corruption varies from place to place, everybody at one time or another can be a victim, however indirectly. Journalists, business people, government officials, activists, educators as well as \"ordinary\" people - citizens - are affected by corruption and can play a role in its prevention.', 'At its most basic level, \"Transparency\" is \"the quality of being able to be seen through.\" When used in a social context it means \"easily detected, understood: obvious, evident.\" To exhibit transparency means that the reality of how things actually work is not occluded by false or misleading layers of artifice. Transparency thus helps shed light on corrupt practices that thrive on secrecy. \r\n\r\nAt a time when concern is mounting over the seemingly overwhelming range of problems facing our world, the principle and initiatives of transparency advocates are gaining momentum and significant interest within a broadening global discourse. While rights to privacy and protection are critical benchmarks in evaluating the relative health of a democracy, deterrents and penalties to corruption are essential if efforts designed to invigorate social justice are to become more successful. \r\n\r\nIt turns out that the relatively simple approach of making transactions &mdash; both monetarily and information-based &mdash; of the powerful <i>visible</i> has the desired effect of discouraging corruption and encouraging good works. Learning about corruption is a first step towards rooting it out &mdash; but it\'s only the initial step. Rooting out corruption is often a long, frustrating, thankless and sometimes dangerous enterprise. A corrupt court system, for example, is likely to free guilty people in certain instances, and non-corrupt judges may pay with their lives when they act to convict guilty people. \r\n\r\nNiccolo Machiavelli introduced the familiar social equation, \"Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely\" that asserts that corruption is an inevitable consequence of power, and that the greater the power - the greater the resultant corruption. Machiavelli\'s perspective reminds us why citizens are naturally suspicious, for example, of secret meetings between government officials and corporate executives. For example, when Bush administration officials met behind closed doors with executives from the world\'s biggest energy corporations to discuss U.S. energy policy. \r\n\r\nIn truth, Machiavelli\'s wisdom provides governments with ample incentive for making such meetings more open or \"transparent.\" Corruption is not intrinsically the province of one political party or another. It does thrive, however, in situations where secrecy and fear are prevalent. The Enron and WorldCom scandals certainly provided lessons that were largely responsible for the whistleblower protection provisions of the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\" in the U.S.\r\n\r\nOn the international front, groups that adopt transparency as a prerequisite to their work while providing expert advice, include IISD (International Institute for Sustainable Development), whose model <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/IISD.pdf\">\"Multilateral Agreement on Investment for Sustainable Development\"</a> brought the convention of sustainability to influence within OECD (Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development) &mdash; by helping design both legal and policy instruments on foreign investment. \r\n\r\nWhile numerous projects and symposia have focused on transparency, two relatively recent events are especially relevant to this pattern\'s \"big picture\" at a most sensitive time in human history. They are the <a href=http://ww1.transparency.org/in_focus_archive/30th_ratification/30th_ratification.html>United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)</a> and the ongoing, <a href=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_security/china/ucs-china-joint-workshops-on-transparency.html>USC (Union of Concerned Scientists) Transparency Project (2000-2001)</a> that has been working for over a decade to foster the \"intellectual and institutional capacity to increase transparency through participation in international arms control negotiations\".  \r\n\r\nThe Transparency pattern is very general and can be applied in various cultures and in various situations that include the following: <ul></li><li> Disaster aid and reconstruction, such as that related to the Southeast Asian tsunami\r\n</li><li> Decisions about what articles to run in newspapers or on television news shows\r\n</li><li> Source of funding for columnists\r\n</li><li> Decisions about corporate executive salaries and severance packages\r\n</li><li> Inspectors of new construction, fish harvests, food quality, tax returns\r\n</li><li> Building permits and other land-use decisions\r\n</li><li> \"Revolving door\" between executives in weapons corporations and government officials who buy from them\r\n</li><li> Lobbying government officials (versus bribes for legislative support)\r\n</li><li> Welfare systems\r\n</li><li> Judicial systems\r\n</li><li> Money laundering, or support or opposition to banking transparency legislation\r\n</li><li> Attendance at government meetings by corporate executives to decide policies where they are the direct beneficiaries</ul>One of the greatest strengths of transparency as a social pattern can be found in its inclusiveness. Highlighting this point are grassroots activists who are elevating public awareness and forming alliances with many types of people and groups. As a result the \'practice of transparency\' is becoming a model of increasingly influence. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 1999 the Poder Ciudadano (Citizen Power) an NGO group based in Argentina \"negotiated an integrity pact with the city government of Buenos Aires\", to monitor a 1.2 billion dollar subway construction project to \"root out corruption\". Across political, economic, industrial, scientific, legal, and civic sectors numerous reform initiatives are being coordinated providing benchmarks for accountability and success that are being applauded. These evolving strategies have resulted in a holistic \"integrity approach\" towards waging a unified struggle against corruption. The resulting \'victories\' provide a great ray of hope for countries and peoples ravaged by decades &mdash; or centuries &mdash; of tyranny. Hence, \'transparency\' is now poised to have a greater and greater influence on enforcing Civil Society values over time. \r\n\r\nTransparency International was launched by people who shared a \"common experience of having witnessed first hand the devastating effects of cross-border corruption\" and is now providing leadership in the battle against corruption worldwide. Over the years Transparency International has developed a wide range of useful tools and information resources. These include: <ul><li> TI Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), the best known of TI\'s tools. It has been credited with putting the issue of corruption on the international policy agenda. The CPI ranks more than 150 countries in terms of perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys.\r\n</li><li> Global Corruption Barometer: A survey that assesses general public attitudes toward and experience of corruption in dozens of countries around the world.\r\n</li><li> Global Corruption Report: 2006 focuses on the health sector, where lack of integrity can be a matter of life and death.\r\n</li><li> TI Integrity Pact (IP): A tool aimed at preventing corruption in public contracting; consisting of a process that includes an agreement between a government department (at the federal, national or local level) and all bidders for a public contract. The IP also introduces a monitoring system that provides for independent oversight and accountability.\r\n</li><li> TI Bribe Payers Surveys: Annual tool that evaluates the supply side of corruption - the propensity of firms from industrialized countries to bribe abroad.\r\n</li><li> Business Principles: This comprehensive reference aims to provide a practical tool to which companies can look for a comprehensive reference to good practice to counter bribery. Designed as a starting point for businesses to develop their own anti-bribery systems or as a benchmark.\r\n</li><li> TI Integrity Pact (IP) is a tool aimed at preventing corruption in public contracting.</li></ul>Transparency is fundamental to the evolution of a just and humane civil society. Focusing on transparency should help thwart corruption at the root(s) and help create new solutions to age-old problems stemming from greed, fear, anger and stupidity.\r\n\r\nA concentrated effort to foster visibility is fundamental for the success of this project. Humanity has much to learn from the many tangible gains and policy shifts that are taking effect. As stated at the beginning of this pattern, corruption in its various guises can deprive whole societies of opportunity and a sense of well-being. This reality beckons us to develop constructive innovations that stand at the vortex of change. If we are successful, this work holds the promise of giving new life to the testimony and values of peace, justice and solidarity for generations to come.', 'Using traditional, as well as new forms of on-line media and ICT, we can continue to raise public awareness about specific struggles over transparency while exposing, protesting and defying corruption at all levels. It is important at the same time to continue to broaden the support for  transparency initiatives and enforcement. In this way, more accountability can be demanded which can be translated into the development of equitable practices and policies.', NULL, 523, 589, '2006-08-14 15:01:58', '2006-09-29 09:09:42', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project', NULL, 335, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Unfortunately for them, corporate marketeers, government security forces and criminals, both amateur and professional, are working hard to uncover and exploit these secrets. While it\'s clear that some information of this sort needs to be uncovered for the common good (news of an impending terrorist attack, for example), this need is sometimes invoked as a pretext for trampling on privacy protections. Without adequate safeguards, dictators and other authoritarians (including many in putatively democratic societies) spy on critics of their regimes, an activity that can result in harassment or even torture or death of the critics in many places around the world.', 'Legitimate governments, civil society, and concerned individuals must work together to prevent the all-too-common privacy abuses where the powerful prey upon the less powerful. In what the Kinks call \"the wonderful world of technology\" the basic ingredients including massive amounts of personal information in digital form, ubiquitous communication networks and inexpensive and miniscule surveillance devices, coupled with the social equation of eager snoops and unsuspecting dupes, has helped create an explosion of privacy abuses and the potential for untold others. The fact that human <i>identities</i> themselves are now routinely \"stolen\" reveals the severity of the threat and how much \"progress\" is being made in the advancement of privacy abuse.', 'In 1763, the noted English Parliamentarian William Pitt in his \"Speech on the Excise Tax\" declared that \"The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the force of the Crown. It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storms may enter; the rain may enter  but the King of England cannot enter; all his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.\"\r\n\r\nNow nearly 250 years after Pitt\'s speech modern day rulers use technology to easily enter the tenements, both ruined and intact, of millions of people without a warrant or the problems associated with actual physical entrance. In the campaign to re-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger to the governor\'s office in California, according to Michael Blood (2006), \"The Schwarzenegger campaign has stockpiled millions of names, phone numbers and addresses with consumer preferences, voting histories and other demographic information.\" Then, based on assumptions about consumer preferences (a Democrat, for example, is more likely to drive a hybrid vehicle, while a Republican is more likely to drive a pickup truck or Cadillac), they employed \"microtargeting\" to carefully craft messages to appeal to the people they believe they now understand based on their interpretation of the data. According to Blood, \"The idea is an outgrowth of techniques that businesses have long used to find new customers. ... Few people might realize how much information is publicly available, for a price, about their lifestyles. Companies collect and sell consumer information they buy from credit card companies, airlines and retailers of every stripe.\" \r\n\r\nWhy is technology so crucial &mdash; and so threatening right now?  The quick answer is plenty of product and buyers. The laundry list of new technology is growing daily and institutions are not afraid to (ab)use it. Some, if not most, of the technology is plagued by problems that are either \"built-in\" (or otherwise inherent or inevitable) to the technology and/or subject to misuse. \"Face recognition\" software, at least currently, falls into the first category. John Graham, for example, of the Giraffe Project, faced a problem in the second category when his name showed up on the U.S. \"No fly list\" for no discernible reason. After several letters to the government he finally received word that his \"identity has been verified,\" meaning, presumably that yes <i>he</i> is the \"John Graham\" in question. Currently his name has not been removed from the list, whether this is attributable to incompetence, work overload, or basic mean-spiritedness is not easily determined. \r\n\r\nAccording to Privacy International, <blockquote>\"Privacy is a fundamental human right. It underpins human dignity and other values such as freedom of association and freedom of speech. It has become one of the most important human rights of the modern age.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is recognized around the world in diverse regions and cultures. It is protected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and in many other international and regional human rights treaties. Nearly every country in the world includes a right of privacy in its constitution. At a minimum, these provisions include rights of inviolability of the home and secrecy of communications. Most recently written constitutions include specific rights to access and control one\'s personal information. In many of the countries where privacy is not explicitly recognized in the constitution, the courts have found that right in other provisions. In many countries, international agreements that recognize privacy rights such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights have been adopted into law.\" </blockquote>The organization also points out that \"The recognition of privacy is deeply rooted in history. There is recognition of privacy in the Qur\'an and in the sayings of Mohammed. The Bible has numerous references to privacy. Jewish law has long recognized the concept of being free from being watched. There were also protections in classical Greece and ancient China.\r\n\r\nAlthough privacy is seen as a fundamental and universal right, it\'s not easily to define. For one thing, it does depend to some degree on culture and context. New communication technology as well as new surveillance technology has shown also that privacy &mdash; and the threats to it &mdash; also change over time. Generally speaking, \"privacy protection is frequently seen as a way of drawing the line at how far society can intrude into a person\'s affairs\" (Privacy International, ____). United States Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis explained privacy simply as the individual\'s \"right to be left alone.\" \r\n\r\nPrivacy can be divided into the following separate but related concepts (Privacy International, 2006): <blockquote><b>Information privacy,</b> which involves the establishment of rules governing the collection and handling of personal data such as credit information, and medical and government records. It is also known as \"data protection\";\r\n<b>Bodily privacy,</b> which concerns the protection of people\'s physical selves against invasive procedures such as genetic tests, drug testing and cavity searches;\r\n<b>Privacy of communications,</b> which covers the security and privacy of mail, telephones, e-mail and other forms of communication; and\r\n<b>Territorial privacy,</b> which concerns the setting of limits on intrusion into the domestic and other environments such as the workplace or public space. This includes searches, video surveillance and ID checks. </blockquote> Each of the types of privacy concept mentioned above has a variety of ways in which the privacy can be abused or invaded. What can be done to stop or slow down these abuses? <i>You can spy on some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time.  You can\'t spy on all of the people all of the time   yet.</i>\r\n\r\nThe ultimate aim is self-restraint where government and other groups and institutions that have a propensity o invade privacy stop doing it.  Whether apocryphal or not, there was a feeling that \"Gentlemen don\'t read other people\'s mail.\" Although it\'s not always obvious, there are always (presumably) limits to what people or institutions do that are either self-imposed by habit or by fear of retribution or other penalties. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it\'s not the case that people should just trust governments or businesses or other people or institutions who might feel obliged to invade your privacy. What can individuals do to protect their rights?  And what can individuals do to get out from problems where privacy has already been <i>invaded?</i> As individuals and as members of organizations (like the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Privacy Information Center, and Privacy Rights International) who stand up for privacy rights we must  anticipate abuses, monitor powerful (and otherwise snoopy), develop policy, negotiate and engage with authorities (law enforcement, legislators), redress abuses. There are many ways in which people can &mdash; and should &mdash; take personal initiative. These include encrypting e-mail, shredding, protecting yourself from identity theft; and, generally, falling for scams. Initiating lawsuits against the government and corporations for breaches in privacy can be an effective tool of the citizenry in behalf of privacy although ideally it would be much preferred if these institutions could be counted on to police themselves adequately.\r\n\r\nThe idea that \"an innocent person has nothing to fear\" is an illusion. Worse, it shows a lack of knowledge that is almost breathtaking. If privacy is the \"right to be left alone\" then different people will have draw different boundary lines &mdash; but everybody will draw one. On the other side of that boundary are institutions and people who will <i>cross that line</i> if they are emboldened to do so. There are also of course times when government or police are legitimately obligated to cross that line, but they will need to do so in a manner that is legitimate for the times. <i>There is never a time when there is no line.</i>  Thus privacy is important to everybody in the world.  It is also an important policy to consider for groups of people as well.  When, for example, would it be necessary to forcefully bring a small group that existed communally for centuries into a cash economy. When is it ethically acceptable to bring the \"word of god\" (one of them at least) to people of another religion?  When does one bomb a country to bring the benefits of democracy to it? \r\n\r\nWe\'d like to think that people would not have to resort to extraordinary measures to protect themselves from privacy intrusion and invasion After all, in the \"best of all possible worlds\" people wouldn\'t bother about privacy. Fortunately we don\'t live in the best of all possible worlds. There is ample evidence  in fact that the assault on privacy has only just begun. There are a number of  problems that are simply \"waiting to happen\" Google, for example, owns an immense amount of information about virtually everybody who has ever searched for anything online. While it may be true that, as their mission statement states, they\'ll \"do no evil,\" how can we be sure about the company in five or ten years time. And just as spammers keep finding way to send electronic dreck, the unethical collection of personal information may be done by new types of spybots, which could be part of e-blackmail rackets, possibly in conjunction with faked digital evidence. Although some people have less reason to fear government, business or criminal impinging on their privacy we all face problems, real and potential of abuse. For that reason privacy rights are often strongly associated with human rights, for example. Privacy is not just an issue for dissidents or political activists.', 'We are all living in an era when new technology and security concerns &mdash; both genuine and feigned &mdash; raise tremendous threats to privacy. The threat is real and the struggle against it must be equally as strong. Be cognizant of the critical importance of privacy and work conscientiously on all fronts to protect privacy rights. Public education is important in this area as are public campaigns against privacy invaders.', NULL, 570, 593, '2006-12-11 10:30:28', '2006-12-11 10:25:36', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(275, 265, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Democratic societies rely on diversity of viewpoints and ideas for the intelligence, engagement, enthusiasm and wisdom that they need to stay alive. This is particularly important during this current era of globalization and critical public issues that require public engagement. At the same time people all over the world are receiving more and more of their information from the mass media which is becoming precipitously less diverse. The control of much of the world\'s media is becomingly increasingly concentrated in a handful of giant corporations.', 'Although the exact situation will vary from place to place, virtually all communities are affected by the lack of media diversity and all communities have opportunities to help promote media diversity. In the consolidating world of corporate mass media, large companies are touting mergers and monopolistic ownership practices as being conducive to diversity of programming and community representation in broadcasting. This claim of diversity is a facade that circumvents and ignores the idea of true community access.', 'A rich, dynamic universe of public thinking helps to ensure that all sides in public matters will be taken into consideration thus promoting social &mdash; as well as economic &mdash; innovation. A paucity of diversity doesn\'t just jeopardize societal innovation however. It becomes a threat to democracy itself. When media diversity is too low, public opinion is less likely to provide the oversight that democratic societies require and is more likely to be engaged in public affairs and less willing to entertain new ideas. \r\n\r\nBen Bagdikian is generally credited with the sounding of the alarm on media concentration in the U.S. His book, The Media Monopoly (1983) revealed the disturbing fact that 50 corporations owned the majority of US media companies and this trend towards concentration was continuing. That trend has continued unabated for the 20 or so years since the original publication and now five corporations own approximately the same percentage of media output in the U.S as the 50 did in 1983. Today media corporations argue that when a company is able to monopolize a market, they can provide a more diverse array of cultures and voices than if that media landscape was broken into independently owned outlets. To use radio as a simple example, executives claim that when a corporation owns the majority of a market, the number of different formats increases dramatically. While it may be true that different formats increase, it\'s doubtfuil that this reflects an increased diversity of opinion. Many media corporations use the opportunity to record one radio show which they then rebroadcast from all of their other stations with similar formats, sometimes \"localizing\" the show with a few references (pronounced correctly hopefully). \r\n\r\nA lack of media diversity invariably means media concentration and media concentration exacerbates problems of media homogeneity. The problem of media concentration extends beyond mere banality; it represents a major threat to the ability of citizens to act conscientiously and to govern themselves as democracy requires. Media concentration brings power above and beyond what mere information provision would demand; illegitimate political and economic power invariably comes with the territory and the nearly inevitable cozy connection with political elites leads to a self-perpetuating cycle that is extremely difficult to break. When media concentration reaches certain levels, it then can keep an issue out of the public eye and, hence, off the public agenda. An important and relevant point of fact is the virtual blackout on stories involving media consolidation over the past two decades. Intense media concentration also allows companies to more easily work with government to pass legislation in its favor, notably overturning laws that combat media concentration; and not stepping on government toes because of possible retribution. It may already be too late. As Bagdikian notes, \"Corporate news media and business-oriented governments have made common cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe U.S. is not the only victim of media monopolization: Conrad Black in the U.K. and Canada, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and Rupert Murdoch in Australia (and, now, after a special act of congress, in the U.S. as well) [more?] and many others are huge players in national markets while global media consolidation is now proceeding ahead in increasingly troubling ways. \r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, when use of the Internet was beginning to explode into the among the general population &mdash; or, more accurately, of people who are relatively well-off economically, especially those who live in countries that are relatively well-off economically &mdash; some of the digerati were quite eager to dismiss any protestations over media monopolization in the \"smokestack\" (i.e. non-Internet-based) media industries that included broadcast, print and others. They reasoned that the <i>inherent</i> nature of the Internet made it more-or-less immune to human tinkering, in contrast to humankind\'s inventions. Not only was it <i>inalterable</i> but it would soon prove the obsolescence of the old-fashioned media and, at the same time, provide diversity of viewpoint despite corporate or government efforts. Within several years of the Internet\'s inception it has become incredibly commercial and now, 10 or 15 years later, a mere handful of sites accounts for half the number of sites first seen as their web browser is invoked. This is not to say that the Internet is not important. It\'s absolutely critical as millions upon millions of political actions initiated by civil society has demonstrated. And it\'s absolutely clear that citizen activism will be indispensable to prevent control from being seized gradually or not-so-gradually by corporate and/or government bodies. It\'s also clear that older forms of media should be not abandoned to corporate entities &mdash even if you believe that the Internet will put them all of business anyway! \r\n\r\nOur media and information systems do not exist in a sealed bubble independent of the capitalist structure. Because you must either own or hold stakes in a news or entertainment company to have any semblance of control over its content, the rich control our news and entertainment. While community-operated media does exist in nearly every city, its saturation and distribution into the communities is extremely low because of financial restrictions. The news and entertainment offered by these resources are vastly diverse from the corporate-owned outlets, often representing conflicting accounts and stories. Because the conflicting programming often represents the viewpoints of a different social class than of that which owns the corporations, this programming rarely makes it into the mass media. The corporate owners claim they can provide an adequate diversity of community voice, when in truth the diversity they provide is severely limited by their moneyed interests.\r\n\r\nPeople can get involved in the struggle in many ways. One of the most direct ways is to create and support independent media. This not only means developing videos, comics, zines, blogs, etc. with alterative points-of-view, it means developing funding and distribution approaches, and fighting for representation within the political system. For while it may be true that globalization and new communication technologies change the rules of the game, there are still likely to be <i>rules</i> and for this reason civil society must be vigilant: changes in protocols, domain name registry, domain servers, etc. etc. can have vast repercussions. \r\n\r\nOne of the most effective approaches, however, remains the development of public interest policy that promotes media diversity. Although critics of this approach are likely to scoff at its quaint, \"smokestack\" <i>modus operandi,</i> governments in democratic societies have an obligation to support democratic systems and the democratic experiment may be terminated earlier than anticipated by its original proponents if they fail in this duty. \r\n\r\nThe policies that governments can enact fall into two broad categories: those that limit the enclosure by the big corporations into various regions or \"markets\" and those that promote media diversity by promoting alternatives to corporate mono-cultures such as government subsidies or tax breaks to independent media or specific set-asides for radio or television spectra, etc. Media diversity represents both a desired state for the media environment and an absence of concentrated ownership of media. For that reason people need to fight for both: media diversity and diversity of media ownership.', 'Democratic societies require diversity of opinions. Although government is often negligent in this area, media corporations cannot be allowed to assume too much concentration. As in other realms, power corrupts, and media corporations are of course not exceptionss to this rule. Citizens must vigilant to ensure that a diversity of opinions is availale and that citizens have access to the media. Diversity of <i>ownership</i> of media is one approach that is likely to promote diversity of opinion in the media.', NULL, 537, 865, '2006-11-20 13:28:20', '2006-11-20 10:36:27', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Whether researchers or practitioners, community informaticians too often enter communities having already decided what the issues and solutions should be, reducing rather than enhancing community empowerment.', 'Any time that a professional is working with place-based, virtual or identity community attempting to improve its ability to gather, use, and communicate information, there is a risk that the professional', 'The developing field of community informatics occupies an intersection between information and communication technologies, community development, and community-based research.  All three fields are attempting to improve community life, especially in communities excluded from normal access to power and wealth, and can inform a code of ethics for community informatics.\r\n\r\nIn the information and communication technology field corporate-driven design has been ethically bankrupt, but participants in the open-source software movement and related organizations such as Computer Professionals for social Responsibility and the Free Software Foundation have highly developed ethical principles. The focus of those ethics is that people have the right to not just information itself, but also to the means of producing information.  Thus, people have the right to use software and to access the software source code to understand how the software works with information:  This right carries the obligation to improve the software and to make your improvements public (Free Software Foundation, 2006).\r\n\r\nCommunity development focuses more on the relationship between the practitioner and the community.  The Community Development Society (2006) emphasizes that the practitioner should promote participation of all community members, work to enhance their understanding of the complex dynamics affecting their community and how those factors may impact options for community development, and build their leadership capacity to take charge of its own community development process.\r\n\r\nThe field of community-based research lacks a singular code of ethics, but past problems with the practice, particularly in First Nations contexts, have led the Canadian government (2006) to develop an ethical code that can apply to all research with communities. This code emphasizes that any research should be a partnership between the community and the researcher, with a research design that fits the community culture, where control over the research is shared by the community, and benefits from the research flow to the community.\r\n\r\nThe following principles for community informaticians flow from these sources:\r\n\r\n	Build the communitys information powerthis requires that the researcher/practitioner assists the community in knowing how to decide what information they need, how to make informed choices about how to get that information, and how to access and adapt the tools they need to achieve their information objectives.\r\n	Build the communitys relational powerthis requires that the researcher/practitioner assists the community in building its own democratic practices and develops leaders who can shepherd those practices, and in organizing interventions in ways that build relationships among community members.\r\n	Build the communitys public powerthis requires that the researcher/practitioner assists the community in knowing how to focus their information power and their relational power on impacting the broader external conditions imposed by corporations and governments that oppress and exploit communities, thus democratizing the broader society.\r\n\r\nUnder these principles, traditional research that extracts information from communities, processes it elsewhere, and only builds the careers of academics, or traditional practice that practices the same information extraction and then returns to sell the community on an externally-designed intervention, are no more acceptable than the multinational corporation that extracts raw materials and then tries to sell back finished products.  Such purposeful underdevelopment is the antithesis of these ethical principles.\r\n\r\nThese principles can have uncomfortable implications particularly for researchers.  Building a communitys information power and relational power means, minimally, that at the end of the project the community knows enough that it can do the next project on its own if it wishes.  That requires a researcher who can help community members develop their research and program design skills.  Researchers must also give up culturally rigid standards of what constitutes good research, and understand that the community may have its own research processes and its own standards of what constitutes good information, such as oral traditions and folk art, that require the same status as positivist science.  Researchers or community members, then, must have special skills in community organizing that can direct the research process (Stoecker, 1999).\r\n\r\nFor practitioners, who may be used to applying a common toolkit to problems in communities flung far and wide, these principles can also require important changes.  Following these ethics require that the practitioner work with community members to not just apply a tool, but to understand it, how it is created, and how it can be adapted to their unique circumstances.\r\n\r\nAs an example of these ethics, consider a project to help a group of nongovernmental organizations, where one organization has incompatible databases, and another wants to communicate more efficiently with its membership.  You convert the first organizations data to a common format, and set up an e-mail list for the second.  But these interventions would violate the principles outlined above.  Instead, the first thing step is bring all the organizations together to talk about their issues and trade ideas with each other, both to build relationships between the organizations and to empower the knowledge that people already bring to the table.  This can also help identify knowledge gaps that the group can then collectively work to fill.  Perhaps no one there really knows about databases and so they start a process to educate themselves in their options, perhaps to the point of developing enough expertise among the organizations that they can design and manage their own databases.  As the other organization talks about its need to communicate with its members, they may discover that the more efficient mechanism of e-mail will actually be less efficient as fewer members pay any attention to the mass e-mails.  Old fashioned phone calls may be, in the end, much more efficient because more people actually get the information even though they take more time.  \r\n\r\nThe processes illustrated above require a much longer time frame to complete, and require much more time of community members and organizations.  Importantly, however, they produce much greater and more sustained capacity in the community.', 'Within the field of community informatics, achieving lasting community empowerment requires that community informaticians practice the principles of building the communitys information power, and their relational power, to build their public power.  Doing so means making sure that community members can find, use, and control information tools and build relationships among themselves in the process.  The result will be stronger, more information self-sufficient communities that can build a stronger and better informed democratic society.', NULL, 863, 833, '2006-10-24 05:41:19', '2006-12-21 08:16:19', NULL, NULL, 'University of Wisconsin', NULL, 364, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

While vote counting sounds straightforward, ensuring the accurate counting of votes in an entire country is quite difficult. Many obstacles can obstruct the democratic process including inadequate access to the voting process, inaccurate counting, late results, and results that are not convincing to the electorate. Some of these obstacles are structural, others are due to human error while others result from intentional manipulation and intimidation. Computers, which seem to offer the promise of increased speed and accuracy of collecting and counting votes accompanied by the possibility of decreased costs, offer new challenges to the legitimacy of the voting process, including high-tech election fraud.', 'Democratic states offer their inhabitants the important potential for self-governance. Their legitimacy and their effectiveness suffer when the actuality falls too short of the ideal.

National democracy is the means of generating government for almost all industrialized nations. Furthermore, it is the stated objective of the world\'s great economic powers to eventually instigate national democracy for all the world\'s nations. For this and many other reasons, democracy is the most effective approach to producing legitimate government. \r\n\r\nDemocracies by definition face three major tasks: This pattern is concerned with the second task, determining the \"will of the people\" while others concern themselves with informing the \"will of the people\" and implementing the \"will of the people.\" Any deviation in any phase of the process calls into question the entire process. A nomination process that unfairly denies the nomination of certain people poisons the entire process; how can the voting itself then be meaningful when the candidates on the ballot are the product of a corrupt systems?\r\n\r\nWhile the forms that democracies assume vary widely, voting is a key component of each. Thus, the process by which the votes of the people are gathered and counted is critical to the government\'s claims of legitimacy, and to the continued faith of the people in their government. \r\n\r\nVoting is nearly always a critical milestone in the process of determining the people\'s will. Voting is the critical culmination of an ongoing deliberative process where decisions are actually made: between, for example, candidates vying for a position or for a new proposal to support or limit something. Because voting often determines significant issues it is often subject to immense attention and pressure. While some of this pressure is normal politicking (which varies from place to place), other is unethical, illegal and unfair. The voting process presents an irresistible opportunity for people who want things to go their way regardless of issues of fairness or legality. At the same time the voting process seems to offer innumerable opportunities for unfair interventions at nearly every stage. \r\n\r\nElections vary from place to place, in jurisdiction, in primary or final (general) elections, in selecting officials from candidates or approving or disapproving legislative changes, and most kinds of elections have a whole range of complex activities associated with them. The best recommendation depends on the goals. Beyond that, one can talk about things to avoid. So an \"antipattern\" is easier than a pattern, if a pattern is a kind of recommendation. In every case we still want \"fair elections\" however. \r\n \r\nThe expression \"Free and Fair Elections\" originated in the first post-apartheid elections in South Africa in 1994. The idea is that the outcome should be generated by a process that gives people free access to their franchise, then fairly calculates the result.\r\n\r\nHow can Fair Elections be guaranteed? What technology and administration are required to support national democracy? How can elections be trusted? What danger signs of unfair elections can we detect? What recommendations can we make? While vote counting sounds straightforward, ensuring the accurate counting of votes in an entire country is quite difficult. The requirements and constraints associated with Fair Elections introduce numerous challenges. Voters must have adequate access to the voting process, and this access must not be politically biased. The vote counting must be accurate. The results must be produced promptly.\r\n\r\nElections present a special problem, in that it must be ensured that voter person voted at most once, and each voter\'s votes were accurately counted. However, the votes of any particular voter must remain forever secret. This combination of assured accuracy and secrecy is very unusual outside of voting.\r\n\r\nElections produce results which are just vote totals (plus undervotes if they are permitted and overvotes if they are possible). Results imply outcomes: who (or what) won. Results have two metrics of quality: (1) accuracy (which obviously can\'t be measured directly) measures how closely reported results match true results; and (2) confidence (which is closely related to \"transparency\") measures the feeling in the electorate that the reported results are correct. \r\n\r\nTotal accuracy and no confidence is about as good (or as bad) as the reverse, but they lead to very different kinds of bad. What one wants is an elections process that, for an affordable cost, produces outcomes that are very rarely wrong, even though everybody recognizes that results are seldom perfectly correct. \r\n\r\nAlso, the results must be worthy of confidence. It\'s useless to produce a perfectly accurate result, if people are not persuaded that it is accurate. So there must be good reason to believe the election results. The election process must be conducted in public view, and each step of the process, as well as the process as a whole, must be comprehensible to most ordinary voters. Non-partisan officials should monitor the entire process and voting equipment should be based on open specifications and untarnished by partisan and commercial interests. The chain of custody must be carefully maintained and documented for a wide variety of materials including ballots, unvoted ballot stock, poll books, and so on.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this must be accomplished on a limited budget.

A recent legal needs survey had revealed that 87% of all low income people in the state who had civil legal problems were unable to secure legal help, and that residents of rural counties had substantially less access to technology-based resources than their urban counterparts. Therefore the overriding intent of the effort was to develop, implement and institutionalize principles within all justice system agencies to increase access to justice system information, resources and services for all, and especially those who most need it.', 'Currently, technology is creating opportunities for people to use their home or nearby library branch or community center to find out about, initiate or respond to court or other law related needs, obligations or requirements, communicate and exchange documents with their legal service provider or others in or associated with the legal system less expensively, using less time and effort, without having to travel to a central city, and with less time away from work or other necessary resources. This can be especially important for the elderly, persons with disabilities, persons with limited financial means, and those who cant afford to miss time from work for reasons of financial need or jeopardizing their employment. Similarly, a person with limited mobility or hearing may be able to get information electronically about his or her rights as a tenant; a victim of domestic violence can learn on the Internet what she can do and in fact be able to start the legal process of protecting herself. The courts and other parts of the justice system can operate more productively and less expensively, making court and legal records and information more readily available, and receive filings, fees, documents and information, all electronically.\r\n\r\nHowever, the means of using these very possibilities also create the risk of worsening old barriers or erecting new barriers to access, causing greater disparities. While the opportunities described above seem positive, these innovations assume access to a computer, reasonable proficiency at using them and their necessary software programs, reading capability, fluency in English and sufficient phone or cable and electricity availability and capacity at affordable cost to support sufficient connections and streams of information and interactivity. Without all of that, those who have the tools and means, the proficiency and the necessary infrastructure available get further ahead, and those without fall further behind in having the justice system work for them. The lack of equality gets greater, not less.\r\n\r\nOn December 4, 2004, the Washington State Supreme Court became the first court in the United States, perhaps the world, to formally adopt by Court Order, a set of authoritative principles to guide the use of technology in its justice system. The stated purpose was to ensure that the planning, design, development, implementation and use of new technologies and the management of existing technologies by the justice system and associated organizations protects and advances the fundamental right of equal access to justice. Over a three-and-a-half year period, the Washington State Access to Justice Board drew on the input and involvement of a diverse group of approximately 200 people and organizations from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds to develop formal Access to Justice Technology Principles to serve as the practical operating norm for justice system organizations and entities throughout the state.\r\n\r\nThe Access to Justice Technology Principles broadly define access to justice as the meaningful opportunity to: (1) assert a claim or defense and to create, enforce, modify, or discharge a legal obligation in any forum; (2) acquire the procedural or other information necessary to improve the likelihood of a just result; (3) participate in the conduct of proceedings as a witness or juror; and (4) acquire information about the activities of courts or other dispute resolution bodies. Access to justice, moreover, must include timeliness, affordability and transparency.\r\n\r\nBriefly paraphrased, the six Access to Justice Technology Principles are:\r\n\r\n1. Requirement of access to justice: Introduction of technology or changes in the use of technology must not reduce access or participation and, whenever possible, shall advance such access and participation;\r\n\r\n2. Technology and just results: The justice system shall use and advance technology to achieve the objective of a just process by impartial and well-informed decision makers and reject, minimize, or modify any use that reduces the likelihood of achieving that objective;\r\n\r\n3. Openness and privacy: Technology should be designed to meet the dual responsibilities of the justice system of being open to the public and protecting personal privacy;\r\n\r\n4. Assuring a neutral forum: All appropriate means shall be used to ensure the existence of neutral, accessible, and transparent forums which are compatible with new technologies\r\n\r\n5. Maximizing public awareness and use: The justice system should promote ongoing public knowledge and understanding of the tools afforded by technology to access justice\r\n\r\n6. Best practices: Those governed by these principles shall utilize best practices procedures or standards to guide the use of technology so as to protect and enhance access to justice and promote equality of access and fairness.\r\n\r\nA broad-based interdisciplinary implementation strategy group then developed a set of practical strategies and initiatives to transform the principles from the words of a court-ordered statement of vision into a pervasive operational reality through the state justice system. Once the principles are truly institutionalized in justice organizations, then, as a matter of ordinary routine, the design for every new technology project would incorporate accessibility and usability and increase transparency of and information about the justice system for all users, especially those who are or may be excluded or underserved as well as those experiencing any barrier to accessing justice system services. Essential actions include: (1) Development and maintenance of a Web-based Resource Bank; (2) Initial and ongoing communication to and training for justice system and associated agencies about the ATJ Technology Principles and available resources for implementation; (3) Demonstration projects; (4) Public awareness and usable information. Additional requirements address policy-level governance and guidance as well as ensuring the continuing relevance, effectiveness and use of the Principles over time.', 'A great deal has been said and written about what has come to be called The Digital Divide, both domestically and internationally. Respect for and use of the rule of law is an essential way to move to a less divided, more equitable society and world. Accessible quality justice for all individuals and groups is a recognized worldwide value that crosses cultural as well as geographic lines. Meaningful access to justice can and does empower people to be part of creating their own just societies. This effort is the first such undertaking, and can provide a useful example that can be adapted and used not only in other places, but in other sectors of basic public need, such as access to health care, access to food, access to safety, and other essentials.', NULL, 803, 475, '2006-11-19 18:06:12', '2006-11-09 07:06:54', NULL, NULL, 'Wash State Access to Justice Tech Principles Comm', NULL, 61, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

It is one of a number of patterns that can be followed in the other situations.', 'Current public consultation is deficient in a number of ways. Few people have the time or language skills to respond in writing to 20-page consultation documents. It is mainly professionals with a financial interest who do so. Rarely are public meetings attended by more than a few local retired people. The language of the documents is often obscure and couched in public sector jargon. The questions asked are the ones the officials feel safe asking, not the ones local communities would ask. The style is not one that engages the interest of anyone who is not a committed activist, let alone young people.\r\n\r\nThis has become very clear in places, such as devolved regions of the UK, where public consultation has suddenly grown very fast. In Northern Ireland, equality legislation forced 120 public authorities to consult on how they were planning to measure the equality impact (gender, race, religion, age, class) of each of their policies over the next 5 years. This led to 120 long documents being sent to the same 80-120 voluntary organizations, with 8 weeks to reply. Their choice was to ignore them (whereupon the officials could continue to do what they had done before) or to spend every day drafting replies, with very little time to talk to the people who would be directly affected.\r\n\r\nContrast this with experimental use of ICTs in public consultations in the Netherlands, the use of Internet chat to hold discussions between young people in East Belfast (the only neutral venue at the time) on human rights, and research into on-line mediation support systems in Germany (for planning disputes).\r\n\r\nCan we design an appropriate use of software to support electronic public consultation that improves both its effectiveness in reaching different people, and its efficiency in controlling information overload and consultation fatique?\r\n\r\nConsider consultation as an inter-organizational learning process. Knowledge is transfered between citizens and government, as they learn from each other. In particular, the policy makers need to better understand the needs, life experiences, and preferences of different actors in civil society (sometimes called stakeholders). In doing that, they act as both apprentices, learning from citizens, and mediators, managing disputes between different groups of citizens.\r\n\r\nWhen there are strong disagreements between different groups, a mediation or negotiation model is appropriate, based on what we understand about dispute resolution in communities that have been affected by conflict. This can be used to build a pattern of the process, and identify technologies to support different stages in that process.', 'Considering public consultation as a series of mediation and negotiation processes, it should be possible to participatively design software that supports these human processes, in the stages identified in the table below.\r\n<TABLE BORDER=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" WIDTH=\"100%\">\r\n  <TR>\r\n    <TH ROWSPAN=\"2\" WIDTH=\"20%\" BGCOLOR=\"#00FFFF\">Level of groupware needed to support stage</TH>\r\n    <TH COLSPAN=\"8\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\" BGCOLOR=\"#CCCCCC\">Stage of process</TH>\r\n  </TR>\r\n  <TR> \r\n    <TH COLSPAN=\"2\" WIDTH=\"20%\" BGCOLOR=\"#CCCCCC\">1.

Budget development is in fact a \"political\" act, with \"winners\" and \"losers\" most of whom never participate in the process.', 'Properly understood, budgets and the budget development process are tools through which social values are expressed and manifested in useful public activity. This pattern explains the importance of budgeting and encourages participation in all stages of budget development.\r\n\r\nPublic budgeting connects to several other patterns. For example: participating in the creation of budgets is an ideal way to foster <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=1\">Civic Intelligence</a> (pattern 1);  joint budget development helps create <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=9\">Shared Vision</a>  (pattern 9); public budgeting via online tools is an example of <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=26\">Using Collaborative Technologies for Civic Accountability</a> (pattern 26); and understanding budgets is one aspect of <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=293\">Power Research</a> (pattern 293).', 'A fundamental step in the life of any organization is the design of a budget. The decisions which are made early in the process (e.g., What is to be budgeted for? What are the sources of income? Who is to be paid? What are the categories of effort which are highly compensated and what effort is to be considered voluntary?) often set core parameters for the future, and impact not only the ways in which time and money are spent, but also the values and reputation of the organization, and even its soul. \r\n\r\nBut budgeting is often treated as a \"technical\" process which should be handled by experts rather than as a political activity in which many people should be invited and encouraged to participate. One way in which budgets can be more easily discussed publicly is to use online tools to disseminate budget information, host public discussions, and create sample budget variations -- though from our experience, we believe this should be coupled with face-to-face discussions whenever possible.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.tve.org/lifeonline/index.cfm?aid=1110\">best-known example of participatory budgeting is found in Porto Alegre, Brasil</a>, where community residents (now numbering in the thousands) have cooperated since 1989 in annual deliberations about the allocation of a portion of the municipal budget. Poor citizens are vastly more engaged in this process than is typical in budgeting processes, and increasing proportions of the city\'s revenue have been directed towards improving the most impoverished parts of Porto Alegre. While there is some disagreement over how much of this outcome to attribute to the participatory budgeting process, there is no doubt about the increased sensitivity of all citizens to the importance of budgeting decisions. In June, 1996, the United Nations declared the \"popular administration\" of Porto Alegre as one of forth urban innovations at the Second Conference on Human Settlements.\r\n\r\nVarious <a href=\"http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/\">related experiments in participatory budgeting</a> have taken place on several continents since Porto Alegre, typically fine-tuned to local circumstances, with an evolving set of principles promoting conditions that enhance the effectiveness of the process.\r\n\r\nSeveral important attempts at involving typically excluded citizens in the budget allocation process have occurred in the U.S. -- often during progressive periods. Two of the most significant were the Affirmative Neighborhood Information Program during Mayor Harold Washington\'s tenure in Chicago (Kretzmann, 1992), which failed to survive successor administrations; and the Seattle Public Schools multi-year experiment in decentralized, \"school-based\" budgeting, supported by an online budgeting tool (Halaska, 2000). \r\n\r\nIn the Seattle experiment, a vastly increased proportion of district resources was redistributed from the central administrative offices to individual schools. School principals were encouraged to engage in a public budgeting process where trade-offs (e.g. reduced class size vs after-school music programs) were actively debated -- both in public meetings and online. The process was messy because \"democracy is messy\" and was controversial at every stage, in part because it surfaced hidden assumptions about core values in public education. Some participants believed that this process had the potential to provoke a fundamental rethinking of the purposes of the education process itself.\r\n\r\nKey findings from the Chicago and Seattle experiments align with the principles of Porto Alegre and elsewhere. For example, it is important that significantly different approaches to budgeting such as these become so embedded that they cannot readily be set aside by later regimes. Equally critical is that traditional budget staff be convinced about the importance of participatory budgeting. While philosophical and political discussions about larger scale budget issues can be done without technical assistance, detailed information about current costs and funding formulas typically reside with budget staff. Without their support, key budget information can be difficult to obtain. Moreover, while the ideology of participatory budgeting has wide appeal, critical studies should be undertaken to determine under what circumstances participatory strategies have lasting effects and whether, in the case of participatory budgeting for example, systemic changes such as in the labor market must occur for poorer citizens to benefit from these new strategies in the long run.', 'Budgets for organizations in the public sphere should be developed openly and inclusively, in public meetings and using publicly accessible online tools. Budget assumptions should be discussed, and rethinking of assumptions, priorities, and allocations should be encouraged, no matter how far they depart from current practice. At every stage, the results of the process should be made public for feedback and refinement. Attention should be paid to what has been learned from experience (for example, about the wisdom of convincing traditional budget staff of the utility of public budgeting), and studies of the long-range impact of participatory budgeting are essential.', NULL, 395, 827, '2006-10-30 15:03:39', '2006-10-30 07:34:01', 'social design', NULL, 'University of Washington Evans School', NULL, 220, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

An international cash transaction tax could help the global good by raising substantial funds to support the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations.  This tax also has the potential of stemming damaging speculative attacks on the currencies of middle-income developing countries aiding in their financial stability.  National transaction taxes have also been suggested to create even handedness and fairness by allowing the wealthy to carry the larger share of the tax burden.', 'The implementation of transaction taxes are seen as a way to broaden the tax base by the collection of tax on the voluntary exchange of money that is not currently taxed.  Primary examples of this are the purchase and sale of stocks, bonds, and foreign exchange transactions.  Transaction taxes have been proposed on both national and international levels for various reasons.', 'Many support the idea of an international currency transaction tax (ICTT) on voluntary currency transactions as an innovative financing tool to raise money for international development.  One of the most urgent local problems that needs to be addressed is starvation in the sub-Sahara region of Africa, though The United Nations has defined several areas of need around the world with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \"The MDG\'s are as follows: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and, develop a global partnership for development.\" (Spratt 2005)  The G8 have also pledged money for the achievement of the MDG\'s by the year 2015.  Whether the G8 money becomes a reality or not, there is still a huge need for funding to help implement these important goals.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a transaction tax has been around for a long time and was presented in London in 1936 by James Maynard Keating.  However, a transaction tax is commonly known as a Tobin Tax, named after Nobel laureate James Tobin.  In 1970 James Tobin recommended the use of a transaction tax to discourage speculation in the foreign exchange (FX) market.  Reducing speculation has the expected result of lowering market volatility.  This volatility can be very damaging to developing countries when their currencies are unstable.  In this way the transaction tax has a second development function in bringing mid-income countries in line with underlying fundamentals that promote long term investment in their country. India has already implemented its own national transaction tax on securities trades as a means to simplify the tax regime and to reduce speculation in Indian financial markets.  \r\n\r\nEven in wealthier nations like the USA the idea of instituting a transaction tax is floated as a means to broaden the tax base, delete the marginal tax, and overhaul a complex tax system.  This type of national transaction tax allows the wealthy to carry a larger share of the tax burden based on their easy access to financial markets and the less fortunate to carry a smaller burden in relation to their lower income and assets.\r\n\r\nThere are many critics of the Tobin tax.  Some economists say the reduction of speculation also means the reduction of liquidity which can have its own damaging effects.  Other economists have produced studies to show that curbing speculation does not reduce currency volatility.  Often critics are those who would be most effected by paying the new tax and their criticisms feed their own selfish interests.  However, there are many around the world, including wealthy people who would be affected by the tax, that like the charitable development that could be funded by this type of financing.  \r\n\r\nNew technology and communications systems along with the internet make it possible to collect a transaction tax with efficiency and make avoidance extremely difficult.  Electronic technology of the bank clearing system already in place could be digitally fitted with a financial equivalent of the EZ pass that is now used to speed traffic through toll booths on highways.  International payment and collection systems like the CLS (continuously linked settlement) Bank already link automated domestic LVPS (large value payment systems) making the collection of a transaction tax a realistic idea.', 'By allowing a transaction tax at either a national or international level, disparities between the rich and poor can be mitigated to some degree.  The poor won\'t bare an over proportionate amount of tax in relation to their incomes.  Needs of people in developing countries can be served by taxes reaped from the wealthiest who perform large national or international transactions.  Financial markets can also be strengthened in developing countries creating a win win situtation.', NULL, 552, 785, '2006-10-23 10:23:43', '2006-10-22 14:09:20', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 351, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This figure surpasses by far the total of direct foreign investment and overseas development aid.  Many countries, in fact, around the world, now rely on remittances as a major source of foreign exchange.  World Bank technical reports fret about how best to leverage remittance income.  While remittance transfers has become a growth industry (e.g. banking the unbanked), public policy has to date been reluctant to regulate this phenomenal resource flow apart from the usual concerns about money laundering.  Remittance transfers grow annually, but this growth curve is not indefinite.\r\n\r\nLow-paid \"guest workers\" (many working \"illegally\", i.e. sans documents) in richer countries send a portion of their paychecks to their families back home.  Their cheap labor allows many industries to remain competitive.  In the recipient countries, this foreign exchange often represents a large percentage of GDP.  While the amount of money is large, the percentage of funds siphoned off as commissions at various points during the transfer process is also significant, but steadily dropping.  Five years ago the average transfer cost was often close to 15%, whereas today it is around 5.5%.  Nevertheless, there is considerable room for further transfer cost reductions via innovative information technologies and regulatory reform.  Remittance transfers from the migrant refugees from recent structural adjustment policies and \"market failures\" represent the flip side of global capital flows.', 'The poor countries generally have few job opportunities and their \"best and brightest\" leave the country in what amounts to a new form of resource extraction (if not a new form of inverse \"colonialism\"). This process seems to be self-perpetuating, as the respective national Diaspora circuits become consolidated and young men and increasingly women as well migrate Northbound, to the United States or Europe, or Westbound to the Gulf States, upon reaching adulthood.  Migration patterns may vary significantly within countries.  Village cultures, family and ritual life has adapted to these new circumstances, often less than a generation old.  Transnational communities are now the norm in many regions of Mesoamerica, Mexico to Nicaragua, the Caribbean microstates, regional pockets in northern South America and sub-Saharan Africa, amongst South Africa', 'National elites quietly applaud these incoming resources; unfortunately, some would like to tax them as income as some US state legislatures also propose.  This money is an aggregate of private, family funds that paradoxically provoke a positive multiplier effect for local merchants and economies, while reducing somewhat demands for social services from public funds and improving the balance of payments in national accounts.  Remittance flows in hard currency reinforce central banks stock of foreign exchange, in effect reducing interest rates for the minority with access to credit.  Banks and money transfer operators (MTOs to the financial community) now accept foreign government identification cards (e.g. Mexicos Matrícula Consular ) thereby bypassing strict migration controls in some countries.  Global remittance flows may be a contemporary form of social Darwinism whereby \"remittances seem to be taking care of local needs.\"  While in the job and remittance-generating host countries, workers from poor countries are often exploited, denied basic rights and services while paying local taxes, and increasingly, demonized by racist seal the borders ultranationalists. \r\n\r\nMexico has taken the lead in leveraging migrants remittances via a 3 for 1 program now operating in 16 states of its federal system.  Begun in Zacatecas in 1992, for each dollar a migrant organization earmarks for investment in public improvements in specific locations back home, the municipal, state and federal governments contribute another dollar.  Gradually, many municipios are paving their plazas, building sidewalks, refurbishing the churches, adding bathrooms to primary schools, etc.  This program can be exported and other countries are discussing its implementation.\r\n\r\nThe emergence of these remittance economies is a function of emigration patterns that attest to the failures and limitations of the capitalist development model.  Near monopoly MTOs (e.g. Western Union and Money Gram) dominated the early phase, but the profits to be made attracted many new players, including regional companies and most recently, commercial banks and credit unions.  Workers deliver cash to a MTO receiving window, often in franchises located in small businesses and storefronts in migrant urban neighborhoods or small towns next to labor intensive industries (furniture, poultry and meat packing, fruit and vegetable farms).  The licensed MTO moves the funds via their electronic network, situating the remittance at the assigned location on the receiving end in the migrants home country.  Often the remitter is unaware of the foreign exchange rate used (US dollars or Euros to his/her local currency), and MTOs have been sued for offering exchange rates well below the market value on the day of the transaction.  In addition to service commissions, exchange rate spreads are a major component of MTOs bottom line.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, undocumented workers often use a fake Social Security identification card and number.  Employers accept them at face value and send obligatory salary deductions to the Social Security Administration that deposits these funds in a special Earnings Suspense Fund (ESF).  This account now receives over USD$7 billion a year, a significant sum that will never be reclaimed by workers in the future.  The ESF is a de facto migrant subsidy to the US social security capital budget.  It remains an open question if this amount equals or is less than the value of social services non-tax paying migrants receive at the state and local levels.\r\n\r\nThis pattern of massive remittance transfers can be more transparent and cost efficient while leveraging resources for migrant families and organizations committed to growth back home.  Information technology can substantially reduce remittance transfer costs and improve transparency if both financial and telecommunications regulatory reforms were in place.  Experts in the field admit that commissions and exchange rate spreads totaling 2.5% of the amount sent home allows for a healthy profit for MTOs.  Commercial and financial elites, both in the North and the South, at present profiting from the poor, are probably not going to willfully innovate in this fashion.  Accelerating the citizenship process and then, mobilizing former migrant voter turnout may lead to immigration policy reforms in the North.  Simultaneously, migrant organizations need to continue to fight for their rights, services access, job safety, and civic respect in the framework of each respective national \"guest worker\" policy.  Also, there is immense potential in using the power that can be derived from the aggregated sums of small proportions of remittances to bring pressure to bear on political elites in the home countries.  This is beginning to happen in Mesoamerica where returning migrants manage collective remittances, run for public office, win, often reconfigure local priorities and lobby for reforms at other levels.  The power of leveraging this amount of money via political lobbying and policy reform will have impacts both in the North and South.', 'Non-profit foundations working with migrant organizations could set up alternative networks of cost plus transfer mechanisms and otherwise protect remittance transactions while lowering costs still more.  Stored value cards will play a strategic role in this process.  Voice over Internet Protocol free or low cost phone calls will contribute to lower communications costs, a significant aspect of each migration circuit.  International financial institutions could offer matching funds for specific investments back home.  There is room for innovation and experimentation for migrant organizations and their supporting transnational communities.  Emerging remittance economies may reconfigure local politics over time.', NULL, 767, 828, '2006-08-28 12:52:51', '2006-09-27 21:37:44', NULL, NULL, 'Universidad Metropolitana', NULL, 354, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Much of this information depicts good health in terms of vigilance against the failings of our own bodies. This serves to create dependency on a high tech, commodity health system.', 'The style of language and the content of information are very important in how information makes people perceive the world. Authors in many fields have noted patterns of communication that create distrust and enforce dependency by emphasizing danger from external, uncontrollable forces. If people have a sense of helplessness in the face of this threat, they do not act upon their own feelings and perceptions.', 'Negative language has the effect of emphasizing threats, magnifying fears, and creating dependency. Reminding people of their mortality tends to make them hold more closely to traditional culture (Pyszczynski, Solomon, & Greenberg, 2003); this has implications for mental health, and can also be used to influence mass opinion and behavior. A recent example is the US administrations use of language to create fear and mistrust among the public by creating the specter of a constant external threat (Brooks, 2003). \r\n\r\nMuch health information, especially advertising from hospital corporations and pharmaceutical companies, uses this technique. A paternalistic (doctor knows best) and commodity-driven medical system produces an endless stream of information that encourages the perception that natural processes, such as growing older or pregnancy, are fraught with danger. This inhibits the spread of health information that is not based on the treatments that this system has to offer.\r\n\r\nLanguage may not only be negative; it can also be empty (Brooks, 2003); complex issues are broken down into broad statements with little meaning. In health care information, this pattern of communication places the cause of ill health on the individual. The complexity of individuals relationships to the world they live in and the effects on individual health of pollution, poverty, and unhealthy social norms and values are ignored. People come to construe healthy behavior in terms of dependency on a medical industry that constantly invents not only new cures, but new diseases for the cures it already possesses (Blech, 2006). \r\n\r\nEmpty language is like empty calories. It tastes good and you can eat a lot of it, but you dont obtain much benefit. A great deal of health information tempts us to feel that we are well-informed. We are bombarded by advertising and public health campaigns that do little more than create mistrust of the inherent healthy processes we possess. To reduce complex health issues to taking a pill ignores peoples emotional needs and the complex connection between body and mind; instead it emphasizes the negative aspects of their health. \r\n\r\nThe use of estrogen replacement in post-menopausal women illustrates this. Estrogen replacement was pushed on women as a way if combating the problems of growing old such as osteoporosis, heart disease, memory loss and drying skin. The unspoken message was that there was something wrong with growing old that taking medication could correct it. Preventative approaches, that emphasized a lifetime of healthy behaviors and the inherent correctness of aging, were ignored.\r\n\r\nIn pattern 47, Health Center, Alexander et al. (1977) describe a medical system that emphasizes sickness over health. By contrast, they show the Pioneer Health Center in Peckham, an experiment from the 1930s, as an example of medical care that focuses on health instead of sickness. In the same manner, health information must distinguish between healing and medicine. We need to hear messages of what is right with us and what needs to be done to stay in touch with the inherent health of our bodies.\r\n\r\nMany alternative health practices, such as yoga, polarity treatment, or acupuncture focus on the inherent healthiness of the body. In these practices, the underlying concept is on healing, the natural process by which the body repairs itself. The rise of alternatives to conventional medicine reflects, in part, the lack of substance people feel from the information they receive after a visit to a doctor. Health-related discussion forums, that include both lay and professional perspectives but avoid the disease-mongering (Marshall & Aldhous, 2006) influence of industry funding, offer a way to make sense of information from various health related sources without falling victim to negative language and information; people put information into the context of everyday life and validate positive perceptions of themselves. This type of information has substance to it, not only because it is active rather than passive; it has the positive effect of engaging people in independent, creative thinking.', 'Health information should emphasize the idea that people are inherently healthy. It must inspire trust in the bodys ability to heal itself, once a healthy path has been taken.

Keynote address to Microsoft employees and experts on disabilities and technology, Redmond, Washington, February 19, 1998', 'Just as buildings are built with accessibility factored into their architecture from the ground up, so too must WWW and Internet architecture factor in accessibility initiatives from the outset to ensure equitable access to online resources. Accessibility standards such as the World Wide Web Consortiums Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C WAI) Guidelines offer developers guidelines for designing inclusive information infrastructures.   \r\n\r\nThe WAI guidelines provide a blueprint for ensuring that ICTs used to access them are accessible to all. They are meant to prevent digital divides from growing disproportionately to the continued use of new technologies.  By taking into account accessibility considerations, people with physical and/or learning disabilities are encouraged to become producers of information, and not just passive consumers.  This is an important point, and a distinction worth making.  It is one thing to ensure that ICTs and online media are rendered accessible for those using assistive devices (screen readers, special keyboards, mouse devices).  It is another thing entirely to ensure that people with disabilities can actively participate in creating content for the online world. A key factor of accessibility is ensuring that those with disabilities can access both the information produced for and in the electronic world, and equally as important, can also access and use the tools needed to produce this content.  \r\n\r\nHere we can return to our accessibility <I>to</I> and <I>of</I>distinction.  Accessibility <I>of</I> means making electronic information accessible according to the W3Cs WAI guidelines.  Accessibility <I>to</I> ICTs means making the tools required to produce electronic content accessible also.  These two taken together means ensuring that all people, regardless of ability, can participate equally in the production of the network society, in the information produced and broadcast via communication technologies.  Creating knowledge from this information is what defines the network society.  To our accessibility bifurcation we must add the ability to assess, to decode, and to use information, central components of what we can call digital literacy. Ensuring this knowledge benefits from all voices ensures that this network society is inclusive, representational, and reflective of the society at large.\r\n\r\n<strong>Have You Unplugged Your Mouse Today?</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat exactly does it mean to make Web content accessible?  A review of accessibility issues by various disability groups will enable us to understand the barriers faced by a significant proportion of the population.  It is useful to remember that the percentage of people with either a physical or learning disability that may impair access is around 20+% (54 million people in the US alone) (Waddell, 1999), and grows significantly according to age group. \r\n\r\nHow Many People Have Disabilities (US)? \r\n\r\nAge Group	Proportion of People with Disabilities\r\n0 -- 21		10%\r\n22 -- 44	14.9%\r\n45 -- 54	24.5%\r\n55 -- 64	36.3%\r\n65 -- 79	47.3%\r\n80+		71.5%\r\n\r\nVisual and hearing impairments are among the disabilities associated with ageing. U.S. Census Bureau  (Qtd. in Accessibility in Web Design )\r\n\r\nDisabilities that may impair access include visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive impairments. To give you an idea of what barriers these users face, here is a list of some difficulties by disability group:\r\n\r\nVision --include blind and low vision people who use screen readers to access electronic information. Items that may be inaccessible or cause difficulty for vision impaired people include: \r\n·	Some Java elements\r\n·	Browse buttons \r\n·	Poorly labeled form elements \r\n·	Inconsistencies in layout \r\n·	Inconsistencies in language \r\n·	Surprise popup windows\r\n·	Multiple frames and nested tables\r\n·	Other problems included the illogical display of steps required for task completion, and confusing and ambiguous use of terminology \r\n\r\nHearing -- hearing impaired people need closed captioning for audio so this information will not be lost to the hearing impaired. \r\n\r\nMobility -- people with mobility impairments may use screen readers, laser and infrared head mouse devices, special keyboards and other products to access online and electronic information.  They face problems similar to those encountered by the visually impaired.\r\n\r\nCognitive and Language/ Learning Disabilities -- people with these kinds of special needs use a variety of access devices to help improve access and cognition.  Difficulty with language usage, the manner in which text and links are encoded, and the use of colors, fonts, sounds, graphics, all may have an adverse impact on LD people. Other issues include:\r\n·	Inconsistencies in layout and language\r\n·	Absence of alternative formats (no redundant display of information)\r\n·	Difficulty with multi-step activities\r\n·	Confusing terminology (e.g. \"click here\")\r\n·	Complexities in page/site payout and lack of clear and consistent instructions or other navigational aids.\r\n\r\nOther factors affecting all disabled users include:\r\n·	Lack of experience with Internet/WWW technologies\r\n·	Lack of experience with assistive and adaptive technologies\r\n·	Operating system, software conflicts and difficulties\r\n·	Sites and technologies that do not support alternative access devices and strategies', '<strong>Solution:</strong>\r\n\r\nFollowing the W3C WAI guidelines is one way to ensure that all online information is accessible to persons with disabilities or to those who rely on adaptive and assistive technologies. Voluntary compliance on the part of all online providers will help the evolving standards of the WWW keep pace with the population.  However, it is imperative to seek ways to encourage the accessible design of web materials from their first iteration. Inclusive design practices must take an active role in directing the development of accessible technology.\r\n\r\nEqually as important is the need to educate all users and developers of ICTs on accessibility.  This includes focusing on the ways in which the network society -- the culture in which ICTs are embedded -- can best respond to the needs of all people.  This means looking at the social contexts in which technology sits, and examining the broader issues of access and living in a culture increasingly dominated by various mediating technologies. It means focusing less on individual accommodations and more on providing inclusive network infrastructures from the ground up.  We need to develop a cultural or environmental approach to providing accessible ICTs and online environments.  By building in electronic curbcuts from the ground up, online media and ICTs offer an inclusive opportunity for all people to participate in digital information exchange.  Accessibility affects us all:  Some of us directly; all of us indirectly.', NULL, 295, 880, '2006-10-24 20:04:51', '2006-11-12 22:58:58', NULL, NULL, 'University of Toronto', NULL, 136, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This is not because the payments to authors have risen dramatically.  Far from it.  Nor have publishing costs skyrocketed.  Instead, there has been a dramatic consolidation in the publishing industry along with skyrocketing profits, far faster than, for instance, the general rises in the cost of living.  In addition, with the consolidation in the retail bookstores as well as publishers, the publishes concentrate their efforts disproportionately on textbooks that will have large markets.  Moreover, even if publishing profits were driven to zero, there would still be many people in the world who would not be able to gain access to important scientific and scholarly information in the form of paper books and journals.', 'There are many scholars, scientists, and teachers in a wide variety of fields.  Only a very small percentage gain a significant amount of income from the publication of their scholarly works.  In fact, in many cases, authors have to pay page charges to have their work published. Publishing companies make a lot of money.  Yet, people who could gain greatly from the knowledge in books and articles cannot afford them. Not only do most scholars receive little, no, or negative income for publishing their work; the amount of work that they are expected to do has increased,  Not too many years ago, authors sent in a paper manuscript and the publishing companies were responsible for typesetting and copy editing.  Today, most publishers require computer-readable files completely formatted and expect the author to carefully check for typos, grammatical errors, word usage, etc..  In other words, the author now does much of the work that publishers used to do, but all the resultant reduction in costs have been added to the profits of publisher rather than to any benefits to the authors.', 'Probably the best introduction to the important concepts in Open Access (OA) Scholarly Publishing can be found at Peter Suber\'s website: \r\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm\r\nAmong other important points, he debunks some important myths about OA. OA is not cost-free, for instance, although clearly, it can be less expensive than traditional use of a paper publishing company.  Even if not completely cost-free, it can still be free to the readers.  There are a number of different models of funding. In some cases, the authors pay a small fee; in others, institutions pay; in still others (e.g., NSF), granting agencies make OA a condition of acceptance.  It is also pointed out that there is no necessary relationship between quality and whether something is paper published.  OA journals support peer-review, high standards and editing (at least) as easily as paper media.  OA archives typically permit researchers to post non-reviewed white papers, drafts, etc.  OA projects do well to use the OAI metadata standards so that others may search works seamlessly across organizational boundaries. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the best-known current example of open access scholarly publishing is the cooperative project known as the \"Wikipedia\" but there are many others.  MIT is making all its course material available online; MERLOT is a cooperative project across many universities in the United States to share course materials.  There are similar projects in Europe and Canada. \r\n\r\nOne example illustrating some of these concepts is the Global Text Project. THE GLOBAL TEXT PROJECT - Engaging many for the benefit of many more.  While even individuals and libraries in the United States find it difficult to afford books and journals, these items in many in the developed world are completely beyond reach.  In many countries, the price for the textbooks equivalent to the requirements for a single year of undergraduate college is higher than the median gross net income.  The Global Text Project website (http://globaltext.org) states their goal as the provision of a library of 1000 free electronic textbooks for the developing world.  These would comprise all the texts needed for undergraduates in every major.  Many of the participants have experience with creating a free textbook about XML.  The next two planned projects are for texts on management and on Information Technology.  \r\n\r\nThe project seems feasible.  Most scholars in the developed world are relatively wealthy compared with the developing world. Contributing to the education of other parts of the world can ultimately help developing countries lower disease rates and improve economic conditions, lower the probability of civil war, corruption and starvation.  In turn, this increases the chances for more education in a virtuous cycle.  In addition, contributing to such projects offers scholars the opportunity for enhancing their reputation and getting valuable feedback from other colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some advantages to print media.  It is nice to be able to \"own\" an actual book or journal and annotate it.  In some ways, the distinctive covers and form factors of books can serve as a helpful retrieval cue to the material inside in a way that websites typically do not.  However, having books and journals online also has distinct advantages over and above the tremendous difference in costs.  On line books allows one to search for keywords, put related passages on the screen side by side, apply automatic summarization techniques, run software to check spelling, grammar, difficulty level and easily reformat.  On line books can also contain hyperlinks to other scholarly (or non-scholarly) work and websites. \r\n\r\nThere are other significant advantages to Open Source Publishing.  Because the overall price is so much less (less cost and less concern with profit) publishing in a multitude of languages becomes feasible.  In addition, for the same reason, a much wider variety of materials may be published.  By way of contrast, textbook publishers tend to focus their efforts on books for very popular and required courses.\r\n\r\nWhile this discussion has focused so far on the benefits of open source scholarly publishing to potential readers and society generally and has argued that there is little financial disincentive for most scholarly authors, a study by Antelman (2004) indicates that they may actually be substantial benfeits to authors as well. In her study of citations for articles in four fields (philosophy, political science, electrical engineering and mathematics) she found in each case a highly significant difference in favor of open source articles.', 'Provide ways (e.g., via Wikis) for scholars to jointly create and improve scholarly materials, have them peer-reviewed and disseminated to those who can learn and critique the information without always engaging the additional costs and gate-keeping properties of traditional paper publishers.', NULL, 670, 485, '2006-11-12 22:58:58', '2006-11-12 15:03:22', NULL, NULL, 'IBM Research Hawthorne', NULL, 105, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This makes good use of financial resources and allows a scarce and important asset to be brought to where it is most needed and reused continually.\r\n\r\nThe provision of similar traveling computer laboratories, the drivers of which are trained computer literacy educators, could play a similar role in bringing the ICT mountain to the disempowered. Self-contained units with their own power generation ability will grant ICT access to many people in remote locations or simply living in communities which are too poor to support such access in other ways. Encouraging community participation in the program will help to ensure that those in the community who could most benefit by the program will be helped first.

As power and wealth become more concentrated, wealthy people and institutions become more and more dominant in the policy arena. When that happens, local and marginalized voices are not heard; people feel disempowered and disengage further from the political process. \"Ordinary\" people generally stay far from the public policy arena. They feel isolated and are unaware that others are striving towards positive change. When there are public policy successes, they\'re not often shared with other communities and the people at the grassroots who enter the public policy arena often must needlessly reinvent the wheel.', 'As our lifeworld becomes more and more complex governance also grows more complicated. Meanwhile the need for sound policy becomes more essential. There are opportunities for grassroots political engagement for every policy issue that is at stake. Increasingly this will involve the intelligent use of new media and the Internet. Moreover, in this context, the development of the Internet &mdash; and policies regarding citizen use of and oversight of ICT in general &mdash; make these a critical areas in themselves for grassroots public policy development.', 'Public policy determines whether a new library is built &mdash; and <i>where</i> &mdash; and how a new clinic for homeless people is funded &mdash; or <i>not.</i> It even determines to a large degree who has access to communication services and who has the right to control them. Although it is often \"public policy\" which silently promotes or discourages certain public actions, the development, maintenance, use, and, often, the very existence of the \"public policy\" is about as far from \"public\" as can be imagined. \r\n\r\nPolicy is governance. It helps address questions like, How will we live together in a complex society? How will we deal with the problems of our time and how we collectively define what those problems are? Will governance be <i>of the people, by the people, for the people?</i> or will it succumb to the defects resulting from a concentration of power and wealth? This pattern is closely related to Power Research because the information uncovered is likely to be useful in determining how policy is developed and what alternative practices may be effective for developing alternative policies from the grassroots. \r\n\r\nPublic policy often has a technocratic air about it. It\'s often constructed by \"wonks\" just as computer code is produced by \"geeks\" and both geeks and wonks are stereotypically portrayed as social misfits who prefer complicated and artificial arcana to the \"real world\" (of flesh, blood, emotions, etc.). But while it\'s true that policy development (like computer development) does have its degree of inherent complexity (especially as it assumes a final form), an important part of its development is not \"geeky\" at all: it involves the crucial task of determining what one would like to see in society and how it might be encouraged to happen. \r\n\r\nGrassroots public policy development involves local engagement that is generally contrary to top-down approaches. It occurs when the problem and the solution are defined by the active local parties rather than imposed from outside. Jason Corburn (2005) discusses why people &mdash; especially non-professionals working in the local community &mdash; are unlikely to get involved in policy work. <blockquote> \"one difficulty that local knowledge presents is that is insights are often very contextual, while policy-making tends to make general rules. Much of the work on local knowledge is ethnographic and deeply conceptual, and few general patterns or lessons are offered. Advocates of local knowledge have been understandably hesitant to \"scale up\" or generalize their findings and insights &mdash; largely out of fear of inaccurate decontextualizations, oversimplifications and unjustified generalizations.\" </blockquote>Corburn goes on to point out that it isn\'t just local communities who lose out when they\'re excluded from the process. Society at large suffers as well as, interestingly enough, the policy \"wonks\" whose job it is to develop these policies. <blockquote>\"professional decision makers have not found ways to incorporate the important understandings from studies of local knowledge into the more generalized practice of policymaking. Scaling up knowledge from local settings is a necessary task in environmental health because of the extreme heterogeneity in ecosystems and human-environment linkages. But local knowledge can be used to improve environmental-health decisions while maintaining a heightened sensitivity to the contextually specific qualities of this knowledge.\" </blockquote>The W. K. Kellogg Foundation lists four types of public policy (Kellogg Foundation, 2006): statutory (including constitution / charter or laws), fiscal (including annual budgets, acts and resolutions), regulatory (administrative rules), and institutional (such as policy manual and standards, and tenure and appointment). For each public policy type, they describe broad characteristics including scope, applicability, duration, process characteristics and primary policy makers. Note that different jurisdictions will have different public policies and each contains a variety of types. Nevertheless, the public policy landscape of any given jurisdiction can be described and understood with some variation using this framework. Using the typology described above as a way to focus one\'s learning in the public policy arena &mdash; especially as it pertains to one\'s own area of interest &mdash; is usefull for focusing public policy engagement. \r\n\r\nOnce the type of policy to be developed has been established along with at least a rough form for the policy, the plan for implementing the policy should be developed. The process must be considered, including both the formal or legal aspects of the process and the informal, tacit and behind-the-scenes aspects of the process, especially in conjunction with a consideration of the primary policy makers and how they generally operate. \r\n\r\nThe <i>Children\'s Partnership</i> offers \"Six Essential Elements Derived from The Children\'s Partnership\'s Experiences\" that show the basic steps in a process of moving \"from an idea to a successful public policy.\" \r\n\r\n1. RESEARCH BASE that is grounded in what local communities want and need.\r\n2. POLICY PROPOSAL that responds to findings from research &mdash; one that is saleable and scaleable.\r\n3. WAYS TO COMMUNICATE the policy idea effectively.\r\n4. DEMONSTRATION that the policy idea can work in the real world.\r\n5. ORGANIZING / ADVOCACY for the idea &mdash; using strategic partnerships\r\n6. FOLLOW THROUGH TO IMPLEMENTATION of the new policy.\r\n\r\nThe inherent problem of people approaching similar problems from diverse perspectives (and, hence, using different vocabularies) will continue to crop up. People working on similar problems may not find each other or be aware of their respective efforts and intentions. Other questions also need to be addressed: who gets to do what, whose ideas are taken into account, what attitudes (respectful, paternalistic, domineering) prevail, in whose name or on what basis decisions are made, and whether they are enforced or neglected. \r\n\r\nPeople often do not know how to get involved and have limited experience with being effectively involved. They therefore require contexts or channels to guide their participation and an invitation to join the effort. There are numerous sociological and psychological dimensions at play here and people will need to advance in their individual development within this social exercise. \r\n\r\nAlthough face-to-face encounters remain important, tools of the Internet era can be used to facilitate new modes of organizing. For one thing, people can allow for more open spaces for dialogue and engagement. It may also be possible to coordinate with other communities who are involved in similar activities. The Internet can promote the idea of moving decision-making power towards smaller local assemblies while maintaining flexibility and freedom to connect local assemblies. In other words, new online media can allow people and communities to organize more effectively around these principles and values. \r\n\r\nNote also that although some action, procedure or decision might be properly enshrined as part of public policy, it may have very little bearing on how things are actually done. In other words, public policy is only as valid to the degree that it is enforced and/or respected and abided by. The use of this pattern is probably only reasonable to the extent that public policy is actually respected in the setting in which it is intended to be used. For that reason, the reality of the policy\'s actual deployment in society, in addition to any other relevant circumstances surrounding the development and use of the policy, needs to be given special consideration.', 'Public policy should genuinely reflect accumulated public wisdom. The discipline required for policy work must be distributed throughout the body politic in civil discourse, research, and inclusive creative deliberation.

Even within like-minded social change communities, participants can find themselves in conflict with each other.  To negotiate over disagreements on the basis that only one of the affected parties can gain at the expense of all the others is to perpetuate the status quo, and often leads to everyone involved feeling that they have lost more than they have gained.', 'Organizations and communities dedicated to social change will encounter intense disagreements since they are working among people with strongly held beliefs and differing agendas. Many strategic action choices set up conflicts that do more to perpetuate the status quo than to change it: protests, negative media campaigns, lawsuits and regulation battles are time-honored tactics, but their win/lose dynamic tends to polarize opinions around longstanding hostilities. Problems can also arise when attempting to resolve conflicts by relying on a third party to mediate the issues, particularly if the dispute affects multiple divergent and distinct parties. Increasingly, social change actions are developed in settings at which participant decision-makers represent people from around the world. The UN Decade of the Women', 'Starting in 1981 with the publication of the Ury and Fisher book Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement without Giving In, Americans, in particular, learned to imagine solutions to conflicts in which constructive win/win solutions replaced the win/lose model. Ury and Fisher centered on negotiation, and negotiation remains a critical conflict strategy. Their Program on Negotiation at Harvard University Law School, operates as a training and research center with a particular focus on large scale and international conflicts, using a fourfold process: (a) separate the people from the problem; (b) focus on interests, not positions; (c) invent options for mutual gain; and (d) insist on using objective criteria. Central to this process is the ability to recognize whether a proposed agreement is in ones interest; the best alternative to no agreement (BATNA) is a clear understanding of what one will do if no agreement is reached.\r\n\r\nGood communication skills and versatile approaches to problem definition are critical to negotiation and to conflict resolution in general. There is no single posture or style which connects across all cultures and power differences, but many people have found Marshall Rosenbergs training useful for learning to listen effectively and learning to ask clearly. Michelle Le Barons book offers detailed descriptions of good practice for respecting specific cultural factors that will impact any negotiation. Meyer-Knapps analysis of attempts to end wars highlights some additional factors: secrecy can facilitate progress in difficult talks, key leaders must be involved and success often depends on all parties publicly agreeing to end retributive and punitive actions.\r\n\r\nSome conflicts become so embedded in communities that it comes to seem impossible even to discuss them. Two programs illustrate options for opening up the dialogue. The Public Conversations Project has set up forums for private and extended dialogue on abortion in the United States. In the cities where they have worked there is an increasing willingness to reach across the divisions. The Health Bridge Project in the former Yugoslavia achieved a similar effect by setting up clinics and health care recovery projects staffed by professionals from among the hostile Serb, Croat and Bosnian Moslem communities. One particular peacetime derivative of military gaming uses an intensive negotiation/planning protocol in which the stakeholders are explicitly required to negotiate from the perspective of someone other than themselves. \r\n\r\nIntra-organizational disputes can be softened if workers and board-members routinely engage in mediation and facilitation training. Then, should a disagreement arise, they can use the skills on their own behalf. However managers must remember that in US law and culture, once an organizational dispute has arisen, decisions that withstand leglistic challenges are based in well grounded due process. The essentials of due process are timely handling of complaints, neutrality of decision-makers in relation to the dispute, the right of appeal, and an opportunity for all sides to have their point of view heard.\r\n\r\nThis pattern links to Conversational Support Across Boundaries, Citizen Diplomacy, Peaceful Public Demonstrations, Collective Decision-Making, Appreciative Collaboration', 'Conflict can supply a positive impetus to improve the situation, often through negotiations among a variety of opposing parties.

To enable constructive outcomes, negotiate with flexible and compassionate attitudes to opposing parties.

The critique is elaborated in the book The Invisible Computer where Norman argues that 1) the typical computer user the last ten years has been a person with substantial technical expertise, 2) that, due to the fast dissemination of IT services, the typical user in the coming years will be a person without technical expertise, 3) that this will force a fundamental reorientation upon the hardware and software industries, bringing policies of user orientation to the fore.\r\n\r\nDonald Normans analysis has been one of the inspirations for the UsersAward initiative.

At the same time, economic downturns have resulted in diminishing revenue streams for legislative support of higher education, and for-profit as well as international educational institutions offer increasing competition. Academic institutions need to explore the greater opportunities enabled by information technologies for inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional pedagogical and administrative partnerships, in order to revitalize their economic circumstances and re-establish their social relevance.', 'Institutions of higher education play a critical role in the maintenance and advancement of a nation and a culture. They are also often mired in organizational fiefdoms and disciplinary rivalries arising from competition over scarce resources. In turn, opportunities for collaboration are neglected that can advance the education of students and the production of knowledge.\r\n\r\nInformation communication technologies (ICTs) enable faculty and students to interact with others in academies across the nation and around the world. Courses engaging other institutions are being taught through video conferencing and computer-based classrooms; groups activities for students using databases and computer-generated learning objects are revolutionizing large lecture courses in physics and other sciences; researchers are using high performance computing to conduct experiments with international colleagues, at the same time that the extra computing power is leveraged to make available to students at their desktops expensive software through virtual computing labs.\r\n\r\nYet, the rapid and continual development of ICTs leave administrative budgets and personnel at universities struggling to adapt to the constant rate of change. In an age of vastly distributed information networks that can speed data and news around the globe, transparency and accountability are still lacking at traditional universities and other academic institutions. Despite the proliferation of communication devices and channels, faculty, staff, and students too often feel that their needs and views go unheard. Though the complexity of technological advances make it impossible for any one person or group to know all that is needed to make the best implementation plans, for example, ICT investment decisions continue to be made without soliciting other viewpoints.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, academic communication systems such as email and electronic calendaring that have become inextricably interwoven with the day-to-day operations of universities are still being run by multiple units and departments who have developed a sense of distrust and distance from central operations. Educational institutions within the same region and state continue to run routine technology networks individually instead of investigating the significant cost-sharing possible through inter-institutional cooperation, and beliefs in the necessity of institutional branding outweigh the advantages to be found in inter-collegiate curricula and teaching.\r\n\r\nPart of what hinders the realization of more of the collaborative advantages communication networks can offer is an administrative hierarchy that tends to favor corporate-style decision-making in the hopes of producing corporate-style efficiencies, especially in light of the huge costs and rapid change of educational technologies. Yet, Institutions of higher education are built on principles of peer-review of evidence, and communal sharing of knowledge. When the diverse constituencies of the academystudents, faculty, administrators, technical staffare not consulted in top-down decisions, and have no forums in which to engage with each other, those foundational principles are discarded and progressive initiatives can be resisted and even sabotaged.  \r\n\r\nA <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> article titled \"The Role of Colleges in an Era of Mistrust  lays out ten communication principles by which colleges can provide leadership and maintain good faith in the public eye. Reporting on a University of California controversy over the cancellation of an invited speaker by the universitys president without consulting faculty or students, the authors press for a process of communication that includes diverse perspectives: When it is possible to make deliberations open and transparent, colleges must do so. When open-door meetings are not prudent or practical, colleges must be careful to ensure that all the affected parties have a place at the table. Just as important, they must emerge with a clear account not only of what was decided but of how that decision was reached. \r\n\r\nMultiplying communication channels do not necessarily yield greater communication. An inclusive environment that fosters transparency and accountability within all academic sectors can go a long way to eliciting the sense of mission and dedication that characterizes the motives of people in choosing to be part of an educational community. Collaborative learning opportunities, inter-institutional partnerships, and inter-disciplinary scholarship are all developments that are supported by ICTs; creating a climate of openness and engagement across the university enterprise will further their realization.', 'ICTs can facilitate the development of new models of teaching, learning and research that take advantage of inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations in higher education and contribute to the quality of an information society. Such developments can be hindered by the persistence of traditional top-down decision-making that excludes the voices of the wider academic community, and in turn perpetuates a climate of disciplinary rivalry and entrenched silos.

The significant issues and difficulties in the world do not sit still for this orderly strategy: every attempt to define these problems changes them, and so does each step in any attempted solution. Moreover, there are no sound rules to tell when a solution to such a problem is complete, nor any ways to test it off-line.', 'This pattern addresses the mindset one brings to a problem; it may be especially useful for people weighed down by the complexities of the problem they confront, and by the accumulation of previous failed solutions that complex problems tend to accumulate about themselves.', 'The system theorist Horst Rittel coined the term \"wicked problem\" in the early 1970\'s as a corrective to the rationalist approach to planning and design of large-scale systems. The late 1960\'s and early 1970\'s were a heyday for rationalist planning, which can be summarized as the process of fully and explicitly laying out goals, assumptions, and constraints of a problem situation, generating and evaluating alternative solutions, and expecting that the preferred solution will emerge clearly, backed by good reasons.  This approach grew, among other things, from the rise of digital computation, the activist Federal mood of the 1960\'s, and the prospect of bypassing bitter political struggles over such things as urban extensions of the Interstate highway system. Among its applications were low-cost public housing projects, flood control initiatives, moon missions, and Vietnam war strategy. The hope was that objective, data-driven analytical approaches would provide a broadly applicable toolkit for solving large-scale social and environmental problems.\r\n\r\nRittel saw that this hope was doomed, because the problem situations in view could not be defined in agreed, unchanging ways.  These problems are intrinsically ill-defined, and attempts to define them are already actions which reshape the problem and commit the analyst to a course of problem-solving which omits legitimate alternativesand there is no way of escaping this. An extreme example is the Israel-Palestine question: a storm of protest and counter-protest greets every attempt to say what \"the question\" is, much less propose answers. But much milder situations exhibit wickedness. Consider low-cost housing, middle-school math curriculum, or the length of the salmon-fishing season.  Indeed, every building project and most social action, down to the smallest scale, has elements of wickedness. In each case, the interests in play, the intangibility of key values, and the elusiveness of key information mean that a commonly agreed base for problem solving is not objectively available. \r\n\r\nThere are, however, ways forward. The first is to shift the goal of action on significant problems from \"solution\" to \"intervention.\" Instead of seeking just the right moves to eliminate a problem once and for all, one should recognize that any actions occur in an ongoing process, in which further actions will be needed later on. This is not to accept injustice or suffering quietly. If there are ways to eliminate smallpox as a public health problem, and the vaccination campaigns of the 1970\'s proved there were, one should pursue them by all means. But one should realize that smallpox will remain a part of the global health situation in some way. (And so it has, most recently as a potential bioterror weapon.) The intervention mentality recognizes that situations tend to continue, even if their form changes radically.\r\n\r\nThere is a natural fit between the wicked-problem mentality and the DESIGN STANCE (see the pattern of that name). While design has often aimed at closed, once-and-for-all solutions, the multi-factor, iterative, imagination-based process of generating designs is very congenial to what is needed for intervening in wicked problems. Design naturally generates multiple possibilities before settling on one proposal; design naturally engages in a sort of dialogue with the problem situation, in which drawings or other representations of the design idea reveal consequences or relationships which call for changes in the design idea, and vice versa. The precise definition of the problem evolves alongside the ideas for interventions until they converge on action.\r\n\r\nA second way to work with the wickedness of significant problems is to admit the significant actors to the design process.  A typical wicked problem is shaped and reshaped by multiple actors whose influence cannot be closed out. The long maneuvering over the reconstruction of Ground Zero in New York City is a classic example. Both the rationalist tradition in architecture, engineering, public policy, and most other fields and what could be called the now-we-need-a-genius tradition in those same fields have relied on an expert (or sometimes a team of experts) generating a solution in isolation. But the multiple actors in wicked problems can not only obstruct such a solution, they can change the problems definition while the solution is being generated. \r\n\r\nA third step is to design \"loose-fit\" actions. Instead of tailoring an intervention tightly to the understood conditions of a problem, for example choosing sealed windows and central air conditioning for an office building, one should allow for uses, costs, and regulations to change in unforeseen ways, for example drastic escalation in energy costs.  Architecture is one area where one can now see that the rationalist, optimizing mood of the 1970\'s (and after) has saddled businesses and communities with rapidly obsolescing buildings of many kinds, but the need for loose-fit designs or plans occurs in any area with wicked problems.\r\n\r\nA powerful example of successful handling of a wicked problem is passive solar design of buildings. The problem area emerged from the oil crises of the 1970s, as activists strong desires to make use of solar energy as a renewable, free alternative to oil encountered technical difficulties such as low efficiency and daily and seasonal variability, economic challenges such as high first cost and low availability of experienced suppliers, and political/cultural resistances including vested interests, suspicion of unfamiliar technologies, and opposition to ideas perceived as counter-cultural. This mix of difficulties and disparate actors is typically wicked. \r\n\r\nSlowly, over two decades, the problem and goals shifted (e.g. from replacing oil heat to reducing the need for it), experimentation revealed unforeseen directions of development (e.g. building orientation and control of overheating became more critical than total window area), knowledge from traditional practices as well as from engineering measurement began to accumulate, and designers found more and more ways to blend solar performance with standard building functions. A growing consensus on good practice included building code officials and contractors, as well as solar enthusiasts and academics.  Discovery, development, and a degree of controversy continue, but the U.S. is now at a point where passive solar guidelines are widely available and used, at times in such routine guise as to be invisible.', 'Address significant problems with a design mentality that expects them to be wicked, recognizes the kinds of wickedness at work, and understands the design process, from initiation to proposals, as an intervention in a flow of events, not a fixed change in a static scene.

Unfortunately, this is all too often not the case. One group builds a \"solution\" for another group without fully understanding the culture, user needs, extreme cases, and so on. The result is often a technical or social system that creates as many problems as it solves.   This process is often exacerbated when those building the ', 'The forces at work in the situations requiring this pattern include: \r\n\r\n* Gaps in requirements are most cheaply repaired early in development; for this reason, as well as the need to gain acceptance by all parties, all stakeholders must have a say throughout any development or change process. This is an ethical issue as well.  \r\n\r\n* It is logistically difficult to ensure that all stakeholder groups are represented at every meeting.\r\n\r\n* A new social institution or design will be both better in quality and more easily accepted if all relevant parties have input.\r\n\r\nThe idea for this pattern comes from a Native American story transcribed by Paula Underwood entitled, \"Who Speaks for Wolf?\" \r\n\r\nIn brief, the story goes as follows. The tribe had as one of its members a man who took it upon himself to learn all that he could about wolves. He became such an expert that his fellow tribes members called him \"Wolf.\" While Wolf and several other braves were out on a long hunting expedition, it became clear to the tribe that they would have to move to a new location. After various reconnaissance missions, a new site was selected and the tribe moved. \r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, it became clear that a mistake had been made. The new location was in the middle of a wolves breeding ground. The wolves were threatening the children and stealing the drying meat. Now, the tribe was faced with a hard decision. Should they move again? Should they post guards around the clock? Or should they destroy the wolves? Did they even want to be the sort of people who would kill off another species for their own convenience? \r\n\r\nAt last it was decided they would move to a new location. But as was their custom, they also asked themselves, \"What did we learn from this? How can we prevent making such mistakes in the future?\" Someone said, \"Well, if Wolf would have prevented this mistake had he been at our first council meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough,\" they all agreed. Therefore, from now on, whenever we meet to make a decision, we shall ask ourselves, Who speaks for Wolf? to remind us that someone must be capable and delegated to bring to bear the knowledge of any missing stakeholders.\r\n\\\r\nMuch of the failure of \"process re-engineering\" can be attributed to the fact that \"models\" of the \"as is\" process were developed based on some executive\'s notion of how things were done rather than a study of how they were actually performed or asking the people who actually did the work how the work was done. A \"should be\" process was designed to be a more efficient version of the \"as is\" process and then implementation was pushed down on workers. However, since the original \"as is\" model was not based on reality, the \"more efficient\" solution often left out vital elements. \r\n\r\nTechnological and sociological \"imperialism\" provide many additional examples in which the input of all stakeholders was not taken into account. Of course, much of the history of the U.S. government\'s treatment of Native Americans reflects a refusal to truly include all the stakeholders.\r\n\r\nA challenge in applying the \"Who Speaks for Wolf\" pattern is to judge honestly and correctly whether, indeed, someone does have the knowledge and delegation to \"speak for Wolf.\" If such a person is not present, we may do well to put off the design or decision until such a person, or better, \"Wolf\" himself can be present. \r\n\r\nAs a variant of this, a prototype creativity tool has been created. The idea is to have a \"board of directors\" consisting of famous people. When you have a problem to solve, you are supposed to be reminded of, and think about, how various people would approach this problem. Ask yourself, \"What would Einstein have said?\" \"How would Gandhi have approached this problem?\"', 'Provide ways to remind people of stakeholders who are not present.  These methods could be procedural (certain Native Americans always ask, \"Who speaks for Wolf\"), visual (e.g.,diagrams, lists) or auditory (e.g., songs).', NULL, 76, 477, '2006-10-13 15:16:36', '2006-10-29 23:34:45', NULL, NULL, 'IBM Research Hawthorne', NULL, 105, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

From the perspective of the designer, the creative user is unpredictable and random and uses the system in unintended ways that can be detrimental to the overall functionality and robustness of the system. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately this often leads designers to create closed systems with little or no room for user action outside the intended scope.

This technological foundation can be exploited for a creative user-driven design.', 'A successful tool is one that was used to do something undreamed of by its author.  -- S. C. Johnson\r\n\r\nMany observations, both scientific and anecdotal, describe how people use technology in unintended ways. Studies show this happens within organizational settings as well as on the open Web. However, the predominant concept is that the design of a technology should make its use obvious, that it should be user-friendly. Studies have shown that in many cases such systems leave users feeling they are just users (or even customers) of a community system and not participants (Ciborra, 1992; Carroll & Rosson, 1987). \r\n\r\nInstead of viewing unintended use as a problem, it is possible to define it as an opportunity; instead of designing to protect\" the system for creative use, design the system to support and withstand creative use. A system that can handle unintended use will be well equipped to evolve over time and to be updated, and thereby continue to be relevant to users in the community.\r\n\r\nTo be able to design for unintended use, we must study how people as users deal with and approach technology in everyday life, rather than focusing on what they should do when using it in the \"correct\" way. Creative unintended use is and will always be context- and situation-specific, and it will probably not be possible to produce abstractions that could subsequently be used to produce generalized knowledge or concise design principles. \r\n\r\nThe important thing, however, is to find out how people understand, imagine and approach technology. Since Internet technology is designable, community support systems can never be moved from one community to another without adaptation. This means a tool or a specific use that is simply copied will not work the same way under two different circumstances. The tool must be redesigned. The most important knowledge question is, therefore, what kind of knowledge and understanding of the technology is needed to create a solid foundation for these kinds of context-specific redesigns.\r\n\r\nA community is always changing. People develop new needs and wants. The technology for supporting such a community must build on the idea of \"unintended use.\" Unintended use is not a threat to the supporting system; instead unintended use should be understood as a creative driving force. Creative unintended use is a way for users to \"take control\" of the technology, to make it relevant to them. Unintended use is fact of life in a community support system - not a problem.', 'The solution is to intentionally design for creative unintended use. Design principles for creative unintended use can be formulated and used to inform new designs (Stolterman, 2001). Some examples of such principles are: (1) the system must be sufficiently robust to withstand creative use attacks from users, (2) the system must also be \"forgiving,\" which means it has some ability to accept creative use changes without demanding complete safety, (3) a system whose purpose is to elicit creative and radical use, must also present a sufficiently rich, inspiring, and complex environment, and (4) also provide the user with tools for exploring and changing the system itself, (5) the system must also be designed as an open system, i.e., it should be possible for users to expand the scope and breadth of the system without demanding too much structure and administration. These high-level design principles must be further developed and expanded. There is a need for experimental approaches to design for unintended use that are relevant to the situation at hand.', NULL, 15, 836, '2006-08-14 15:00:39', '2006-10-29 22:35:40', NULL, NULL, 'Indiana University', NULL, 30, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

If people do not have access to health how will they be able to rightfully participate in society or of the civic life of their geographical community? Also, if they can not participate, how is that they are to ensure that they will encourage and generate a level of action necessary for developing the access to health they need?\r\n\r\nIn taking a closer look at Amartya Sen\'s and Jean Dreze\'s statement above Jan Garret believes that there are important freedoms that have an instrumental role in making positive [substantial] freedom possible.  \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Political freedoms-- \"the opportunities that people have to determine who should govern and on what principles, and also include the possibility to scrutinize and criticize authorities, to have freedom of political expression and an uncensored press, to enjoy the freedom to choose between different political parties, and so on. They include . . . opportunities of political dialogue, dissent and critique as well as voting rights and participatory selection of legislators and executives.\" </li>\r\n\r\n<li>Economic facilities \"the opportunities that individuals . . . enjoy to utilize economic resources for the purpose of consumption, or production, or exchange.\" The quantity of income as well as how it is distributed is important. Availability and access to finance are also crucial. (Not being able to get credit can be economically devastating.)

Sen refers to \"fixed institutional arrangements such as unemployment benefits and statutory income supplements to the indigent as well as ad hoc (temporary) arrangements such as famine relief or emergency public employment to generate income for destitutes.\" \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs a pattern of development the idea behind <i>Engaging Capabilities</i> can exist as both an approach as well as map for distinct and concrete implementation of development projects and empowerment campaigns whether they be economic, political, health and gender-centric or an integrated collection of all of the above. In regards to the term engaging it is meant to refer to the normative stance that these are fundamental aspects of enabling individuals to lead lives worth living. \r\n\r\nIt is a call to both peoples who are blocked from realizing these capabilities in their day to lives to engage and work to actualize these in their lived experience, similarly it is a call to those social activist, community animators, government and international organizations working to help better their society to pursue not only the economic betterment of peoples, but to address the more holistic reality that makes up a persons lived experience.\r\n\r\nWhile Sen\'s work has placed much emphasis upon the individual, capabilities also naturally points to the civic or community sphere in which groups of participants are able to engage in the process of not only achieving such substantial freedoms but also collectively enjoying and exercising such freedoms.\r\n\r\nWhile much development may in an indirect way encourage the creation or realization of such freedoms; the purpose of <i>engaging</i> these capabilities as a pattern is meant to emphasise awareness of such fundamental freedoms and promote their centraility to a consiusly constructed pattern language that seeks to empower individuals and communities at all levels of society.\r\n\r\nThis means identifying and pursuing direct interaction with local, as well as national-level officials to engage in cooperative and advesarial politics. Ideally bringing about accountability, or achieve steps towards a responsiveness from of government. Affiliation with regional and transnational advocacy groups can assist accessing leverage for marginalized groups. Through engagement and a direction towards freedoms and capabilities peoples can prioritize their political battles that pressure government to pursue policies that actually equate to results in education, health and economic opportunity for those who lack these building blocks.', 'Ultimately, the idea of engaging capabilities is a critical component to almost any pattern language we might wish to construct. Therefore, when constructing a pattern language that is meant to address development in anyway it is necessary to consider the ways in which these projects will utilize the individual as well as collective capabilities of a community (and associated development partners) and how they will be utilized to support and encourage the further realization of these freedoms in peoples lives.', NULL, 721, 408, '2006-10-23 10:23:25', '2006-10-20 09:58:45', NULL, NULL, 'The Public Sphere Project & St. Mary\'s University', NULL, 284, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(295, 285, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'The complexity of the world and multiplicity of perspectives can often stymie peoples attempts to interpret it in ways that make sense and that suggest meaningful action. People often can\'t see the connection between their own thinking and the situation they wish to address. Groups seeking to work together in some broad arena may not identify a common basis for doing so effectively. Sometimes groups can\'t even agree on what they\'d like to accomplish much less how to go about accomplishing it. At other times their efforts may not resonate with the people and organizations they are trying to influence. A similar problem arises when people reactively base their interpretation on some prior and frequently unconscious bias or stereotype. In all of these cases, a poor understanding of strategic frames hinders their ability to make progress.', 'This pattern can be used whenever people and groups need to interpret complex information or develop approaches to communicating with other groups or the public.', 'The concept of frames was initially developed by anthropologist Gregory Bateson (1972) and was further popularized by Erving Goffman (1974). More recently, based on the work of Berkeley linguist George Lakoff, framing has taken a prominent position in progressive political discourse (2004). On a general level, a frame is a story distilled to its basic elements. It could be related to a loving family, a protective father, fairness, fatalism, laziness, freedom, the local sports team, nostalgic for the past, or fear of the unknown &mdash; the possibilities are limitless.\r\n\r\nPeople all over the world are confronted with events and information that they find overwhelming. Without \"frames\" people quite literally wouldn\'t know how to interpret the world. A frame provides a link between information and data and the way that the information and data is <i>interpreted.</i> Seen this way, frames of one sort or another are necessary for every aspect of daily life. Human brains don\'t have the processing power to interpret each new situation \"from scratch.\" Recognizing the ubiquity of frames and the fact that multiple frames can be employed by different people for different reasons to describe the same story or event has lead to a strong interest in frames. \r\n\r\nWhen frames are acknowledged as independent entities, people who are interested in persuasion can begin asking such questions as: What frames do people use? How do frames work? How are they initially constructed or modified? What is the outcome when two or more frames compete?\r\n\r\nWhy does a frame work?  It suggests action and shapes interpretation.  When frames are shared with people or organizations they promote group action and similar interpretations &mdash; while acting to discourage disputes and incompatible interpretation. This discussion leads to types of frames, how they are formed, and how they are reshaped. Strategic frames work in two directions &mdash; they can channel action but can also constrict thought. \r\n\r\nThe framing lens can be turned around and focused on the elites and the powers-that-be as well. Mass media systems are an important subject of this. What frames are generally employed by, for example, local television news stations. A strategic communication terms web sites (cite) cites an example from  Charlotte Ryans <i>Prime Time Activism</i> (1991) of three ways in which a news story of a child in a low-income neighborhood getting bit by a rat can be covered. Who, for example, should be blamed for this &mdash; if anybody? Is the childs mother the culprit or should the apartment manger be held responsible or, even, society at large?\r\n\r\nA strategic frame is a specific type of frame that has been developed as an important element within an overall strategy to encourage people to see things in a certain way. In this sense, the concept is neutral. In fact Susan Niall Bales stated that her approach to Strategic Frame Analysis could be used to promote tobacco use, but added that she probably wouldnt.\r\n\r\nWhen developed collaboratively, a strategic frame can also be a useful tool for groups. When people respond without reflection to an externally imposed strategic frame, they are being exploited. Different frames can be constructed for any given story, message or event. How well those frames resonate with people and what they choose to do with the ideas contained within the frame is of interest to people who are trying to influence other people. Opposing forces will employ different frames with different people to win the particular battle theyre engaged with. This is reflected in the title of a recent New York Times article entitled, Framing Wars (Bai, 2005)Unfortunately many strategic frames that are available to the public serve to reinforce existing stereotypes, thus preventing people from developing effective agendas for the future.', 'It is important to note that frames dont really do the work <i>by themselves.</i> In addition to the important task of understanding frames that influence our actions and behavior, activists  are interested in specific types of frames which have specific functions of interest, such as  frames that help build coalitions; provide useful interpretations; frame transformation (Tarrow)] These frames must <i>connect.</i> In other words, the new frames must not reach too far beyond the capability of people to grasp and shape them.', NULL, 344, 474, '2006-11-20 13:29:15', '2006-11-20 13:19:56', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(296, 286, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Human values and ethical considerations no longer stand apart from the design and development of information and communication systems.  This shift reflects, at least in part, the increasing impact and visibility that information and communication technologies have had on human lives.  Computer viruses have destroyed data on millions of machines.  Large linked medical databases can, and often do, infringe on individuals\' privacy.  The fair outcome of the national elections may hinge in part on the design and management of computerized election ballots.  On and on, the media portray such problems.  In turn, software engineers, designers and developers must now engage not only the technical aspects of their designs but the value and ethical dimensions as well.  Yet how should they do so?  What theories, methods, tools, and techniques might they bring to this challenge?', 'Values are at play in all phases of envisioning, designing, developing, implementing, deploying, appropriating, and on-going re-appropriation and re-invention of computer and information technology.  In all these activities there exists the need for explicit consideration of values, value tensions, and value trade-offs.  The Value Sensitive Design pattern can be used throughout all of these phases.  Moreover, it is expected that Value Sensitive Design will be used in conjunction with other successful methodologies (such as Participatory Design, systematic debugging and testing practices, rapid prototyping) with a variety of practitioners including software engineers, usability engineers, interaction designers, information solution professionals, and concerned direct and indirect stakeholders.', 'That technology itself determines what is to be done by a process of extrapolation and that individuals are powerless to intervene in that determination is precisely the kind of self-fulfilling dream from which we must awakenI don\'t say that systems such as I have mentioned [gigantic computer systems, computer networks, and speech recognition systems] are necessarily evil  only that they may be and, what is most important, that their inevitability cannot be accepted by individuals claiming autonomy, freedom, and dignity.  The individual computer scientist can and must decide.  The determination of what the impact of computers on society is to be is, at least in part, in his handsIt is possible, given courage and insight, for man to deny technology the prerogative to formulate man\'s questions.  It is possible to ask human questions and to find humane answers.  (Joseph Weizenbaum, 1972, p. 614.)\r\n\r\nHeeding to the call of computer scientists like Joseph Weizenbaum and cyberneticist Norbert Wiener before him, the emerging field of Value Sensitive Design seeks to design technology that accounts for human values in a principled and comprehensive manner throughout the design process (Friedman, 1997; Friedman and Kahn, 2003; Friedman, Kahn, and Borning, 2006).  Value Sensitive Design is primarily concerned with values that center on human well-being, human dignity, justice, welfare, and human rights.  This approach is principled in that it maintains that such values have moral standing independent of whether a particular person or group upholds such values (e.g., the belief in and practice of slavery by a certain group does not a priori mean that slavery is a morally acceptable practice).  At the same time, Value Sensitive Design maintains that how such values play out in a particular culture at a particular point in time can vary, sometimes considerably.\r\n\r\nValue Sensitive Design articulates an interactional position for how values become implicated in technological designs.  An interactional position holds that while the features or properties that people design into technologies more readily support certain values and hinder others, the technology\'s actual use depends on the goals of the people interacting with it.  A screwdriver, after all, is well-suited for turning screws, and yet amenable as a poker, pry bar, nail set, cutting device, and tool to dig up weeds.  Moreover, through human interaction, technology itself changes over time.  On occasion, such changes can mean the societal rejection of a technology, or that its acceptance is delayed.  But more often it entails an iterative process whereby technologies are invented and then redesigned based on user interactions, which then are reintroduced to users, further interactions occur, and further redesigns implemented.\r\n\r\nTo date, Value Sensitive Design has been used in a wide range of research and design contexts including: an investigation of bias in computer systems (Friedman and Nissenbaum, in Friedman, 1997), universal access within a communications company (Thomas, in Friedman, 1997), Internet privacy (Ackerman and Cranor, 1999), informed consent for online interactions (Friedman, Howe, & Felten, 2002), ubiquitous sensing of the environment and individual rights (Abowd & Jacobs, 2001), computer simulation to support of democratization of the urban planning process (Borning, Friedman, Davis, & Lin, 2005), social and moral aspects of human-robotic interaction (Kahn, Freier, Friedman, Severson, and Feldman, 2004), privacy in public (Friedman, Kahn, Hagman, Severson, & Gill, 2006), value analyses in reflective design (Senger, Boehner, David, & Kaye, 2005), and the place of designer values in the design process (Flanagan, Howe, & Nissenbaum, 2005).\r\n\r\nMethodologically, at the core of Value Sensitive Design lies an iterative process that integrates conceptual, empirical, and technical investigations.  Conceptual investigations involve philosophically informed analyses of the central constructs and issues under investigation.  Questions include: How are values supported or diminished by particular technological designs?  Who is affected?  How should we engage in trade-offs among competing values in the design, implementation, and use of information systems?  Empirical investigations involve both social-scientific research on the understandings, contexts, and experiences of the people affected by the technological designs as well as the development of relevant laws, policies, and regulations.  Technical investigations involve analyzing current technical mechanisms and designs to assess how well they support particular values, and, conversely, identifying values, and then identifying and/or developing technical mechanisms and designs that can support those values.\r\n\r\nHow then to practice Value Sensitive Design?  Some suggestions follow (see also Friedman, Kahn, & Borning, 2006):\r\n Start With a Value, Technology, or Context of Use.  Any of these three core aspects  a value, technology, or context of use  easily motivates Value Sensitive Design.  Begin with the aspect that is most central to your work and interests. \r\n Identify Direct and Indirect Stakeholders. Systematically identify direct and indirect stakeholders.  Direct stakeholders are those individuals who interact directly with the technology or with the technologys output; indirect stakeholders are those individuals who are also impacted by the system, though they never interact directly with it. \r\n Identify Harms and Benefits for Each Stakeholder Group.  Systematically identify how each category of direct and indirect stakeholder would be positively or negatively affected by the technology under consideration.\r\n Map Harms and Benefits onto Corresponding Values.  At times the mapping between harms and benefits and corresponding values will be one of identity; at other times the mapping will be multifaceted (that is, a single harm might implicate multiple values, such as both security and autonomy).\r\n Conduct a Conceptual Investigation of Key Values.  Develop careful working definitions for each of the key values.  Drawing on the philosophical literature can be helpful here.\r\n Identify Potential Value Conflicts.  For the purposes of design, value conflicts should usually not be conceived of as either/or situations, but as constraints on the design space.  Typical value conflicts include accountability vs. privacy, trust vs. security, environmental sustainability vs. economic development, privacy vs. security, and hierarchical control vs. democratization.\r\n Technical Investigation Heuristic  Value Conflicts.  Technical mechanisms will often adjudicate multiple if not conflicting values, often in the form of design trade-offs.  It may be helpful to make explicit how a design trade-off maps onto a value conflict and differentially affects different groups of stakeholders. \r\n Technical Investigation Heuristic  Unanticipated Consequences and Value Conflicts.  In order to be positioned to respond agiley to unanticipated consequences and value conflicts, when possible, design flexibility into the underlying technical architecture so support post-deployment modifications. \r\n\r\nNote: Much of the material in this pattern was adapted from Friedman and Kahn (2003) and Friedman, Kahn, and Borning (2006).', 'Human values and ethical considerations are fundamentally part of design practice.  Value Sensitive Design offers one viable principled approach to systematically considering human values throughout the design and deployment of information and other technologies.  Through its theory and methods, Value Sensitive Design asks that we extend the traditional criteria (e.g., reliability, correctness) by which we judge the quality of systems to include those of human values.', NULL, 113, 441, '2006-09-20 09:28:43', '2006-09-16 23:01:03', NULL, NULL, 'University of Washington', NULL, 156, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Whether by actively embracing the conventional \"wisdom\" that has created these socially and environmentally precarious  times or by succumbing to the dictates of habit, instinct or necessity, humankind seems to sleepwalking into the future. Indeed it is quite plausible that we are creating the ideal conditions today for unspeakable disasters tomorrow.', 'This pattern can be used in a million situations, especially when people feel strongly that the directions they\'re following aren\'t the directions that they think they ought to be following. Employing this pattern often takes the form of a collaborative envisioning exercise with a variety of stakeholders.', 'Looking at the future with open, imaginative and critical eyes can open up the possibility of &mdash; <i>if not the demand for</i> &mdash; fundamental social change. After all, why would anybody bother to contemplate the future if there were no possibility of change; if every step taken was an echo of some past step. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this pattern is to get people actively engaged envisioning better futures and making plans on how to get there. Through \"rehearsing for the future\" we hope to create a wealth of possible scenarios that could become the positive \"self-fulfilling prophecies\" of tomorrow, rather than the violent and exploitive scenarios that seem to rule today. \r\n\r\nEducational settings are not the only setting for introducing and advancing a rich future-oriented agenda but they may be the best. Unfortunately, however, current educational practices seem to be oblivious to the future. Schools present topics such as mathematics or science with no historical context. History, on the other hand, though based on human events, becomes an \"authoritative\" recounting of past facts while the future is a \"mere abstraction\" (Slaughter & Beare, 1993). And since everything seemingly and inexorably unfolded in an <I>inevitable</I> way, the sequence of human events appears largely unalterable. \r\n\r\nOne failing of a non futures-oriented educational approach is the lack of inquiry into the causes of the world\'s problems (Slaughter & Beare, 1993). Nor is there any effort to develop or consider that could help alleviate these problems. Beyond a cursory look at history, where the impact of people who aren\'t elites is never evident, many people worldwide live in an eternal <i>now</i>, a temporal cocoon which cultivates amnesia of the past and ill preparedness for the future.  Both elites and \"ordinary people\" seem unwilling to acknowledge that they have roles in shaping the future. Forgetting that fact in the face of immense 21st Century challenges strips humankind of its fundamental capacity to consciously make plans (Slaughter & Beare, 1993).\r\n\r\nFuture Design helps surface the internal models of the future that have been ignored, repressed, or deliberately kept from view, and attempts to understand how they play out and how they came to be. At the same time, and somewhat independently, Future Design builds new models that help liberate us from dangerous inertia and help us be more effective in our thinking about and acting on the future.\r\n\r\nThere is an endless variety of exercises, games, workshops, and other activities that we are calling \"Future Design.\" Many of these could be organized and convened in just about any setting. Lori Blewett and Doug Schuler recently used a \"Design a Society\" workshop to organize a large team project in our \"Global Citizenship\" program at The Evergreen State College. Schools, of course, should not be the only place where Future Design can be pursued. Future Design activities are needed that could be done individually (and, hopefully, shared), on the job (government, NGOs, business, etc.), with activists, and as broad-based, possibly phased, longer-termed projects &mdash; with or without government involvement and support. \r\n\r\nThe current project, Open Space Seattle 2100 to develop a \"comprehensive open space network vision for Seattle\'s next 100 years\" contains elements (including the need for participants and resources &mdash; even if it\'s just time) that could be considered typical of Future Design activities.  Since the Seattle plan is ambitious it requires broad support and ample resources. The University of Washington and the City of Seattle are key players as are a variety of environmental, civic, neighborhood, professional and other groups. Many of the Future Design projects that have civic goals are participatory and inclusive. At the same time that the community is developing a collective vision, the organizers also aim \"To catalyze a long-term advocacy coalition and planning process for Seattle\'s integrated open space.\"\r\n\r\nThe Seattle project consciously invokes the visionary park and landscape work of the Olmstead brothers in the early 1990\'s that contributed to Seattle\'s livability. The timeline for this project which is longer than standard planning horizons, frees participants from a variety of constraints on their thinking. By encouraging people to think beyond what\'s considerable immediately do-able people are more likely to be creative. On the other hand, if the timeframe is too far in the future participants are likely to feel detached from the enterprise. The Seattle project gets around this by including tasks for the short-term as well as visions  for the long-term. \r\n\r\nIn order to strike a balance between the real and the imagined, designers of Future Design projects must provide a structure for less-structured activities to take place within. The projects must provide prompts &mdash; scenarios, instructions, props, etc. &mdash; that encourage people to imagine a future without forcing them down certain paths. Since people can\'t simply be instructed to \"be creative,\" these \"prompts\" are used to promote futures thinking among the participants. This pattern can be used in many settings, but research has shown that Future Design needs a supportive atmosphere, and, as Open Space Technology literature suggests, participants need to participate with passion, commitment and an open-mind.  A broad spectrum of community groups needs to be represented, or at least recognised, or the outcome can reaffirm prejudices and help perpetuate old conflicts. \r\n\r\nFuture Design processes often provide a variety of participatory opportunities. The 7-10 person teams that addressed open space issues in one of the neighborhoods outlined on the Seattle Charrette Map (see image at end of this pattern) are key to the effort but organizers have organized a lecture series and a blog (http://open2100.blogspot.com) to encourage alternative ways to participate. \r\n\r\nMassive challenges await this vain undertaking at every turn. How effective is Future Design? How do games and other Future Design approaches translate into <i>action</i> How do future designers from one group build on the results of others?  Interestingly a project whose recommendations aren\'t  implemented can still be a success.  Margaret Keck describes the \"Solucao Integrada\" (Integrated Solution), a plan for sewage treatment and environmental restoration in Brazil, which, although shelved by the government, lived on in the public\'s eye as an example of sensible large-scale solution in the face of other ill-conceived projects. \"Success\" must be judged in a variety of ways and this includes inclusivity and richness of the Future Design process, its immediate impacts and its indirect contributions to the overall imagination and civic culture of a community. \r\n\r\nFinally, as John Perry Barlow\'s email tagline reminds us: \"Man plans, God laughs.\" Human history is full of twists, enlightened and macabre, tragic and heroic.

Schools with static and immutable assumptions and values are unlikely to meet society\'s changing needs. This is particularly unfortunate at a time when the need for public problem-solving is the most acute. If schools aren\'t innovative and if people don\'t seriously think about how education can play new roles in new ways, it\'s unlikely that the society will be innovative in cultural, technical, scientific, or civic thought or action. Schools also tend to assist privileged subsets of society. Typically, older people can\'t attend school, nor can poor people, working people, or rural people. Many colleges and universities (at least in the US) are more becoming commercially-oriented, thus promoting economic aggrandizement of individuals and corporations while ignoring the common good.', 'Any situation where education or some type of \"schooling\" is necessary. This pattern has almost universal coverage because learning is a universal phenomenon. Humans are built for learning!', 'For this pattern we can define an experimental school as a school that broadly attempts to accomplish certain aims (such as social and environmental amelioration) while adopting experimentation as an abiding and guiding orientation. This implies that the school is not perfect and it affirms that the school will at least try to adapt to changing societal circumstances and needs (while maintaining its values). Moreover, it will work towards its goals through a thoughtful experimentation that involves careful and ongoing evaluation of the approaches that the school is trying. \r\n\r\nSchool according to John Dewey should be an experiment in collective action and it should break down walls between academia and practical work. Although this pattern is quite broad (and actually contains several patterns in their own right), several themes or trajectories stand out that support Dewey\'s contentions whether the student is ten years old or eighty, or whether the student is classically educated or illiterate. Adopting an \"experimental\" orientation reflects a belief in meliorism &mdash; that things <i>can</i> improve through directed effort &mdash; and an acknowledgement that nothing is perfect; the need for adjustment is an unavoidable and normal fact of life. Beyond that, the general orientation is compassionate engagement and integration with the world. In a general but non-dogmatic way, an Experimental School would be concerned with the common good, it would stress solidarity and activism. It would be much more <i>permeable</i> &mdash; the boundaries between the institution, between teacher and student, between theory and practice and between the academic disciplines themselves and the disciplines and the other systems of knowing that people have devised, would all be less distinct and more forgiving. Additionally there would be more variety as to when and where the educational setting would be and who was eligible to take part. Costs would be as low as possible to encourage everybody to attend. Education is not just for some small segment of the population who are destined for power, prestige and money. \r\n\r\nThe following table, admittedly over-generalized, highlights some of the ways in which a \"modern\" university can be contrasted with an Experimental School. \r\n<center><table width=\"80%\"  border bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"><tr><th width=\"28%\">&nbsp;</th><th width=\"36%\">University Model</th><th width=\"36%\">Experimental School</th></tr><tr><td>Site</td><td>Centralized, stationary, and formal</td><td>Various locations, movable, informal</td></tr><tr><td>Student body</td><td>Elite, all same age</td><td>Open to anybody, life-long learning; mixed classes</td></tr><tr><td>Assessment</td><td>Defined by faculty, etc. consists of tests, grades</td><td>Self assessed by student as well as by faculty member through oral and written narrative evaluation.</td></tr><tr><td>Curriculum</td><td>University-directed, discipline-based, disciplines kept separate</td><td>Student-directed, inquiry-based, discipline boundaries blurred and broached</td></tr><tr><td>Role of teacher / role of student </td><td>Authoritative / receptive (\"empty vessel\")</td><td>Teachers and students are both co-learners</td></tr><tr><td>Costs</td><td>Expensive for middle and lower income people</td><td>Free</td></tr><tr><td>Instruction mode</td> <td>Lecture</td> <td>Peripatetic, seminar, group work</td></tr> <tr><td>Credential granting</td><td>Often the most important reason for attending</td><td>Doesn\'t necessarily grant credentials.

Idiocy was defined by the ancient Greeks to mean the state of being \"concerned myopically with private things and unmindful of common things.\" Idiots are like \"rudderless ships\" that are not grounded in either the local or the global community. Unable to see beyond their parochial interests, they\'re likely to do damage to themselves and to the communities in which they live. In his consideration of how idiots come about their idiocy, Parker asks whether our public \"schools marshal their human and material resources to produce idiots or citizens? Does the school curriculum, both by commission and omission, cultivate private vices or public virtues?\"\r\n\r\nParker proposes several important remedies: \"First, increase the variety and frequency of interaction among students who are culturally, linguistically, and racially different from one another. Second, orchestrate these contacts so that competent public talkdeliberation about common problemsis fostered. In schools, this is talk about two kinds of problems: social and academic. Social problems arise inevitably from the friction of interaction itself (Deweys problems of living together), and academic problems are at the core of each subject area. Third, clarify the distinction between deliberation and blather and between open (inclusive) and closed (exclusive) deliberation. In other words, expect, teach, and model competent, inclusive deliberation.\"\r\n\r\nIt\'s also important for students to take some responsibility (and interest) in their own education early. People with these attitudes and capabilities can undertake their own ongoing education (even in the absence of schools and teachers) and work with others to get them involved. One of the best ways to do this and to help install the sense that the student is part of the process is self-assessment of learning at all levels. \r\n\r\nIf the point of evaluating students\' work were only to rank them, or to give faculty a lever for encouraging their efforts, or even to describe the strengths and weaknesses of what they had produced, then it would seem clear that teachers should do it by themselves. The deepest reasons, however, for asking students to formally assess their own work pertain to the students\' development over the long run. For one thing, the student may have learned some things which are relevant to learning which the teachers don\'t know about. If students have learned how to write a paper without agonizing over the first paragraph for hours, or pay a new kind of attention to the clouds when they go for a walk, or think about the late Roman Republic when they read the papers, these changes may say more about their education in literature or physics or history than their essays or exams do, yet be invisible to the teachers. \r\n\r\nThe practice of self-assessment is a central way for students to acquire the reflective habits of mind which are essential to their ongoing capacities to do good work, and to progressively improve their work over time. Growth in intelligence, or thinking, is precisely growth in the capacity for ongoing reflective self-assessment. This point is the center of Dewey\'s analysis of the difference between mere activity and educational experience in Democracy and Education (1916): \"Thinkingis the intentional endeavor to discover specific connections between something which we do and the consequences which result, so that the two become continuous.\"\r\n\r\nBut formal education is considered complete at a certain age. Does this mean that people who have missed this one chance or who are otherwise interested in additional education are simply out of luck? Popular education, developed in the 1960s and 70s by the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire helps to answer that question positively. Popular education is a non-traditional method of education that strives for the empowerment of adults through democratically structured cooperative study and action. It\'s carried out within a political vision that sees women and men at the community and grassroots level as the primary agents for social change. It aims to enable ordinary people to define their own struggles and critically examine and learn from the lessons of past struggles and from concrete everyday situations in the present. It is a deeply democratic process, equipping communities to name and create their vision of the future for which they struggle.\r\n\r\nThe popular education process begins by critically reflecting on, sharing, and articulating with a group or community what is known from lived experience. It continues with analysis and critical reflection upon reality aimed at enabling people to discover solutions to their own problems and set in motion concrete actions for the transformation of that reality. In Freires model, the teacher becomes a facilitator, the traditional class becomes a cultural circle, the emphasis shifts from lecture to problem-posing strategies, and the content, previously removed from the learners experience, becomes relevant to the group.\r\n\r\nPopular education has always had an intimate connection to organizing for social change. In the early 1960s, Freire, began his work in this area by using the principles of dialogue and critical consciousness-raisingfundamental to popular educationto teach literacy to peasants struggling for land reform in Brazil. Freire argued that action was the source of knowledge, not the reverse, and that education, to be transformative, involved a process of dialogue based on action and reflection on action.\r\n\r\nAlthough starting a new &mdash; or supporting an existing &mdash; Experimental School might be the best use of this pattern, the concepts of an Experimental School can be useful to anybody who is establishing new programs in a traditional school or involved in virtually any way in the education of themselves or anybody they know. The key concepts are respect for learning, reflection, and a faith in the importance of reasoning and, especially, reasoning together.', 'Integrate the ideas from this pattern into educational settings that exist or can exist.

(299, 289, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'The people who are the most affected by the digital divide typically need to access information from nonprofit organizations. However, most NPO\'s do not have the time, personnel, and/or skills to create and maintain web sites. Thus, the service-oriented information needed the most by lower income community members is often not online. In addition, many lower-income community members lack the skills necessary to effectively use web sites. Finally, data supporting the local impact of the digital divide is often insufficient or even non-existent.', 'This problem has a unique solution in regions surrounding college campuses with service-learning programs.', 'The groups most likely to be impacted negatively by the digital divide are paradoxically the groups that need access to basic service-related information the most. Quite often, members of these groups also lack the skills needed to use the Internet effectively. In addition, nonprofit organizations (NPO\'s) often have the information needed by these disadvantaged groups, but also paradoxically are unable to make this information available online. The needs of both groups are in conflict, and create a context in which it is extremely difficult for either groups needs to be met.\r\n\r\nDigital Divide Impacted Groups Needs:\r\n* easily accessible and up-to-date information\r\n* interaction with service providers\r\n* appealing design\r\n* intuitive navigation systems\r\n* training\r\n\r\nNPO\'s Needs/Lacks:\r\n* personnel to put information online while still meeting clients\' needs\r\n* additional time to create and maintain web pages\r\n* knowledge and skill to create effective web sites\r\n* funds to pay for server space or a webmaster\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is for the NPO\'s to rely on a volunteer from the community to create and maintain a website. However, relying on volunteer labor for web sites is risky, due to the turnover rate and varying skill levels of volunteers. What is needed is a pool of skilled, but cost-free, assistance.\r\n\r\nOne place to find this pool is on college campuses with service-learning programs. Service-learning is a pedagogical method designed to link course content with external experiences. Students <i>learn</i> the course-related materials through traditional learning in the classroom and through practical projects in and with the community, as well as about the reality and significance of the social issues faced by the community; while simultaneously providing a <i>service</i> to the community by meeting specific needs of the agencies or the populations with which they work.\r\n\r\nA service-learning class intentionally links the content of the course to a relevant NPO\'s goals. Students benefit from the chance to apply their skills to a real problem, and to learn about the needs of the community; while the NPO\'s benefit from the chance to have some of their goals and needs met, and to influence the next generation of leaders. In the long run, research has shown that students who take part in service-learning courses feel a greater sense of connection to their local communities, as well as an understanding of their interdependence with their neighbors. Connection and interdependence are building blocks of responsibility, and responsible citizens are in turn the building blocks of strong communities.\r\n\r\nThe initiative for a service-learning course can come from a number of different places. Individual professors can choose to use this pedagogical method in their courses, universities may require service-learning in certain classes, or community agencies may propose projects that fit with the learning objectives of a class. Regardless of the source, effective service-learning requires collaboration between the members of the community and the academic institution: it should be done WITH the community, not ON the community. The goals and needs of the community must be combined with the goals and needs of the course. This process of collaboration is often facilitated by offices on the campus specifically designated to assist with service-learning.\r\n\r\nThe service can take one of three forms.\r\n1) Direct service: students work with the community members served by local agencies. In the case of the digital divide, students in a wide range of courses could train local community members to access and evaluate online information. This training could be done at the local library, senior centers, retirement homes, elementary schools, and any other locations with the necessary facilities (connected computers).\r\n2) Indirect service: students work with the local community agencies to provide them with some needed assistance, which indirectly benefits their clients. In the case of the digital divide, students in web design courses can be required to create and/or update web sites for local NPO\'s, or run workshops training agencies representatives to maintain their own sites. \r\n3) Community-based research: students (with faculty support) conduct research for and with a local community agency. In the case of the digital divide, people trying to change the existing systems sometimes lack the hard evidence needed to prove that a problem exists. Students in a wide range of research-methods courses could conduct survey research into the impact of the digital divide at the local level. \r\n\r\nBut most importantly, the impact of a service-learning course goes beyond the immediate project: it results in changed lives. This is because a critical component of any service-learning course is reflection. Research shows that we don\'t really learning anything from experience (we often make the same mistakes repeatedly); we learn from thinking about our experiences. Students in service-learning courses are required to reflect on their experience in rigorous, thoughtful, and evaluated ways. This process drives the learning home, increasing the integration of knowledge they have gained in the present course with the way they live their lives in the future. For example, to create web sites, students must understand the agency, which means they must research the role that the NPO plays in the community, the populations that it serves, and the social issues that underlie its mission. This research helps students understand how critical access to the right information is for everyone, and how information is always related to power. Putting students in contact with members of the local community can also help dispel stereotypes. Students\' easy access to computers often leads them to mistakenly believe that the digital divide is just a \"Mercedes divide.\" Requiring students to work with underfunded and understaffed non-profit agencies, who are themselves working with disadvantaged groups, can open their eyes to the very real informational needs in the communities in which they live.', 'Service-learning provides a way to use the resources of a college or university to meet  real community needs, such as designing web sites for NPO\'s or training community members to effectively access and evaluate information online. Students can create valuable resources for the community while simultaneously becoming more aware of the social issues in that community. This ensures that once people are able to cross the digital divide, they will find the local information that they need, and not just more places to shop. This also creates the possibility for the next generation of leaders to have a better understanding of the information needs of their local community.', NULL, 91, 805, '2006-09-20 09:27:16', '2006-09-29 10:04:14', NULL, NULL, 'Appalachian State University', NULL, 142, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Citizens need information about the political, economic, and cultural systems that structure their lives in order to act on them effectively. However, traditional news institutions have had major failures in their ability to adequately cover new', 'Distributed information on the web opens new possibilities for citizen information. Some say that we at the ', 'The magnitude and interest in Citizen Journalism is quite new, although forms of it have existed through much of modern history. The pamphleteers of the American Revolution were, in their way, citizen journalists. Many of the newspapers that cropped up in the 19th Century were started by non-professionals, who saw a need in local communities and began publishing a mix of news, advertising, and gossip. Newspapers were professionalized in the 19th Century, leading to a relatively independent corps of journalists oriented to fact-based \"objective reporting. But professionalization also discounted the underlying truth claims on one side or another and led to a decline of independent judgment and, sometimes, support for the status quo. \r\n\r\nBeginning in the 90s, public or civic journalism constituted a major reaction to this state of affairs. The movement grew from the principle that while news organizations could and should remain independent in judging particular disputes and advancing particular solutions to problems, they ought not to remain neutral on democracy and civic life itself. About of a fifth of all American newspapers and some television stations experimented with civic journalism from the early 90s to the early 2000s, but other pressures subverted it. \r\n\r\nBy the mid-1990s, the web began to offer a different alternative. Blogging offered new networks of opinion writing, as well as criticism of traditional media outlets. Some considered it journalism, others editorializing or soapboxing. But, what was clear was that the new writing could carve out its own space of attention on the web (although it remained dependent on the reporting of the mainstream media).\r\nCitizen journalism as a distinct movement emerged in early 2000s. Journalists like Dan Gilmor, left the San Jose Mercury News to start Bayosphere, an independent journalism blog. . At the same time, political blogs grew rapidly in number and influence on both left and right sides of the political spectrum.  \r\n\r\nThe emerging practices of citizen journalism run the gamut from new forms of audience participation in traditional media to citizen expression in the blogosphere In terms of content they alternate fact-oriented reporting of locally based participants in the context of a global network, to self-expression of opinion. What defines citizen journalism, then, is not specific content, a given business model or a form of reporting, but rather a networked structure of storytelling that is based on the following premises: a) openness of information; b) horizontal linkage structures rather than vertical flows of information; c) blurring lines between content production and consumption; d) diffused accountability based on reputation and meaning, rather than on structural system hierarchies.\r\n\r\nOne of the best examples of a mainstream media institution practicing citizen journalism is the Spokane Spokesman Review (www.spokesmanreview.com/) which systematically incorporates the views of Spokanes citizens in every aspect of its reporting, from hard news to sports. The Review has even put its morning news meeting on the web.\r\n\r\nAnother strand of citizen journalism is a hybrid, in which professional and citizens interact in the production process. The exemplar in this realm is Ohmy News (www.ohmynews.com) from South Korea whose motto is Every Citizen is a Reporter. Ohmy News has a paid editing and reporting staff that works on 200 plus daily submissions from citizens. More than 40,000 citizens overall have contributed to the site. U.S. Sites like the Twin Cities Daily Planet (www.tcdailyplanet.net) and the Voice of San Diego (www.voiceofsandiego.org) are seeking to replicate its success, and Ohmy News is investing in its International site. Recently, Jay Rosen in PressThink (http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/) has proposed New Assignment, a hybrid model in which citizens will submit issues and topics they want to see reported on, and professional editors will pursue the story along with citizen journalists. \r\n\r\nThe Madison Commons project in Wisconsin has developed another type of hybrid model. The Commons project trains citizens to do neighborhood reporting and gathers reporting from mainstream media aggregates it on a local web site. (www.madisoncommons.org). Another good example of academic/citizen partnerships is represented by Mymissourian (www.mymissourian.com), in which journalism students serve as editors for citizen journalists.\r\n\r\nFinally, the blogosphere emerges as a massive example of citizen journalism as part of a large conversation that either makes or comments on the news. Of course blogs, their content, their significance and recognition vary widely, from general blogs of professional journalists like Gilmores to pundits on the left and right, to community level aggregators to more personal expressions (www.baristanet.com/). \r\n\r\nCitizen journalism allows anyone who wants to contribute to public debate as an active participant. There are a number of relevant motives: the intrinsic enjoyment of interviewing, reporting and writing. The civic rewards of contributing informed knowledge to a larger public discussion and debate. And the reward of building an alternative institution, whether local news alternative or worldwide public.\r\n\r\nFirst, citizen journalism offers the ability to collaborate to make many small contributions to what is essentially an ongoing conversation among many people, most of whom do not know each other than through the common project. Second, the so-called \"wisdom of crowds,\" holds that many people know more than a few, that even experts only have limited knowledge, and that a broad open domain with many contributors will produce useful and valid knowledge.\r\n\r\nThird, and closely related to these, is the idea of \"the people formerly known as the audience.\" (Rosen and Gilmore). This is to say that the audience for news media (media in general) is no longer passive. Rather it is an active group that will respond in a continuum to the news, ranging from simple active reading, linking and sending stories to friends via email and lists, and commenting on stories, to contributing factual knowledge that can flesh out or correct a story, to actual writing as citizen journalists. Across all these levels of activity citizens become more engaged with their communities. \r\n\r\nAn active and engaged citizenry can expand the range of topics discussed, and improve the quality and extent of information about any given issue, by opening it up to anyone involved. Citizen journalism creates the possibility for civic action to be deliberative instead of hierarchical. By participating directly in the production and dissemination of journalism citizens help, even in small ways, to set the news agenda.\r\n\r\nAlternatives to citizen journalism such as face to face community level deliberation exercises and electronic dialogues are both important and complimentary to citizen journalism, but they lack the fact-based component which is critical to democracy and that should not be solely in the hands of traditional media. \r\n\r\nFor citizens to use this pattern, there are a number of things they can do. They can go to websites like www.j-lab.org to find out how to begin doing citizen journalism themselves, and have access to many tools and examples. The best overall resource for thinking about citizen journalism is Press Think  (www.pressthink.org) which also links many layers of citizen journalists, mostly in the U.S. Those interested in the international movement can go to Ohmy News  International (http://english.ohmynews.com) or Wikinews (www.wikinews.org). There are also web resources such as the News University that where originally conceived to enhance the training of journalists, but that can also improve the journalistic skills of citizens (www.newsu.org). \r\n\r\nThere are three main challenges to citizen journalism: sustainability, inclusion and traditional journalism. Probably the biggest challenge to doing citizen journalism is sustaining a distributed enterprise that requires time, attention, and skill, from both producers and contributors/readers. A second challenge is to avoid ending up in many small communities of group monologue rather than in a broader community dialogue. And finally, citizen journalism may accelerate the erosion of traditional journalism without replacing it with a new model powerful enough to center attention on core social problems, in a society that is already highly distracted. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, is appears that a pattern that brings together the  networked discussion of citizens  in the blogosphere with fact oriented reporting will be a more fitting model to build a vibrant public sphere than the centralized and hierarchical model of the printed media and mass television that we have now (Maher, 2005). Benkler (2006) has made a powerful argument that the baseline for our evaluation should be the mass media model that has, in many ways, failed to report on the most critical issues of our day, not an idealized model of citizen journalism. Further, for the foreseeable future, they will continue to complement each other, willingly or not.', 'Build new models of citizen journalism, nationally, internationally, and locally to create new forms of reporting and public accountability. In local communities, build information commons to support the active learning and participation of citizens in changing the traditional media ecologies to ones that blend the best of citizen and traditional media. For individuals, learn new skills of reporting via the web, and become an active reader, commenter, and contributor.\r\n\r\nThe citizen journalism pattern is already being realized world-wide. Its  beauty is that is only takes a sufficient number of citizens with access to technology and an interest in some story. Citizen journalism is growing daily as the increasing number of projects worldwide and the expanding blogosphere attest. Whether it will continue to grow will depend upon the solutions posed by these projects to the challenges of sustainability and inclusion. Although it is early to asses the impact of citizen journalism it would appear that in Korea it has served to open the political spectrum and in the United States to redefine the news agenda. It remains to be seen, whether, and how, citizen journalism can develop in non- democratic countries. At least in theory it could represent an important pathway in the development of a networked civil society that brings about democratization change.', NULL, 804, 856, '2006-10-16 20:14:48', '2006-10-27 22:56:51', 'University of Wisconsin', NULL, 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', NULL, 316, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(301, 291, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Supporting group interaction around a shared document is challenging for designers of two-dimensional interfaces and asynchronous, text-based groupware. The need to deliberate (collaborate, make decisions, or make comments) around documents appears to be one of the main reasons that groups that could otherwise interact virtually and asynchronously using the Internet choose to meet synchronously, either in person or online, often in a richer environment than text only (e.g., including audio, video, or a three-dimensional environment). When some or all stakeholders are unable to participate in synchronous meetings, distributed asynchronous interaction offers many advantages to groups deliberating about documents: more time for reflection, revision, and information seeking (cf. Holland and Stornetta 1992); the ability to accommodate people\'s conflicting schedules; flexible interaction modes through conversion of text to and from speech (e.g., for disabled or less literate users); the easier access, storage, and search afforded by digital archives; and the empowerment of those who are at a disadvantage when participation involves speaking in a live group (Price and Cappela 2002). But mapping in-person meetings onto an asynchronous interaction through distributed two-dimensional text displays entails several types of lost richness, including nonverbal grounding cues (Clark and Brennan 1991), spatial depth, the natural use of separate perceptual modalities for document (visual) and discussion (auditory), and the use of a shared temporal progression to guide attention.', 'In our usage, a <i>document</i> can be in any format, including images, audio, and video, but our primary focus here is on digital documents in which most of the information is in text. Discussion that takes place around a document consists of comments that pertain to either the document as a whole or some part of it. The document may be fixed or evolving as the discussion around it proceeds, but the document assumes an elevated status over the comments made about it because, for example, it has been chosen for careful discussion, its final version will have governing consequences, or it will represent the outcome of a collaboration. In the latter cases, the group must somehow reach a decision relating to the document (e.g., whether to adopt it).  This pattern focuses on interfaces for visually abled users. Adapting the analysis presented here for visually impaired users might be possible, but our feeling is that that will require quite a different approach, one we hope to investigate in the future.', 'The projection of a three-dimensional, multimodality, co-located, synchronous deliberation experience (i.e., communicating face-to-face in a non-virtual place) onto a two-dimensional, primarily visual, distributed asynchronous interaction requires essential aspects of face-to-face deliberation to be remapped onto a screen interface. The needed mappings can be judged according to two broad goals:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Visible relationships. Relationships between comments and the texts they reference, between different comments, and between group members and the document and discussion should be as visible as possible.</li>\r\n<li>Distinguishable boundaries. Separations between contextually related and unrelated text and comments and between individual authors of documents and comments should be as distinguishable as possible.</li> </ul>\r\n\r\nWe first consider visible relationships. Exhibiting relationships between the components of document-centered deliberation (document, comments, and participants) implies a number of refinements of this goal. First, the document text that is the target of deliberation should be covisible (displayed simultaneously) with comments around it, and the identities of comment authors and document text, when relevant, should also be covisible with their output. Second, the referencing relationship between a comment and its target text should be visible, that is, the interface should incorporate ostensive pointing (meaning that a pointing relationship is displayed on the screen rather than being enacted through a peripheral device) and in-text placement of comments. Third, response relationships between comments should be visible through threading. And fourth, the reactions of deliberation participants should be visible through polling and decision features. \r\n  \r\nThe other goal is distinguishable boundaries. Visible relationships can be inadequate, as anyone would know who has used a map with ambiguous place labelings. The interface should also mark boundaries between text that is and is not the reference target of a comment, for example, though text highlighting. Text authored by different people at different times should be distinguishable through textual boundaries. The topic of a text should be able to be viewed separately from its main body through headers. And obsolete comments (those made on a previous version) should be recognizable through pertinence markers which indicate which versions a comment pertains to, as well as those to which it does not apply, for example, because it has been addressed in the revision process. \r\n\r\nThe Deme environment for online deliberation is a tool for document-centered discussion, polling, and decision making that incorporates all of the elements derived above in a dynamically updating (no-page-reload) interface. The introductory image above shows the most recent design of the meeting area viewer in Deme. The shaded-in header of a comment in the discussion view pane on the right points to a shaded-in comment reference in the text of a document shown in the item view pane on the left. Deme provides covisibility between document and comments through an optional split-screen view. In-text comment references are transiently pointed to (the dotted-line arrow goes away as soon as the user scrolls) when clicked on, and comments are displayed in the context of hierarchical threads. Members can vote on documents under a variety of decision rules. Boundaries are provided through highlighting, text boundaries, headers, and a versioning system that remembers when comments become obsolete and marks them as such.

When this antagonism becomes institutionalized, through policy, public attitude, or propaganda, warfare or other violence becomes a natural consequence. The unique powers of individual people to help overcome these rifts by calming tempers, building ties, promoting reason and dialogue, or healing wounds is rarely acknowledged or promoted. Sometimes, as a matter of fact, the efforts of the rare person who strives to develop personal connections with \"the enemy\" is demonized by people on both \"sides.\"', 'This pattern can be applied whenever a country\'s stance towards another country is antithetical to the needs and values of civil society. This can happen before, during, or after a war or other period of hostility and mistrust.', 'The use of the concept of \"citizen diplomacy\" was apparently first applied when <a href=\"http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC09/CitDip.htm\">US citizens journeyed to the former Soviet Union</a> in the 1980s and met with activists, educators, scientists, health professionals and \"ordinary\" citizens. These citizens &mdash; and their Soviet counterparts &mdash; did not want to accept the \"inevitability\"of war, either hot or cold, and sought to find common ground on which to build a more peaceful future for everybody. Citizen diplomacy offers the promise of (world?) peace by building on actual, hopeful and optimistic face-to-face encounters by citizens of the designated enemy states.\r\n\r\nThe idea for this pattern, like others in the language, arose in a specific historical context, namely in the late 1980\'s during the protracted \"cold war\" between the Warsaw Pact nations (most notably the Soviet Union) and the NATO countries (most notably the USA). Although the information reported here is based on experiences from that time, it is expected that this pattern will be applicable in a great variety of situations in which two (or more) states or other large groups are enemies. Several antagonistic dyads come to mind &mdash; India and Pakistan; Israel and the Arab States; the US and Cuba or Venezuela &mdash; and each situation contains its own unique opportunities and risks. \r\n\r\nPeople who engage in projects along these lines certainly fit Richard Falk\'s description of a \"citizen pilgrim\" who is willing to go on a quixotic journey for a seemingly improbable goal. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, especially in a pre-Internet era, many of the collaborative efforts (described in Citizen Diplomacy: Progress Report 1989: USSR) were related to the use of information and communication. Some of the projects include __________\r\n\r\nThe collaborative projects themselves are subject to enormous challenges. Simply meeting with people from \"the other side\" presents great obstacles (including financial costs, legal restrictions on travel to &mdash; and within &mdash; the other country, privacy of communications, and access to people). Furthermore, any collaborative project, unless it is done clandestinely, will exist \"at the pleasure\" of the powers-that-be. In fact, one of the ultimate risks inherent in a project like this is that individuals being used or manipulated by the powers-that-be (such as the media, state power, think-tanks, political parties, or religious institutions)  in ways that simply overwhelm the hopes and energy of the citizen-diplomat.  \r\n\r\nSince the unraveling of the Soviet Union in the early 1990\'s, the global situation as noted above has changed considerably. The rough parity of power (exemplified to some degree by the size of their nuclear weapon stockpiles) between the Warsaw Pact countries and the NATO countries and the promise of \"Mutually Assured Destruction\" (or MAD) helped prevent direct confrontation and led to numerous \"proxy conflicts\" which were sponsored in part by the combatant\'s respective superpower allies. The military parity has now largely dissolved and the arms race between the US and the USSR has given way to a one-sided arms race where the US appears now to be competing with the rest of the world; its military expenditures (including several new nuclear weapons) now amounts to nearly half of the world\'s military expenditures. \r\n\r\nFinally it must be said that it\'s not obvious that collaborative projects like these will yield any long-lasting benefits. An interesting example is that when the US media entered the Soviet Union after Glasnost, they followed the routes that the citizen diplomats has established. While it\'s true that relations were finally normalized between the two countries, the citizen-diplomat may be well-advised that setbacks may outnumber the  gains.', 'Establish contacts and develop collaborative projects between individual citizens and groups in countries or regions where relations are severely strained or non-existent.', NULL, 356, 583, '2006-11-20 13:29:49', '2006-11-02 22:17:36', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

There are also organizations and other institutions that violate the public trust or who otherwise wield illegitimate power. Unfortunately these two types often overlap. Some wield enormous power while some are impotent and irrelevant. At any rate, both types must be monitored closely &mdash; persistently and non-superficially &mdash; to encourage them to exert their powers appropriately. Moreover, both of these groups (and, indeed, all of us) are faced with millions (basically <i>uncountable</i>) of problems (and problems in the making) within the environment that are not well understood within a useful framework. The institutions that civil society establishes are often too diffuse or too narrow to face these problems effectively, while many seem to be \"reinventing the wheel.\" Institutions of government and business can be too powerful or politically beholden to perform their duties responsibly; they can also be conceptually or administratively misaligned with their mission for many reasons.', 'There are many sets of problems / situations / contexts that can be addressed with the same pattern. \"Institutions\" in the sense of people who are organized around certain goals in a persistent way are ubiquitous.', 'The world of mirrors &mdash; and, hence, any discussion of them in a metaphorical way &mdash; leads to reflections and reflections of reflections and reflections of reflections of reflections and so on. <i>So be it. </i> \r\n\r\nMirrors reflect, but not perfectly. At the very least they reverse the image that they\'re reflecting. We\'re only using mirrors, however, as a metaphor for reflection or replication. \r\n\r\nDue to the size and complexity of most of these mirroring endeavors, formal or informal organizations are established to tackle the job. For many reasons organizations that mirror to some degree the area within the overall environment that they are focused on are likely to have more success than those who don\'t. An institution is society\'s attempt to make a \"machine\" whose output is of a desired type. It reflects (however imperfectly) the desires of its creators and maintainers and its \"products\" are \"mirror images\" of each other (or at least have the same \"family resemblance.\") \"Mirror Institutions\" are those institutions that <i>reflect</i> or <i>reflect upon</i> other institutions or other realities. As such this pattern covers a very wide range. To cover this wide range we\'ve identified four important facets: the reflective mirror institution, the critical mirror institution, the alternative / generative mirror institution, and the flattering mirror institution. The boundaries between these different institutional mirror types aren\'t clear. It\'s hard in other words, to know where one ends and another begins. And the \"mirror\" itself (at least the metaphorical mirror we\'re talking about) is a constructed object whose object is implicitly or explicitly what it\'s set up to be and what it has come to be (while realizing, of course, that the characteristics are not completely knowable either but are subject to interpretation themselves &mdash; <i>via another mirror.</i> And, like all mirrors, the reflections can be seen from many angles.\r\n\r\n<b>The reflective mirror institution </b> is used to help us understand without bias some aspects of the \"real world.\" This institution needs to reflect the most salient aspects of its object back to the people who need to understand the object. Scientists ideally employ this type of mirror institution when they endeavor to understand the complex and intricate relationships within the physical environment. \r\n\r\nJames A. Wilson in his essay \"Matching Social and Ecological Systems in Complex Ocean Fisheries\" states that the \"mismatch of ecological and management scale makes it difficult to address the fine-scale aspects of ocean ecosystems, and leads to fishing rights and strategies that tend to erode the underlying structure of populations and the system itself.\" He goes on to state that \"This is likely to be achieved by multiscale institutions whose organization <i>mirrors</i> the spatial organization of the ecosystem and whose communications occur through a polycentric network.\"\r\n\r\nProblems can result arise if people believe that they\'re using a reflection that has perfect fidelity or if they\'re work is overly influenced by ideology.\r\n\r\n<b>The critical mirror institution </b> is used to uncover, analyze and expose the failings of another institution. Using the explicit philosophy, goals, and practices of the institution itself to show the stark contrast between their often noble rhetoric and what they\'re actually doing is a common approach. In the U.S., for example, the OMB Watch organization performs a \"watchdog\" function on the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within the U.S. government. The Bretton Woods project uses the decisions made by global economic powers at the 19__ Bretton Woods meeting as the basis for its critique of international capital and its institutional handmaidens. \r\n\r\n<b>The alternative / generative mirror institution </b> is used to develop &mdash; and propagate &mdash; alternatives to existing institutions. Governments in exile are one use of this pattern, as are community banks, whether they\'re in Venezuela or other countries. Sometimes the alternative is then mirrored into multiple versions of itself. Federated institutions that are <i>loosely</i> connected to each other and more-or-less the same type of species represent a good way to develop strength globally while maintaining local control. This was used in the realm of independent, non-commercial communication, including community access television, community networks and the Independent Media Centers movements. \r\n\r\nThe World Social Forum is a blend of two mirror institution facets: the critical and the alternative / generative; it established itself as a counter-forum to the World Economic Forum which promotes alternative ideas and visions. The World Social Forum is also being mirrored in the form of regional and thematic forums. \r\n\r\n<b>The flattering mirror institution </b> is an existing mirror, sometimes called an infinite mirror that is self-referential, often self-indulgent, self-deceiving, self-reinforcing, and sycophantic. That is, to a large degree, the state of the media today, endlessly reflecting upon itself like an echo chamber. \r\n\r\n[Note that media reflects society &mdash; however incompletely &mdash; back to itself. As Israeli journalist Gideon Levy of the Haaretz newspaper pointed out \"The Palestinians know what the Israelis are doing.\"]\r\n\r\nThere are several ways by which to look at any mirror institutions &mdash; especially when setting one up. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object or environment &mdash; <i>What</i> is standing in front of the mirror?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reflection &mdash; <i>What</i> is being reflected?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on the reflection &mdash; <i>What</i> are you seeing in the reflection? Should you be looking for other things?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience &mdash; <i>Who</i> is (or should be) peering into the mirror institution?\r\n\r\nDoes relying exclusively on \"reflections\" mean that wholly new institutions can\'t be devised? Although brand new institutions can be created through a series of partial changes, this argues for more of an intelligent (or pragmatic, efficient or opportunistic) design, rather than creation. Decentralized Intelligence Agency?!\r\n\r\nChallenges: Adopting and realigning when necessary. Maintaining a network with like-minded organizations &mdash; mirror or not. The \"mirror\" approach is <i>ecological</i> &mdash; but who\'s doing the \"higher level\" work?? Governments exists to (or should exist to) sort out (or at least assist with the sorting out process) issues related to rights and responsibilities &mdash; who (and what) can do something and who (and what) <i>should</i> do something. Associated with this is the task of developing (and exercising) incentives to encourage people to do the right thing and penalties for those who don\'t.\r\n\r\nThis is a pattern for <i>conscious adaptation.</i> A pattern transformation, since culture is propagated by its institutions. This is very much an analogy to basic evolutionary theory. Mirroring implies copying -- but generally copying with changes made to one or more aspects of the original in the process. <i>Liberating Voices is a mirror of A Pattern Language.</i>', 'Although this pattern is  may be a bit heavy on abstractions, we believe that the institution-as-mirror metaphor can be very useful primarily due to the questions it brings to the surface. The German playwright, Bertolt Brecht told us that \"art is not a mirror held up to reality, but a hammer with which to shape it.\" The mirror institutions that we create must also to a large degree be put to the same purpose.', NULL, 572, 876, '2006-12-11 10:31:07', '2006-12-11 10:29:42', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(304, 294, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Patients and the public traditionally have very poor, if any, access to information in their medical records. Unless they are with a personal doctor who knows them well, many patients have great difficulty describing their condition accurately. At the same time, the clinician whom they are seeing is expected to provide excellent care without having up-to-date information about their patient\'s health. To compound the problems further, medical records often contain inaccuracies of which neither patient nor medical providers are aware.', 'Over many centuries, medicine has identified and studied diseases, and developed treatments that now benefit individuals and societies. However, the more treatments there are, the more they need careful monitoring for serious side effects or interactions with other treatments or conditions a patient may have. Patients therefore need increased contact with the medical profession, and this contact is increasingly fragmented among many practitioners and disciplines. This complexity creates unnecessary tests and clinician appointments, as well as an increasing risk of litigation. Patients and the public see rising costs, more demands on their time, and decreasing understanding of their health.', 'As healthcare in developed countries becomes more complex, more sophisticated and expensive systems are being put in place, with no proof that delivery of care is improving. Inasmuch as these systems succeed in reducing costs, they tend to benefit the large public and private healthcare providers who sponsor them. They constitute ever more effective electronic filing systems for information about patients, but which those patients neither see nor use.\r\n\r\nWe live in a world of choice, and if there is little access to information about patients there is plenty of other information for them. More and more, the public seeks information so as to choose among their options for treatment. At the same time, more and more is available on the Internet (e.g. www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk) for those who want high quality information about health and well-being. \r\n\r\nSimply providing information is a job half-done. Until patients can work with their own health indices, such as blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and diabetes status, for example, they will find it difficult to relate information they find on websites to their own health. Secure systems already exist for patients to add blood pressure and blood sugar data to their records (UK Doctors, 2003). Clinicians welcome such information when determining a patients treatment management plan, especially if it can be easily found in one place. Clinicians who have experienced patient-maintained personal health records in become enthusiastic about the practice (Protti, 2005).\r\n\r\nTraditionally, the medical practitioner has provided a bridge between medical knowledge and the patients themselves. If a treatment plan did not perfectly match the patients needs, or if the patient was challenged by changes or crises, then the practitioner would take responsibility. Nowadays, there is seldom a single clinician involved in any patients care; no single person is in a position to mediate between the complexities of medical technology and the real-world experience of the patient. Patients themselves are willing to contribute to this role; they are clamoring for access to their full electronic health records so as to see for themselves what clinicians have written about their individual consultations, the results of tests they have undergone, letters that have come back from specialists, and what medications they have been prescribed both in the present as well as in the past.\r\n\r\nFulfilling the goal of active patient involvement in healthcare through access to medical records offers many opportunities and challenges. Patients could verify the accuracy of their medical records (Cross, 2005), and access their medical records wherever in the world they travel. Given proper controls for privacy and confidentiality, patients could share their information with others if they so wish. Given professional protocols between medical practices (the lack of which has led to bad outcomes for patients in the past), availability of information on patients should be protected at all points of healthcare service delivery. Some patients may find some information in their records upsetting, while equivalent information may help in the treatment of other patients or other conditions. Patients may need protection from seeing some information about themselves before a clinician has discussed it with them, and this may limit a patient\'s choice to access to full information. Information about a patient gleaned from a third party requires careful treatment before it is entered into the record. \r\n\r\nThe clinicians role as mediator between medical expertise and the patients experience will never go away, but it will change. Some of the opportunities of patient access to medical records may save clinician time, and others may not. Some patients will thrive on the ability to combine health information on the Internet and elsewhere with information about themselves from their medical records; others will not. With the right of online access to medical records comes the responsibility to deal with the information presented on a computer screen. The informed and responsible patient, comfortable with interpretive tools for making sense of medical data, has greater trust and confidence in the medical profession. Such changes in health behavior cannot be left to the technology and the information; they may require emotional support that depends upon some degree of human intervention.\r\n\r\nOnline recording of medical information by patients is already being done (www.ihealthrecord.org; www.healthspace.nhs.uk). Online patient access to medical records is beginning (www.paers.net; Bos, Fitton & Fisher, 2006), and it presents a cutting-edge challenge for practical trust between patient and clinician, and amongst medical providers. Medical records are being put online anyway, and over time they will become increasingly interoperable; the challenge is to make record access not merely a cost reduction measure for administrators and providers, but a tool for patients and their families to participate in their own healthcare.', 'Use patient access to online medical records as a bridge between the precise art of medical science and its practice as the patient experiences it. Let the public, patients, clinicians and other healthcare providers have up-to-date access to accurate medical information, regardless of location. Develop robust systems to protect privacy and confidentiality. Above all, educate and encourage practitioners and the public in patients use of online medical records to actively manage their health.', NULL, 855, 788, '2006-10-29 23:23:44', '2006-10-29 21:45:37', NULL, NULL, 'Tameside & Glossop PCT, UK', NULL, 363, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(305, 295, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Some of the the skills of citizenship, like basic communication and cooperation, grow from skills we learn in daily life.  Others, like deliberating with others, defining problems, collaboration on common projects, and organizing are not so basic: they, often, need to be learned. Not long ago, associations and intermediary institutionssocial and professional clubs, religious congregations, neighborhood schoolsrooted in local communities were the main places where these skills were learned. Today, there are fewer contexts in everyday life to learn them. People are less connected in and to local communities and often learn about what\'s important in the media. Increasingly, general discussion about political and civic issues is occuring on and through the Internet.  But it is easier to find information on the Net than to learn reflexively with others. The Net only partly lends itself to learning collaborative citizenship skills.  Further, many lower-income people, in the U.S. and around the world, still lack access to the Net. Therefore citizenship schools are needed to build civic skills in both local communities and on the Net.', 'In order to act effectively, people need to learn and apply the skills of citizenship.  Everyone who wants to find a democratic and lasting solution to deep and complex problems needs these skills and they are open to anyone to learn and teach. But there are also experts-civic practitioners, government officials and civil servants, teachers and scholars, civic and community organizers', 'Citizenship Schools originated in South Carolina in 1959, and quickly spread throughout the South through the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee.  In the late 1950s many Southern states had literacy tests, that required people to be able to read and write, and sometimes answer \"citizenship\" questions (generally designed to exclude blacks from voting).  Teaching large numbers of African-Americans in the South to read, write, and learn about citizenship was critical in the larger struggle for civil rights, including the right to vote.  According to Andrew Young and Ella Baker, movement leaders, the Citizenship education program was the \"foundation on which the entire movement was built.\" (1)  But communities with Citizenship Schools had few ways to make connections with other communities that lasted over time. Eventually, as the early fights for civil rights were won, the schools faded.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the schools lived on through the decades that followed in hundreds of civic training programs conducted by organizations and local communities.  Faith-based community organizations like the Industrial Areas Foundation train local clergy and lay organizers who learn to conduct campaigns and forums to build consensus on issue agendas like housing, school reform or job training. Environmental watershed, forestry, eco-system restoration and justice movements and others, teach citizens and youth to collect data and monitor environmental quality while building skills of civic trust and cooperation. And new civic movements to build a new model of the public and civic university are growing, like the Council on Public Engagement at the University of Minnesota . \r\n\r\nCitizenship Schools have also beeen tried online. In 1994, the American Civic Forum met to try to address a widely perceived crisis in political life and civic culture in the U.S.  The Citizenship Schools were an imoprtant model and a Civic Practices Network (CPN)  was built, to use the newly emerging technology of the Internet to build skills of citizenship.  CPN,  launched that year,  sought to facilitate broad and multimedia sharing of best cases, civic stories, mutual evaluations, and mentoring opportunities. Other independent civic networks also emerged around this time, including LibertyNet in Philadelphia, and Civic Net. Despite the growth of the Internet, however, no broad network connected and nurtured these activities.\r\n\r\nAs the web matured beginning around 2000 finding information on many topics of civic interest-public deliberation, the environment, youth, education, health care, communication-became relatively easier for individuals. But the new problem was how to link these groups together to not only provide information in their own specialized subfields, but to create an active environment for teaching, learning, and collaboration while also building a larger sense of solidarity in citizenship. National civic portals to aggregate the growing number of civic sites and discussions on the Net were one proposed answer.  But by 2003 or so with the emergence of the blogosphere, the topology of the web itself suggested that distributed links among widely dispersed civic sites might lead to new kinds of collaboration in which a great deal of the work of gathering and connecting is done by sites in the mid-range. This is the level most appropriate for new citizenship schools on the web.\r\n\r\nTherefore to build Citizenship Schools in local communities and institutions it is necessary to build a framework that can support many local organizing efforts with curricula and training routines that are distributed, shared, inexpensive, flexible, and sustainable. These can be done in local communities, through institutions like schools and universities, and on the web.\r\n\r\nLocal citizenship schools would necessarily be the result of pooled efforts among many active local civic organizations across different areas. Many could benefit from local government support.  In Seattle, for example, the Department of Neighborhoods provides leadership and skills training to many neighborhood, environmental, and other civic groups.\r\n\r\nCitizenship Schools through university extension and outreach could train new expert practitioners rooted in local communities.  For example at the University of Minnesota, the Council on Public Engagement reaches out to both scholars and academic staff to redefine the teaching and research mission of the publci university. Potentially, certificates and university credit through university extension services and community colleges could provide individuals valuable learning resources that also support and reinforce the extended investment of time, attention, and civic commitment. \r\n\r\nNew Citizenship Schools on the web could allow collective learning in a distributed, asynchronous environment; help frame a broad civic agenda collaboratively through distributed discussion;  and form a mid-range network of portals to focus attention without the intial high costs of building national space.  Schools on the web could support and integrate both local and statewide efforts.  The CPN is one online model indicating that there is  significant demand online for serious learning material about civic practice. Deliberative-Democracy.net demonstrates how key blogger-editors can be recruited for a civic site and distribute the labor of a serious, ongoing conversation.  The Liberating Voices Project [check best name] is also a key example of a distributed learning collaborative. \r\n	\r\nFor the pattern to be realized online, moderate-sized hubs with committed editors will need to be seeded and a few models created.   Possibly,  Citizenship Schools on the web could ally with university partners, particularly in civically oriented extension programs, to provide credentials and a modest flow of support.  Their life-cycle is potentially renewable. If a network of citizenship schools succeeds, it could become self sustaining, using commons models with relatively little ongoing external support.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge in building Citizenship Schools on a commons model is sustaining energy and collaboration, and maintaining a high quality of information.  As noted, a commons model requires moderate levels of commitment from a wide core.  Many of the contributers will be citizens, academics, policy makers and administrators with other jobs and commitments.  Rewards will be instrinsic.  A second challenge is to get citizens to commit time to learning, not to  just \"graze\" for information. \r\n\r\nThe main critics of the concept might say that Citizenship Schools are an anachronism and depend on communities of face-to-face solidarity that are less relevant by the year.  Learning doesn\'t take place this way anymore, despite the fact that the Citizenship Schools would be on the web.  Further, getting individuals to make long-term commitments at adequate levels will be nearly impossible.', 'There are five basic steps to promoting this pattern: (1) Build Citizenship Schools in local communities, institutions and online that can aid collaborative learning; (2) Develop a sites (local and virtual)  that include active learning and  civic curricula that can be widely shared. (3) Find citizens (lay leaders and experts both) who can serve as teachers and editors who can make minimal but real commitments; (4) Build templates to aid the spread of learning; and (5) Create new forms of civic credentials that provide value to both individuals and communities.', NULL, 770, 745, '2006-10-18 17:00:57', '2006-10-12 12:46:54', 'Brandeis University, Dept. of Sociology', NULL, 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', NULL, 316, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

In American political life, consider the longevity of key political journals and how they have not only reflected trends and movements but helped define the movements themselves and provided an arena for its participants to learn about and from one anotherthat strand of radical liberalism that has characterized The Nation from its inception as a vocal anti-slavery voice, the descent from progressive liberalism to neoconservatism represented by The New Republic, the development and fracturing of the radical political culture and politics of eastern European Jewish immigrants as found in The Partisan Review, Dissent, and Commentary. \r\n\r\nIn the field of community media and technology, the Community Technology Review (www.comtechreview.org) reflects several useful pattern features of current community-building journalism:\r\n\r\n	CTR has served as the formal and informal publication of both the Community Technology Centers\' Network, www.ctcnet.org, the country\'s oldest and largest association of nonprofit and community organizations dedicated to providing emerging technology resources for those who don\'t ordinarily have effective access, and of the Association for Community Networking (www.afcn.org), the affiliation of institutions and individuals interested in developing community-wide information resources and tools. CTR has covered key directions and issues of its two prime organizational partners by placing them within the developments of the wider field of community media and technology. Thus, for example, the fall 1999 issue was a joint production of CTCNet, AFCN, and the Alliance for Community Media (ACM, www.alliancecm.org), the national association of community cable public, education, and governmental (PEG) access centers; ACM and community cable access center development receive on-going coverage.  CTR has maintained close relations with the Community Media Review, ACM\'s official publication; with the fairly-recently established Journal of Community Informatics (http://ci-journal.net), the international journal of what is emerging as the emerging academic discipline of the field, especially outside the United States; with the Digital Divide Network, the online communication environment (at www.digitaldividenetwork.org) that has done so much to address issues involving the problem identified in its name; and with the Nonprofit Technology Enterprise Network (www.nten.org), the association of nonprofit technology assistance providers, and has offered  ongoing coverage of NTEN, Circuit Riders, CompuMentor/TechSoup and other organizations/developments in this part of the field. To the degree it is a model, CTR suggests that coverage of key organizations in a field provide a useful map that can be of assistance to both the experienced actor and the new participant looking for information and guidance.\r\n\r\n	CTR is published simultaneously on-line and in hard copy, using state-of-the-art tools most appropriate to each environment.  The developing on-line environment has been designed with open source publishing tools (Movable Type/Drupal) that provide a large number of embedded hyperlinks for readers to easily explore special areas and references in depth, extensive searching capacity throughout the archives (www.comtechreview.org/issue.php), interactive options for reader comments/additions and communication with authors and editors.  Desktop publishing is tied to appropriate printer and print-on demand options for hard copy production and distribution, providing a tangible publication for those readers and occasions where hard copy availability is especially appropriate and useful.  With the growing number of links to community-produced audios and videos, CTR provides an integrated multi-media platform that models a variety of approaches that can be used.\r\n\r\n	Articles are written by a combination of recognized leaders in the field and first-time authors who have worked on innovative projects and new resources.  With first-time authors, editorial staff have expended substantial time in providing writing and editorial assistance.  Overall, the tone and approach towards the reader is one that assumes an interest and some familiarity with the field but one that seeks to provide explanations and meanings when technical or field \"jargon\" or acronyms are used; in general the CTR seeks to welcome the reader into an on-going conversation among some of the major practitioners and leaders in the field (hence the inclusion and important role of photos of authors and individuals who are participants in the events covered).  In contrast to so-called \"objective\" or \"neutral\" journalism and reportage, movement building journalism engages both the producers and readers in a way that builds and strengthens their communities.', 'Develop journalism and communication venues that present news, events, and developments in a field in-depth, covering key organizations and institutions to offer a map and guide, using the most appropriate communication tools for participant leaders and actors.

Particularly, for adult populations looking to increase their understanding on relevant subjects, the option of pursuing formal training is not conducive due to the investment in time and extra resources it takes. As a result, people find it difficult to acquire the skills necessary for them to address a radically changing global economy, and thus many capable people continue to remain behind.', 'In cities, in villages, in the work place, or an internet cafe, even in a coffee shop amongst friends, learning can and does take place. Individuals and groups of people can come together to share their knowledge in structured or non structured ways to actively engage one another to mutually build each others understandings. When other methods of learning are not available, and yet the skills necessary to gain better employment, or the building of awareness on specific issues facing a community are needed for achieving greater livelihoods; informal learning processes can serve as an effective alternate route to meet the needs of communites and individuals.', 'In a variety of settings from the workplace to village level development initiatives, informal learning through group interactions and individual self-teaching can be an effective tool for developing new skill sets, alternative ideas and even new approaches to advancing livelihoods.\r\n\r\nWhat is informal learning? There is a hot debate among many educators as to what it really is, especially since its practice has become more common place within developed countries as businesses and employees attempt to stay abreast with the latest developments in technologies, and management practices so that they can collectively and individually remain competitive in a market driven environment.\r\n\r\nDefinition:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Informal work-related adult education activities that take place without an instructor. Examples of such activities include on-the-job demonstrations by a supervisor or coworker; on-the-job mentoring or supervised training; self-paced study using books, videos, or computer-based software; attendance at brown-bag or informal presentations; and attendance at conferences, trade shows, or conventions related to ones work or career (nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/glossary/i.asp).</li>\r\n<li> Occurs in everyday life and may not even be recognized as learning by the individual. For example, using a television guide may not be equated by an individual as having learned how to use a table. Related concepts/terms include: incidental learning (www.nald.ca/adultlearningcourse/glossary.htm). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTo better illustrate, here is a visual aid used to describe informal learning processes based upon information need. <br />\r\n<center><img src=\"http://ottersurf.com/InformalLearning/InformalLearning.gif\" /> </center><br />\r\nIt has been cited that, \"<i>Many times we can find the answer in the world around us, through either people, or formal courses, or bits of information. When it\'s not found (whether it doesn\'t exist or a search is incomplete), we go into a problem-solving mode. Then we need data, and analytical frameworks. If we do it in conjunction with others, we need collaboration and/or communication tools. Finally, if we solve it, we (should) close the loop by either adapting the materials to account for this problem in the future, or to create new material (Quinn, 2002)</i>\".\r\n\r\nIn the developing country, informal learning has gained a reputation as a tool for meeting a number of goals that not only include skills training, but also civic and health related education that can be acquired through individual inquiry, as well as through group interactions. Similarly, adult literacy projects that utilize an informal education approach (predominately among women populations) have gained increasing prevalence. In fact, women participants of local self-help groups often support one another through imparting knowledge to one another, they can help to tutor each other in their homes for building up literacy and educating each other on personal finance.\r\n\r\nWhen done in a group context an informal learning project can consist of a number of group led demonstrations that relate to managing ones personal finances, to starting a business, as well as how to use a computer for e-mail and even how to access your political representatives. The learning spaces are as dynamic and varied as the topics and the people often involved in them. Sometimes these groups are started through simple conversations among neighbors, or the group is seeded with support by an outside agency that brings some structure to the initial group development but after time allows the groups to be autonomous and define its own interests and pursuits.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, online learning groups can assist its members in learning new software, or computer programming. Take for instance the number of user forums dedicated to asking and answer technology related questions. This exchange among participants constitutes an informal learning group in which information is shared that ultimately builds upon the skills of the participants. In this online dialogue, individuals bring to the group their own experiences and expertise to share with other members of the group to help support a mutual sharing of knowledge. Even those not openly communicating with the group can benefit from finding answers to their own questions. As new doors are opened through this process new levels of curiosity emerge that can aid in the further participation in the group. \r\n\r\nWhile these types of learning communities are contingent upon access to information technology; in other contexts these groups can meet within their geographical proximity. <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=625\">Community animator</a> can act as a facilitator by asking participants questions that help them ask new questions or find answers to question that they may have not known how to answer before. \r\n\r\nRegardless of how a group is organized the informal learning group serves two basic functions to provide access to information and knowledge creation as well as evoking a deeper level of individual curiosity among participants and to prompt them towards greater levels of self-enrichment, whether that be for financial gains or merely inner personal gains.\r\n\r\nThough informal learning has gained greater focus over the years within development related education and beyond, technologies and access to information resources can make this pattern difficult to effectively utilize. While usage of these groups in development initiatives is high its difficult to ascertain whether or not they have had the level of benefit being represented through the increased effectiveness among employees with the corporations of more highly developed countries. While, this does not mean that informal learning groups are inadequate but it perhaps highlights the acceleration of learning possessed by those who have greater access to information on a larger scale. For this reason this pattern could be made more effective within a development related context through the linking with other patterns that emphasize technology infrastructure an alternative access to information for groups.', 'As an approach to improving the capacities of peoples involved in any number of development schemes designed to address local livelihoods, informal learning groups can provide an alternative avenue for supporting life-long learning spurring individual curiosities and the acquisition of new skills. \r\n\r\nCommunity leaders, self-help groups, development agencies and local employers can all act as initiators in the upstart of informal learning groups and encourage and overall culture of participatory learning geared to meet the interests and needs of the community. All of these can be done through communities meetings, general or directed interactions during tea/coffee breaks, these opportunities can be pursued and developed at the local internet cafe or even time can be set aside by employers who realize the benefits of supporting a more educated and curious workforce.\r\n\r\nOverall, the pattern tends to be mutually reinforcing as knowledge is created curiosity tends to be ignited furthering greater levels of self and group directed investigations. It\'s up to individuals, groups, communities and businesses to promote these endeavors, and thereby increase the intellectual capabilities of its local residents.', NULL, 718, 741, '2006-10-18 17:03:30', '2006-10-09 12:57:17', NULL, NULL, 'The Public Sphere Project & St. Mary\'s University', NULL, 284, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

People can become discouraged in their work toward some common good. They suffer a dissonance between, on one hand, their enthusiasm for an uplifting cause and, on the other, the gritty reality of bringing it about. What seems at the outset to be a life-enhancing enterprise can produce frustration, burnout and turnover of group members.', 'To pursue a shared goal is to seek a positive impact on the world: what David Cooperrider (1990) describes as a heliotropic movement, toward the light of a positive image of the future. As long as the group visualizes the positive contribution that its work will make, it will approach its work with optimism and hope. If pursuing the goal appears as the remediation of a deficit rather than movement toward a positive image, over time a focus on the negative will emerge.', 'Conflict can affect a group of people positively or negatively; it can be functional or dysfunctional. Some level of conflict can lead to creativity, responsiveness to change, and learning from experience. Conflict becomes dysfunctional when it produces feelings of hostility, interferes with honest communication, and distracts from the shared goal. People become frustrated when conflict prevents them from achieving what they want to achieve. They may react through aggression, compromise or avoidance; each of these makes the situation worse than it was. The result is a diversion of the groups attention to perceived problems with the collective enterprise: a language of deficit in which not merely the shared goal, but the group itself becomes a problem to be solved.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Bellman writes of the commitment, passion, and aspiration for a larger life (2000, p. 68) which energize people who seek to change the world for the better. If we can see the beauty in our collaborations, we can release the creativity that comes from a compelling vision of a future worth working for. \r\n\r\nHuman beings, the groups and organizations we work in, and the world we inhabit all contain the potential for this larger life. Through consistent attention to what is alive, and to what can be alive in the future, we can become more alive. The belief that that people are good and that they respond positively to being treated accordingly is well-grounded in research on the Pygmalion effect (Cooperrider, 1990). We respond to positive images of ourselves by regarding others more positively: by noticing their successes, remembering their strengths, and seeing challenges from a positive aspect.\r\n\r\nAn appreciative approach adopts a fourfold cycle of discovery, dreaming, design and destiny (Cooperrider & Whitney, 1999). It starts not by identifying a need or deficit, but by discovering the best of the current situation. It dreams or envisions what a better future might be, rather than analyzing what caused the deficit. In place of planning how to redress a deficit, it collectively constructs a design for a better future. Instead of acting to resolve a problem, this approach enacts a better future as its destiny.\r\n\r\nTo enact a better future suggests that a life-affirming end is a natural outcome of life-affirming means; we aspire to larger life in the world through larger life in ourselves and in our collaborations. If we learn to be drawn together by a positive image of each other, our collective effort enhances the potential for creative, fresh human action toward a life-enhancing purpose (Srivastva & Barrett, in Srivastva & Cooperrider, 1990, p. 386).\r\n \r\nThis can succeed if we continually revise our expectations of what we can achieve: to open new possibilities for ourselves, for those we collaborate with, and for the world we hope to improve. This requires that we continually learn by developing and revising the norms, strategies and assumptions which specify what work gets done and what work is important to do (Dixon, 1999, p. 48). We need to maintain a dialogue, with ourselves and others, about our individual and shared assumptions. \r\n\r\nTo better understand the value of others, we must suspend our own assumptions. People are seldom malicious or idiotic, but they often work from different assumptions; once we can understand these assumptions we can appreciate their value. For this reason, appreciating differences is critical to collaboration. Once we appreciate others concerns (Spinosa et al., 1997), we can embark on a dialogue about how to work together.\r\n\r\nAppreciative collaboration assumes that differences are valuable, and focuses attention on what is positive in any situation; in place of a vocabulary of deficit, it offers a forward-looking language of hope. Combined with a clear shared vision, appreciative collaboration allows us to achieve life-affirming goals through life-affirming means.', 'Positive images of the future lead to positive actions.

Technical, social and management issues are frequently involved, but the complex, inter-connected mix of factors at work is often confusing. There isnt a common language for understanding and modelling a particular organisations situation. Furthermore, until understanding is achieved, action-planning and change is even more problematic. However, ideas of sustainability drawn from the worlds of sustainable development, sustainable communities and environmentalism are familiar to many civil society activists and non-profits. Can these ideas be imported to form a holistic sense-making framework for understanding non-profit ICT use? More important, can the use of sustainability indicators also help inform action-planning and change, on the basis that diagnosis is half way towards a cure?', 'This pattern has emerged from extensive research, development and consulting on ICT in non-profit organisations (Plant, 2003). Non-profit organisations are key to organised social action and increasingly reliant on ICT in pursuing their missions, especially as they move from internal, efficiency-oriented, applications to those that support service delivery externally. But small non-profits are frequently vulnerable to, yet dependent upon, external expertise due to limited internal knowledge. Outside support is, furthermore, often technically-biased and solutions-focused. There is a need to facilitate internal capacity development and learning, especially on the organisational and political, not just technical, factors associated with ICT. The notion of sustainability as imported into this field embraces a holistic range of organisational, social and technical factors. These affect success and autonomy in the use of ICT, as well as technological longevity. The application of sustainability indicators to appraise ICT use in non-profits should interest both non-profit staff and outside helpers committed to a facilitative approach. Those needing a holistic understanding of a particular organisational situation, and those looking to move towards action-planning for change and improvement in ICT use, should benefit.', 'A sustainability model was originally constructed, as an analytic abstraction for research purposes, to model the suggestion that three main factors, each with sub-factors, might explain sustainability or its absence in non-profit ICT. \r\nThe top-level factors were inspired by the triple bottom line in sustainable development (Henriques & Richardson, 2004) combined with information systems theory. They are associated with longevity (technical factors which affect IT quality and life expectancy), success (management factors which affect the overall impact of ICT use on the organisation) and autonomy (empowerment factors which affect the extent of appropriate relationships with outside expertise). A three-segment graphical representation was created to summarise and integrate these factors visually.\r\n\r\nA method of appraising sustainability operationally in any given non-profit was derived from the theoretical model. A questionnaire asks respondents to agree or disagree with assertions associated with sustainability in each of the three main areas, using a five-point Likert scale. Drawing on Bell and Morse\'s (1999; 2003) approach to sustainability indicators, these qualitative responses are plotted on a three-segment diagram similar to the theoretical model. This results in a visual impression of sustainability, as subjectively interpreted by the organisational stakeholder(s) taking part.\r\n\r\nA full \"Information Systems Healthcheck\" service was then designed (Plant, 2001). The consultant first gathers and preliminarily analyses sustainability appraisal data from completed questionnaires. A face-to-face meeting then takes place, at which feedback is offered, and the situational diagnosis is discussed with client representative(s). The consultation then moves towards initial action planning and change. Possible areas for improvement are drawn directly from the graphical sustainability appraisal \"plot\" and respondents annotations.\r\n\r\nSpecific action-plans that might bring about change and improvement are identified, focusing on segments where sustainability appears to be weakest. The follow-up to this part of the process involves a wider cross-section of the client organisation\'s staff being canvassed if possible in order to confirm, enrich or challenge the situational diagnosis and the action-planning steps emerging.\r\n\r\nEvaluation of the healthcheck service suggests that it leads to new insight for client organisations. Key phrases appearing on evaluation questionnaires emphasise the strengths of a completely outside perspective that forces the issue to give participants an understanding of context and make recommendations from an unbiased viewpoint following critical review.\r\n\r\nInsight appeared to be based largely on bringing to the surface ideas that were already latent within the organisation, newly articulated and legitimised as a result of the engagement. It was therefore argued that internal capacity can be unlocked by employing the external facilitator in the role of a sounding board. Drawing out multiple perspectives through this participative approach appeared particularly important.\r\n\r\nThe crucial requirement for the client to take ownership of the process cannot yet be taken for granted. For this reason and others, further action research is needed to confirm or challenge the findings. Follow-up work is time-consuming and demanding for clients, particularly if, as suggested during the healthcheck, the consultants definitions of health and sustainability are to be challenged, reviewed and appropriated to suit local conditions and culture. \r\n\r\nThe qualitative basis of this work also leads to its own challenges. The most effective sustainability appraisals have been those involving questionnaire responses from multiple stakeholders that express divergent views. Productive outcomes have resulted from the debate and discussion over the multiple subjective interpretations of sustainability that have emerged. Focusing on disagreement as well as agreement can of course generate conflict instead of consensus, so requires sensitive facilitation and careful management. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, given that as follow-up clients are encouraged to engage organisational stakeholders at all levels (a move that could generally be considered healthy), such conflict can be problematic for those in less powerful positions. More generally, the process may influence the existing power balance; this could either be positive or negative in any given organisation. As a minimum, this possibility must be taken into account.', 'Sustainability ideas were originally imported into the non-profit ICT field in order to construct an explanatory model for research purposes, but their utility goes beyond this. The use of sustainability indicators has led to a practical grounded tool for understanding real-world non-profit ICT situations. \r\n\r\nA common language for making sense of and modelling the organisational, social and technical factors involved in ICT sustainability in individual non-profits is now available. \r\n\r\nBut it has not only been used successfully to achieve situation diagnosis and understanding, it has also led non-profits towards practical action for change and improvement in ICT use. Although there is more work to be done, the core method, an \"information systems healthcheck\", involves a visual representation of sustainability that promotes accessibility, and a facilitative approach that can lead to empowerment and organisational learning. Furthermore, researchers concerned with industrial or other sectors have observed similarities with ideas such as capability maturity modelling, and this work may well have application beyond the non-profit sector.', NULL, 510, 438, '2006-10-26 18:02:57', '2006-10-25 01:48:38', NULL, NULL, 'University of the West of England, Bristol', NULL, 322, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Such a group is bound together by the common concerns of a diverse membership, and those who feel underserved within the group may dissipate the efforts of the group or take their energies elsewhere. Building upon and integrating shared concerns into a shared vision helps members to focus their involvement in the group, so as to better orient their energies toward the collective enterprise.', 'A McKinsey report on nonprofits states that not-for-profit organizations have a special need for a vision as a means to guide their actions and evaluate outcomes. A compelling, easy-to-understand description of how the nonprofit would like the world to change in the next three-to-five years, what role the organization will play in that change, and how the nonprofit will measure the success of its role (Kilpatrick & Silverman, 2004, p. 3), the vision should pervade the organizations activities: an ultimate guide for making decisions and setting goals in alignment with collective values and aspirations.\r\n\r\nA vision should express values, purpose, and progress toward a better future. It should be neither too specific nor too general. Detailed goals, though necessary, do not belong in the vision itself; they easily become outdated, either once they are attained or when unforeseen opportunities and unexpected consequences occur. On the other hand, noble sentiments and statements of principle do not always easily translate into action under complex circumstances.\r\n\r\nA shared vision should be clear and compelling, aspirational for a better world in the future, and describable in simple terms. It should be capable of being understood as a common purpose, and of acting as a guideline for evaluating decisions and outcomes on a continuing basis. Nanus (1992) recommends that a vision be challenging but realistic, and developed by people throughout the organization.\r\n\r\nThe content of a shared vision is less important than the life it brings to the organization. Peter Senge quotes Robert Fritz that \"It\'s not what the vision is, it\'s what the vision does.\" (Scharmer, 1996, para. 30). A shared vision comes from the individual visions of group members; it becomes a force for action through the process of becoming shared. The difference between the shared vision and current reality should generate energy for change. Through its use, a shared vision should ensure that strategic decisions and specific goals are aligned with the organizations values.\r\n\r\nTo provide both accountability and allegiance to collective values and goals, a vision must be successfully put into practice. According to Etienne Wenger, \"One can design visions, but one cannot design the allegiance necessary to align energies behind those visions.\" (1998, p. 229); members allegiance can, however, be encouraged in the way a group or organization enacts a shared visionhow its members live out their accountability to collective values and goals. One way to promote allegiance to a vision is to use and communicate it constantly; another is to promote behavior, both inside and outside the organization, which is consistent with the vision.\r\n\r\nA shared vision lives constantly in tension with fast-changing and unpredictable circumstances. To pursue a vision while ignoring what is practical and relevant cannot sustain an organization, yet the vision is an essential guide to action through a succession of new circumstances and possibilities. Brinckerhoff (2003) believes that not-for-profit organizations should respond flexibly to external demands, while remaining in alignment with the collective purpose. By maintaining the shared vision, an organization learns not only how to do better, but also what better to do; The world changes, and so must the vision. (Nanus, 1992, p. 20).\r\n\r\nA shared vision helps to guide an individual project with specific tasks and finite lifespan (Christenson & Walker, 2004). Developed in conjunction with stakeholders both within and outside the project members (for example, developers, funders, and the community at large), it helps people make sense of the project plan and their contributions to it. An easily understood, inspiring, credible and challenging vision can create and sustain the alignment of members energies, their enthusiasm and allegiance to the group, and their accountability to shared values and specific goals.\r\n\r\nWhen a community or civic project first begins, participants may be highly enthusiastic, each with a strong conception of what the project should be. It is tempting to jump right in and assume that everybody shares the same vision. Proceeding from this ambiguous and contradictory beginning may lead to division and hard feelings within the group, and to unsound early decisions that become \"built-in\" to the system. \r\n\r\nDeveloping a shared vision may be the single most important task for the group to accomplish at the outset. Developing shared perspectives on both the vision and the process for enacting it are indispensable for success. Good communication is essential; face-to-face group meetings, brainstorming and other methods of envisioning a collective future provide a forum for dialogue which e-mail, for example, can not address adequately.\r\n\r\nSteve Cisler suggests the use of a spoked circle as a graphical decision aid to fine-tuning the vision. The circle represents the \"space\" of decisions and goals, and the endpoints of the spokes represent the two possible extremes of each decision. Cisler (1994) shows an example of the spoked-circle used by the Silicon Valley Public Access Link (SV-PAL) Project. The upright spoke, for example, might be labeled \"architecture\" and the location of the small circle on the spoke near the \"distributed\" endpoint depicts the decision to use a distributed architecture instead of a centralized one. A point on the middle of a spoke would indicate an intermediate position between the views represented by the endpoints.\r\n\r\nThere are no stringent requirements as to how to use the tool. Simply identifying the spokes can be an important first step, as the spokes clearly show which decisions are to be made. It may not be critical to determine the exact location of the spot indicating a decision. In some cases, a group may decide to postpone a decision, but it is a group decision, nevertheless, that ultimately must be made with others in the group. If it hadn\'t been resolved, for example, whether the network should be free to use or whether there should be fees, the organizers could say, \"We\'re still trying to resolve this. Which approach do you think is best?\" The tool can be used as a way to explain compromises or transitional circumstances by showing the current point in relation to the direction along which the developers plan to proceed. For example, when the system is launched it might be deemed necessary to charge users a small fee, but ultimately the system would be expected to be free to use.', 'Create, communicate, enact and maintain a shared vision. Create the vision early in the life of any collective enterprise; it will guide the actions of the group or organization as a whole, and for individual projects that the group undertakes.

The lack of grassroots knowledge has proven problematic in that development schemes are often mismatched in scale and relevance to the communitys needs, abilities and liabilities. Thus the conceived solutions for encouraging community capacities and livelihoods fall short of their objectives.', 'Through their lived experience, community members trained in assessment techniques and information gathering can provide contextual understandings of the assets and liabilities a community possesses that would otherwise go unnoticed to the outside professional. Similarly they can act as agent for the process of <i>conscientization</i> and subsequent mobilization for peoples to pursue change and empowerment.', 'In response to the failures of \'top-down\' approaches to development, a shift towards emphasizing participation and empowerment have begun to make their way into the mainstream of development practice. This move toward \"bottom-up,\" \"farmer-to-farmer,\" and \"grassroots\" communication has been a fundamental reorientation. Following, the 70s and 80s, years often associated with the dark ages of development a new light has come about through alternative practices that seek to employ the communitys themselves in defining their needs, mapping out there assets and coming to terms with their own liabilities.\r\n\r\nThrough a variety of participatory processes both community members and development professionals have had the opportunity to jointly design community improvement schemes that are both appropriate to the community\'s needs and wants, as well sustainable and empowering.\r\n\r\nAs a result of relative success, the role of the community animator has become an increasingly important component for enabling this process of cooperation and participation between the development practitioner and the community members themselves. In some ways the animator acts as both initiator and on-going advocate for his or her community\'s development through regular open communication with both community members and the representative staff working in the area. \r\n\r\nIn the past highly educated teams of researchers and development field workers would enter a community and employ any number of assessment tools to identify community needs. Some of which were participatory in nature (see <a href=>Power Research</a> pattern). Upon return to their offices these assessments would be used to design various projects ranging from indoor lavatories, to treadle pumps, to community telecenters. In many cases it was shown that these projects failed to support the kind of long-term growth in peoples livelihoods they were thought to bring. Rather than looking at what the community wanted or needed from their cultural and social point of reference; these professionals designed projects relative to their point of reference.\r\n\r\nInstead of persisting with this paradigm, NGOs such as the <a href=http://www.iird.interconnection.org> Institute for Integrated Rural Development</a> (IIRD) have pursued vigorous development campaigns in Bangladesh. In this example the community animator has become a central agent for helping to identifiy and express the needs and desires of a community, as well as initiating and supporting change to include, <a href=>informal education</a>, ideas for <a href=><b>micro-enterprise</b></a>, and even supporting the creation of womens <a href=>self-help groups</a> that have enable a number of women in rural areas to gain access to credit and thus empower them to pursue economic generating activities.\r\n\r\nHere organizations such as IIRD would send exploratory panels out to the communities, as a \"get to know you\" campaign. Over a period of time they would identify predominately young men and women that they would sponsor for further education. The pool of students would often serve as the primary group that would go on to perhaps become powerful community animators.\r\n\r\nNot only were they given a valuable education they still retain those familial bonds to their community that often gives them an immediate advantage in having the lived experience of their particular area, as well the rapport of being a community member.\r\n\r\nHowever, problems of jealousy and apprehension can be potentially problematic and it is important that groups and agencies that do seek to draw advocates from the field they seek to assist find ways to mitigate the potential social conflict that might arise. Unfortunately, it may not be possible to completely eliminate it. But it is perhaps a far better approach than previous alternatives', 'The community animator can act as a critical link between the community and any <a  href=>NGO Collaborator</a>. It should be noted that by those in the field for social change that local citizens and activists can often better activate a communitys sentiments and bring about awareness for the possibility to realize change than an outsider who may be perceived to have little understanding of the real issues at stake. \r\n\r\nBeyond the processes of <i>concientization</i> that a community animator can bring to the process; NGOs can also assist these community members in training for information gathering and needs assessments to help refine the basic kinds of projects and programs that might be of benefit to a community.', NULL, 625, 743, '2006-11-19 18:03:49', '2006-11-17 10:54:23', NULL, NULL, 'The Public Sphere Project & St. Mary\'s University', NULL, 284, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Although access to information and resources is critical to overcoming poverty and alleviating the problems of people living in poverty, poor people and anti-poverty advocates traditionally have less access to the Internet and other communications technologies.\r\n\r\nAlthough poverty and computers do not make for an obvious alliance, it is clear the two worlds must connect unless we want to have a society where access to information and resources is only for those who can afford it.\r\n\r\nPublic access sites are rarely adequate to satisfy public need; users need people to help them do online research and free printers to print out forms and information. Hosts of public access sites need funding to keep equipment up-to-date and tech support to keep computers and Internet connections running smoothly. Lack of access to communication makes it difficult to connect communities in the anti-poverty world outside their local regions.\r\n\r\nPovNet is a non-profit society created in British Columbia, Canada in 1997. It is an online resource for anti-poverty advocates and poor people, created to assist poor people and advocates involved in the communities identified above through an integration of offline and online technology and resources. \r\n\r\nPovNet works with advocates and activists across Canada involved in direct case work and social action and justice.  Some of these groups include:\r\n\r\n* The National Anti-Poverty Organization (http://www.napo-onap.ca/), a national voice for poor people, working to eliminate poverty in Canada\r\n\r\n* The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (http://www.policyalternatives.ca/), a left-wing think tank doing research for change in social policy\r\n\r\n* Canadian Social Research Links (http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/), an all-inclusive resource for social policy information about poverty in Canada\r\n\r\n* DisAbled Women\'s Network of Ontario (http://dawn.thot.net/), an online inclusive community fostering virtual activism and individual empowerment locally and globally\r\n\r\n* The Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action (FAFIA) (http://www.fafia-afai.org/home.php), a coalition of over 50 Canadian womens equality-seeking and related organizations organized to further womens equality in Canada through domestic implementation of its international human rights commitments.\r\n\r\n* The Toronto Disaster Relief Committee (TDRC) (http://www.tdrc.net/), a group of social policy, health care and housing experts, academics, business people, community health workers, social workers, AIDS activists, anti-poverty activists, people with homelessness experience, and members of the faith community who provide advocacy on housing and homelessness issues and lobby the Canadian government to end homelessness by implementing a fully funded National Housing Program.\r\n\r\nPovNet has become an online home for advocates in BC and across Canada. Its Web site provides regularly updated information about issues and policy changes.\r\n\r\nUsing PovNet  resources is an interactive process. Advocates learn the tools because they find them useful in order to do the social justice and case work that they care about; poor and otherwise marginalized people find the Web site when they need information that is relevant to their lives.\r\n\r\nFor example, PovNet email lists have grown over the years into invaluable resources for specific campaigns (for example the Raise the Rates campaigns in both Ontario and British Columbia to raise welfare rates). They also provide an online support network for advocates working in sometimes quite isolated areas in British Columbia or in other parts of Canada.\r\n\r\nAs one advocate put it: \"I love the PovNet list - on the lighter side there\'s the kibitzing going on amongst the subscribers which often brings me to laughter - always a good thing in this job. On the serious side - the exchange of ideas and generous sharing of experience is a huge boon to those of us who often don\'t have time to pick up the phone to seek advice from our colleagues.\"\r\n\r\nAnother subscriber says: \"The lists that I am a subscriber provide me with first-hand current information on what issues are affecting BC residents and/or newcomers. I am able to provide useful information and referrals to some of the requests coming through PovNet lists. They are an invaluable and efficient resource for community advocates, settlement and family workers, especially those issues that are time-sensitive and need an immediate response.\"\r\n\r\nOther PovNet tools include a Web site which is updated once a month with new information, online education and training courses (PovNet U) for poor people (for example the course, \"Be Your Own Advocate\") and for advocates (\"Introduction to Advocacy,\" \"Disability Appeals\" and \"Tenants\' Rights\"), as well as an online space for anti-poverty community groups to have their own Web spaces, calendars, and discussion boards.\r\n\r\nPovNet is a flexible in that it can adapt to needs as specific campaigns emerge. For example, we set up an email list for a new campaign to raise welfare rates, and created an online hub for papers and press releases when a group of anti-poverty activists traveled to the United Nations in Geneva to speak on behalf of the social and economic rights of poor people in Canada.\r\n\r\nBuilding a successful online movement in anti-poverty communities includes, first and foremost, the people.  Start by finding local community workers who want to broaden their connections, getting together key people (without computers) to talk about what is needed and identify the technological limitations, communicate with advocates and activists in diverse anti-poverty communities, both urban and rural, First Nations, aboriginal, different cultural communities, disability groups, women, youth, seniors, workers, human rights and anti-poverty workers, and international anti-poverty workers.\r\n\r\nThen identify the barriers, which could include access to the technology (education, money,  literacy, language), how to share information, resources and skills between \"have\" and \"have-not\" advocacy communities (e.g. community advocates and advocates in funded agencies, etc.), researching how to provide online resources in languages other than English and how to provide an online space for poor people to communicate  and access information via public access sites and interactive Web-based resources.\r\n\r\nBarriers for advocates and activists using PovNet tools have changed over the years. Initially, fear of technology was a big factor. But as advocates observed its use as a communications tool, they taught and continue to teach each other. Money for computers and printers is an ongoing problem; as the technology demands higher-end equipment. For example, advocates in rural communities with dialup access get frustrated with attachments that take up all their dialup time. The anti-poverty work becomes harder as governments slash social services; the advocates have fewer resources to do their work. Technology cannot address such needs.\r\n\r\nDespite the difficulties, the network continues to grow, establish links with other organizations both in Canada and internationally, and exchange ideas and strategies for advancing social change.', 'The most effective online anti-poverty communities are constructed from the bottom up rather than the top down. Their resources are defined and created by advocates and poor people to address the need for online anti-poverty activism as it arises. Electronic resources can provide additional tools,  but they are activated and made useful by the underlying human and locally based networks where the work of advocacy is actually being done.', NULL, 126, 436, '2006-08-14 08:42:38', '2006-10-29 23:12:19', NULL, NULL, 'PovNet', NULL, 168, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Lack of assets, and stable employment lends a view that these peoples are not credit worthy, thus they are barred from a variety of economic opportunities.', 'Organizing groups to support collective and individual credit acquisition, as well as formal and informal skills training can assist peoples in accessing the capital necessary to initiate small businesses and ultimately help build livelihoods for families and communities.', 'A very basic description of the Self-Help Group (SHG) has been summarized by the Rural Finance Learning Center. According to their definition: \"<i> Self-help groups are usually informal clubs or associations of people who choose to come together to find ways to improve their life situations. One of the most useful roles for a self-help group is to provide its members with opportunities to save and borrow and it can act as a conduit for formal banking services to reach their members. Such groups can provide a guarantee system for members who borrow or they may develop into small village banks in their own right. In rural areas self-help groups may be the only way for people to access financial services </i>\" (2006).\r\n\r\nThe structure of the SHG is meant to provide mutual support to the participants by assisting one another in saving money, opening up cooperative banking accounts that help women and other peoples to build credit with a lending institution. The SHG also functions to support members through maintaining consistent contact among group members to aid the individuals savings goals, to help support the creation of these micro-enterprises. Often the SHG helps in the conception of these businesses and even the implementation of these enterprises upon receipt of the micro-loan.\r\n\r\nThe SHG also supports accountability for ensuring that the loans are paid back and the SHG can continue to include other members and support greater access to credit and capital to those within their community. SHGs also provide a space which facilitates the discussion of many issues pertaining to the communitys socio-economic, educational and health status. Thus, the formation of this group provides a forum to initiate many participatory activities (including training and awareness camps). \r\n\r\nThis process has also shown to increase confidence among participants, and help support greater levels of decision-making status in their society, particularly within South Asia. This hopefully will encourage members to participate and contribute in general social and political matters in their respective villages. \r\n\r\nAs peoples are supported in building their credit they in turn are able to apply for micro-loans geared towards a number of self-sufficiency based business ventures. Many of the business commonly financed consist of seamstress shops, beautician parlors, and in the rural areas these business can be as diverse as natural healing clinics, chicken farms and aqua-culture projects, to silk weaving or any number of handcraft based ventures.\r\n\r\nWhile a great number of SHGs have been initiated by communities themselves, many of the SHGs are implemented through the help of an NGO that can provide the initial information and support to establish these groups. Such information and support often consists of training people on how to manage bank accounts to include deposits, withdrawals and balancing of the cooperative and individual accounts. Similarly informal education regarding a number of possible trades can take place in order to build up the capabilities of the participants to function as business owners.\r\n\r\nBut the SHG has some instances shown problems that must be addressed when considering their use as a pattern of community empowerment. For instance, many of these people are in absolute poverty and the little that they do save can put a family in an already precarious financial situation in a worse of place.\r\n\r\nOther issues revolve around the nature of work and the family in developing countries where the women are often the primary householder while the male is involved in work outside the house. The creation of these businesses often adds greater levels of work upon women as they are committed to the SHG and the creation of their business to support their income and yet their household duties are still expected to be met by their husbands. In these situations the pressures can be immense to juggle the business, household chores and the rearing of children.\r\n\r\nHowever, in response to some of these problems many NGOs have sought to play a critical role in lessening that burden by offering school to children and thereby giving women members the ability to pursue their career goals by providing a place for their children to go while simultaneously providing education to those children that would otherwise be working at home. Despite some of the draw backs the role of the SHG is still a vital and growing component of bottom-up development, and hopefully eventuating self-designed development in the future', 'Despite the problems some of the participants have faced due to the changing nature of their socio-economic status; the SHGs offer one approach to create associations of support for some of the most economically marginalized groups within society. Through the desire of women and other members of the community these SHGs can provide an organized structure for providing employability and ownership for peoples otherwise left out.\r\n\r\nOverall, communities themselves can act to develop similar groups (or with the aid of NGOs working in the area), as these programs can be realized with relatively little resources from the outside. \r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the SHG is not a panacea to social and economic development, and should only be one part of a larger solution to addressing poverty in communities. Other patterns must be called in to address some of the social consequences that can arise from the creation of an SHG. \r\n\r\nCareful attention must be paid particularly to women as they are often the primary benefactors of the SHG and yet the amount of work involved is no less stressful and difficult for them. Other steps might also be taken to addresses these issues to pursue and integrated approach to supporting development.\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth guide to SHGs see: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/ae536e/ae536e00.HTM\">A handbook for trainers on participatory local development: The Panchayati Raj model in India.</a>', NULL, 624, 761, '2006-10-18 17:03:08', '2006-10-09 10:56:37', NULL, NULL, 'The Public Sphere Project & St. Mary\'s University', NULL, 284, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Neither community empowerment nor fundamental sustainability plays a central role in many of these interventionist projects. And just as bad, they fail to honor the basic desires and knowledge possessed by these people. Thus displacement, increased unemployment and the overall degeneration of livelihoods becomes the normative result of mis-planned, mis-interpreted and thus, mis-implemented development. Similarly, even among the well-meaning development NGOs a culture of dependence tends to emerge with communities being perpetually tied to the expertise and monetary assets that these organizations bring with them.', 'Before governments, international development agencies and corporate stake holders attempt to define the nature of development for a particular community or region (or for the world for that matter), peoples must proactively assert their own paradigm as a challenge to the problematic realties that have come from vertically planned development schemes, and to break out of dependency.', 'Stepping away from the interventionist model of development, self-designed or autonomous development emphasizes at its core development designed and implemented by the people it is intended to affect. While on one hand this pattern presents an orientation towards the practice and approach of development at one level, at another it is meant to be translated into the direct actions of peoples pursuing the right to define the trajectories of their lives, the lives of their families and their overall communities. It tries to avoid the assumption that all peoples want to be developed, rather it does assume that peoples wish to enjoy a certain type of life defined on their own terms and the hope is that they have the opportunity to realize that desire in their life-time.\r\n\r\nThe words self-designed or autonomous are meant to address the fundamental notions of power, who has it, who uses, and how its used and to what end. As a pattern that values autonomy, but also a notion of development towards greater well-being traditional as well as modern knowledge must be acknowledged, understanding that they do not always have to be perpetually competing forces, but when approached carefully they can be utilized to promote viable path towards community transformation that honors the social, cultural and political realities a community exists within. Thus, the overall basis of the self-designed development places both the responsibility and power of change into the hands of those who have been historically disempowered through the processes of traditional developmentalism.\r\n\r\nAt the level of orientating this process, its necessary to re-frame development and stress a redefinition of the roles between peoples in communities seeking transformation and the various outside agents who are working for authentic social and economic change. Here we would emphasize <b>facilitation</b> over the management and design on the part of the part of the so-called professional, and community independence and autonomy over dependence. \r\n\r\nTake for example, the Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) (See: <a href=\"\">Action Research</a>) so often thought of as the mainstay of the development practitioner seeking to design projects, becomes instead an awareness tool for community members themselves to guide their own decision making process on what steps are to be taken to better their livelihoods, and offer clear paths to achieving that. In fact this tool can be used by a community without the need for complex levels of understanding into social research and can be used in a relatively low-tech way within a variety of settings. Therefore, the role of the outside agent can be to act as observer and identify ways in which they can help a community realize their mutually defined goals.\r\n\r\nAt the level of implementation the pattern can guide specific actions to be taken up by communities to include any number of projects defined by a community. For example, projects can be anything from a system of check dams used to provide electricity to power a rural village; another project could be the construction of a primary school or health center for women. They can include the creation of farming cooperatives to ensure the community not only achieves the ability to provide sustenance, but can then also generate income by selling their products outside their geographical community.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the use of this pattern at this level will be context specific and must be shaped by the various needs and desires, and including the capacities and capabilities of peoples seeking to pursue this pattern of development. This recognizes that not all communities possess the same needs or desires, nor do the posses the same levels of capacity or capabilities. Therefore in one community where the level of civic capacity is high, as well as a great deal of cohesion and participation among community members, then a more autonomous approach to development is going to be more easily realized. \r\n\r\nYet, to a community that lack a certain level of capacity and cohesion it may be necessary for the community to seek the assistance of an outside agent to facilitate in the process. This could include consciousness raising, financial support, transfer of knowledge and so forth, but fundamentally any such assistance must be a result of the wishes of the community and brought forth based upon the terms and desires of those these plans are meant to assist.\r\n\r\nThere may however, be situations in which such a pattern may not be at all viable, or only very minimally. This is particularly true in situations of displacement, through war, famine or other outside forces that breaks a necessary level of cohesion due to fissure in the very nature of their communal ties, and thereby fragmenting the peoples capacity to coordinate and act collectively. In these situations, the pattern may still be utilized but it will be much more of a goal to be actualized by development agents who are seeking to ameliorate the problems associated with fragmented communities. The pattern thus becomes a guiding force for the interventionist, and care must be taken not to cross the boundary of creating development dependence among peoples.\r\n\r\nIn these situations it can also be potentially problematic as it can be difficult for agencies to relinquish control over development initiatives as community reconstitute themselves and gain a level of independence and cohesion that would allow for them to participate in a process of autonomous development.  And since its difficult to say when the work of an NGO is done in area there remains this tendency maintain a role of interventionism long after a community has acquired the capacity to define their own goals. It therefore begins to become the kind of development the outsiders envision and not that of the community.\r\n\r\nThus, this pattern not only becomes an orientation to community driven development but an orientation and guide by which NGOs themselves can pursue a process to empower communities by emphasizing any number of projects designed to empower peoples to regain control over their lives in the wake of a rapidly modernizing world.', 'First, those among the professional development community should not always assume that a community wishes to be or needs to be developed. Rather support to communities should be pursed based on invitation. For the communities themselves this is an opportunity to empower themselves and to project the ways in which they wish to interact and be defined in the process of modernization that is going on everywhere. It is an opportunity to exert their own sense of identity and influence their livelihoods as best and most effectively as possible in the face of so many outside forces that are consciously and unconsciously seeking to define their collective futures.\r\n\r\nWhen pursuing a development project peoples must come together, discuss, plan and decide what they want. If the community chooses to maintain a traditional way of life it becomes up to them on how they will protect that. And in the event that a community does seek outside assistance it is up to them to define the nature and terms of that relationship to those working with them from the outside. And for those with a low-capacity for truly implementing such an approach any initiative must incorporate the necessity of capacity building for communities to achieve a level in which they can envision their own development. Ultimately, the realization of a communitys independence rather than dependence in this world should be at the fore in such circumstances.', NULL, 626, 766, '2006-11-19 18:04:37', '2006-11-17 10:41:49', NULL, NULL, 'The Public Sphere Project & St. Mary\'s University', NULL, 284, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

According to Tourism Concerns Web site, some of the main negative effects of tourism include displacement of people (particularly native peoples living on their traditional lands), environmental damage from uncontrolled development, and water abuse. In examining water abuse its easy to find that the presence of tourists naturally means a much higher demand for water. Local communities normally do not benefit, and in most cases, are not allowed access to infrastructure built to ensure safe drinking water. The development of golf courses and hotel swimming pools are responsible for depleting and contaminating water sources for surrounding communities; this is especially true in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. An average 18-hole golf course soaks up at least 525,000 gallons of water a day - enough to supply the irrigation needs of 100 Malaysian farmers.\r\n\r\nEquations, an East Indian NGO promoting responsible tourism, documents several tourism projects that are moving ahead without local support.

In addition, unique cultural practices are at risk.  \r\nThe indigenous fishing community of Kasaragod is the last remaining community along the Keralam coast with traditional fishing techniques. They abhor over-fishing and adhere to sustainable harvesting practices. The community still practices the traditional sea courts where the community heads assemble at the place of worship every day to hear and decide on issues within the community.  \r\n\r\nThe Bekal project illustrates more. The government of Keralam has already begun acquiring land as cheaply as possible under public purpose and intends to sell the land to private and multi-national tourist organizations for this same price. To date, there is no Environmental Impact Assessment despite the fact that as planned it would violate national Coastal Regulation Zone rules.  Local community members are being denied due process through hearings that are a sham. \r\n\r\nFortunately, there are organizations that are becoming involved in the process of re-vitalizing community efforts to direct tourism. An extensive list of responsible travel organizations can be found on Tourism Concerns Web site, (http://www.tourismconcern.org.uk/).  Reference books also published by Tourism Concern include Good Alternative Travel Guide: Exciting Holidays for Responsible Travelers\" by Mark Mann, and the new, \"Ethical Travel Guide\" by Polly Pattullo, lists ethical and sustainable tourism in over 60 countries.\r\n\r\nGlobal Exchanges is a model organization in creating opportunities for Engaged Tourism.  Their Reality Tours operate give people \"the chance to learn about unfamiliar cultures, meet with people from various walks of life, and establish meaningful relationships with people from other countries.\"', 'Engaged tourism represents a shift in both attitudes and activity. Tourists traveling to developing nations shift their attitudes from participating in inexpensive fun abroad to participating in meaningful experiences in international communities. Interestingly, it is exactly the presence of western engaged tourists that assists in re-establishing the values, culture, status of local people and communities adversely affected by commercial tourism.', NULL, 622, 500, '2006-08-22 08:01:48', '2006-10-30 12:34:39', NULL, NULL, 'Evergreen State College', NULL, 341, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(317, 307, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'We usually think of technology as that which is designed by elite groups -- mostly male, mostly white, mostly upper class, etc. But the lay public can also be thought of as producers of technology and science. The \"smiley face\" emoticons we use in email, for example, were not designed by experts; it was ordinary people taking advantage of a flexibility in the system. Technology appropriation can be profound: Latino \"street mechanics\" for example created the Low Rider car which revolutionized their culture. Black teenagers created the \"scratch\" sound of rap by appropriating the turntable. Appropriated technology can help the disenfrachised gain social power. But there are three barriers. First, marginalized people often see science and technology as the enemy, a force to be resisted. Second, marginalized people often lack the education and physical resources for technology interventions. And third, designers (or at least the corporations they work for) do not necessarily see flexibility as something they should incorporate in their products. Of course not all cases of appropriated technology are happy stories: neo-nazi groups are also outside the centers of scientific production, and they too adapt and reinvent to gain power.', 'Barrier 1: science and technology as the enemy. Social critics of often cite \"technocracy\" as the evil which perpetuates disparity in social power. Thus oppositional groups which subscribe to this theory will tend to desire less technology and not more. We see this in the 1960s counter-culture, in the conflation of technology with patriarchy, and in race-based movements that see an original \"natural\" or \"pure\" identity that was later defiled by colonialism.\r\nBarrier 2: science and technology as unattainable. Our society tends to mythologize expertise, particularly that of science and technology, making lay interventions less attainable than they actually are. Many researchers suspect this serves to maintain elite priviledge and passive consumption.\r\nBarrier 3: designing for rigidity: Corporations can increase profits by forcing consumers to use their products or engage in limited behaviors: for example Microsoft\'s operating system created barriers to competing internet browsers.', 'In collecting the various case studies for our anthology (Eglash et al 2004), it became apparent that some examples made a stronger case for appropriation than others. Using that distinction, we developed the following three categories. You can think of these as being positioned along a spectrum from consumption to production (see figure above). \r\n\r\nThe weakest case, \"reinterpretation,\" is defined by a change in semantic association with little or no change in use or structure. That is, the lay person has changed only the meaning of the artifact, not its physical make up. Graffiti tags are a good illustration: the physical and functional aspects of a building are essentially unchanged, but the semantic claim to ownership, as a form of either cultural resistance or criminal turf war,is not trivial. The next stronger case, \"adaptation,\" is defined by a change in both semantic association and use. For example, the Bedouin society of Egypt, a relatively disempowered ethnic minority, found that cassette tape players, which were marketed for listening to music from the Egyptian majority, had an unused recording capability as well. They began to record their own songs, and this eventually led to the rise of a Bedouin pop star and the creation of new economic and cultural opportunities (Abu-Lughod 1989). Adaptation requires two technosocial features. First, an attribute of the technology-user relationship that Hess (1995) refers to as flexibility. For example, a calculator is less flexible than a word processor, which is less flexible than a personal computer. Second, it requires a violation of intended purpose. It is a mistake to reduce this to the intentions of designers; we also need to consider marketing intentions and common-sense or popular assumptions. In the case of Bedouin cassette players we have a pre-existing flexibility for recording that was intended by the designers, but this was obscured by the marketing focus on play-back only. Adaptation can be described as the discovery of a latent function, but that definition needs to be problemitized in the same ways that philosophers have debated whether mathematics is invention or discovery. The creativity required to look beyond the assumed functions of the technology and see new possibilities is a powerful force for social change, yet one that receives insufficient theoretical attention. \r\n\r\nThe strongest case for appropriated technology is \"reinvention,\" in which semantics, use and structure are all changed. That is, if adaptation can be said to require the discovery of a latent function, reinvention can be defined as the creation of new functions through structural change. Low-rider cars (see figure below) provide a clear demonstration of this combination. Although automobile shock absorbers were originally produced for decreasing disturbance, Latino mechanics developed methods for attaching them to electrically controlled air pumps, turning shock absorbers into shock producers (the cars can move vertically as well as horizontally). Low-rider cars violate both marketing and design intentions, but the new functionality was introduced by altering the original structure, rather than discovering functions lying dormant in the original artifact.  \r\n\r\nHaving studied appropriated technologies, what should we do with them?\r\n\r\nFirst, it is important to understand that in distinguishing strong versus weak cases for appropriated technology, we make no evaluation of ideology or effectiveness. One might, for instance, find more political success with reinterpretation than reinvention in a given case. It is, rather, more a question of how much involment the lay public can have in production versus consumption. \r\n\r\nSecond, appropriated technologies do not have an *inherent* ethical advantage. Not all forms of resistance are necessarily beneficial in the long run. Aihwa Ong, for example, notes that Malaysian women using spirit possession as resistance to exploitation may be releasing frustrations that could have gone into collective labor organizing. And as we noted, white supremacist groups might well be described as marginalized people who appropriate the internet and other technologies. While free speech must be preserved at all costs, appropriation is not making a better society in the case of neo-nazi web sites. \r\n\r\nThird, Insofar as science and technology appropriations do have potential contributions to stronger democracy (cf. Schuler 1996), we need to understand how these positive attributes can succeed. First, there are obstacles to appropriation on the design side; most obviously those created by totalitarian governments, but corporations can also dampen or discourage appropriation. The flexibility required to allow user adaptation, for example, is increasingly threatened in contemporary information technology marketing strategies. Encouraging designers to incorporate appropriation as a positive virtue means reversing this trend towards inflexibility. Second, there are obstacles to appropriation on the lay public side. We need to not only overcome the ideology barrier, but also the barriers of education and access to physical resources.', 'In terms of the designer barrier, we can train engineers and designers to think about approapriation as a positive goal. In terms of the ideology barrier, we can encourage marginalized groups to strive towards positive conceptions of hybridity rather than relying on notions of purity. And in terms of the resource barrier, we can encourage the creation of community technology centers, among other efforts. \r\n\r\nFinally, we should examine each case of lay/professional relationship in terms of the dependence or independence fostered by various appropriated technology strategies. A \"consumer ombudsman\" offers more independence than a marketing survey, participatory design offers more than the ombudsman, and appropriating technology offers a maximum of independance. But again this is not an ethical spectrum -- there are cases in which groups are better off with an ombudsman than an act of appropriation. Increasing independence can free up new possibilities, but decreasing it can facilitate institutionalization. Rather than romanticize independence, both users and designers should strive towards the lay/professional relationship that will move toward strong democracy in their particular context. In conclusion: we can encourage, inspire, and incite the use of appropriated technologies for opening new possibilities in the relations of culture and technoscience.', NULL, 495, 843, '2006-07-18 17:00:47', '2006-10-04 09:27:00', NULL, NULL, 'rpi', NULL, 306, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Africa, for example, is typically presented to the rest of the world &mdash; and to Africans as well &mdash;  by CNN and other western media &mdash; <em>not</em> by Africans or African media. This problem, of couse, is not confined to Africa. Poor people everywhere are portrayed &mdash; if they\'re portrayed at all &mdash; as nameless and voiceless, rarely as people with ideas,  aspirations, creativity, culture or values.', 'This pattern is applicable in any setting where information about one group of people is being developed and distributed by another group of people.', '<blockquote>\"More recently, in later modernity the theme of the everyday has been considerably more prominent.  But this does not mean that questions about who is representing for whom and why and how have been resolved. Issues about legitimacy of representation remain crucial, and indeed I shall argue that how  to articulate and represent the everyday is the main issue in the politics of culture.\" - David Chaney (2002)</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNon-whites, convicts, the poor, sick, starving people, flood victims, uneducated, aged, rural as well as intellectuals, dissidents, gender, ethnic and other marginalized groups are often the victim of mis-representation. Their presentations are often paper-thin, stereotypical at best. (While mention of other people are simply omitted; they don\'t exist.)  The net result is a compelling, free-floating image of \"normalcy\" that serves as a model to be emulated.\r\n\r\nThis pattern represents a concept that gets very little notice. After all, there is really no way to fully control your representation or what people do with it. Ultimately its an expression of power: Who is creating the representations, under what conditions, and how can they be maintained, changed, or challenged? When somebody else is determining how you will be represented you have been robbed of your right to defend yourself, to make your own case for who you are. On some level, it\'s a type of identity theft. Who you are has been determined elsewhere and stamped on you. \r\n\r\nWhy bother with representations? Is there really anything to worry about? Are there any negative implications? Yes. For one thing, there seems to be substantial evidence that people start believeing their own representations &mdash; and act according to them. Representations, unfortunately, can have exceedingly long life spans since culture tends to replicate itself. Also people individually see little reason to change the way they view the world unless there is a compelling reason to rethink themselves. \r\n\r\nThis pattern on the one hand depicts the need for people everywhere to grab hold of their own representation and challenge the mechanisms (generally of media production) that perpetuates the stereotypes. At this level of analysis the pattern recommends a more accurate and bi-directional approach to \"representation\" &mdash; often of entire countries, ethnic and other marginalized populations.  At a deeper level this pattern seeks to remedy a problem much more insidious -- that of a steady colonization from \"within.\" \r\n\r\nThe importance of this pattern is obvious. It\'s why people may be suspicious when others are talking about them. It\'s why big corporations and political parties spend enormous sums on <I>public relations</I> and \"spinning\" news and other information to their advantage. Corporations and government agencies have elaborate  and professional strategies for ensuring that their public portrait is painted according to their specifications. Movies stars, writers, etc. have their own publicists whose job it is to bring (or <i>push</i>) certain information to certain people. On the other hand, powerful people and institutions also go to great lengths to keep some information submerged and hidden forever. \r\n\r\nThere are several tools for addressing these problems. People in the group who may be perpetrating the stereotypes &mdash; white males (like me) for example &mdash; have the responsibility to acknowledge these transgressions and strive to overcome them. Media literacy and media critique are two skills worth developing and media monitoring is a worthwhile way to develop a fact base that can be used to confront the mis-representers. Much of this work should be done at a community level: the analyses should be shared, for example, with the community because it\'s often the community that is being mis-represented. Also, as was alluded to earlier, it may even be possible that members of the mis-represented community may be unconsciously living down to the stereotypes of their community. \r\n\r\nMedia is essentially a one-way street, a mute, wall-to-wall hallucinatory enclosure.  (Although people do interpret according to their own rules that the media doesn\'t necessarily control.) The \"message\" of this medium is rarely acknowledged &mdash; it is truly the fabled 800-pound gorilla.  Like a voice in your head, its message is compelling and persistent.  <I>It won\'t go away!</I> It sows indecision while removing individual autonomy and opportunities for authentic social learning. Yet media producers aren\'t necessarily evil.  Often laziness, lack of imagination (cloning the popular movie), and financial decisions factor in.', 'The first step to addressing  this problem is to acknowledge that it exists. Since the media (and cultural representations generally) are so ubiquitous that it\'s hard to believe that there is a bias, however implicit. The second obstacle is thinking that nothing can be done about this. As you dig deeper in this you may simultaneously be amazed at the extent of the problem and your desire to help overcome it.', NULL, 315, 489, '2006-10-30 15:01:10', '2006-10-30 14:40:11', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(319, 309, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'People outside the major spheres of power are often denied access to the tools and technologies of self-expression. This is often the unfortunate by-product of poverty; education is out reach of the majority of the majority of the world\'s population and access to media tools (including cameras, editing software, recording studios, the Internet) and other systems is often prohibitively expensive. Although this situation can be debilitating to people who are caught in those circumstances, the rest of society suffers as well: they are deprived of stories and perspectives that could enrich their understanding of the world while preparing them to become better citizens of the world &mdash; and their local community.', 'Anybody with a story to tell &mdash; and this includes everybody &mdash; could benefit from this pattern. This pattern, however, specifically addresses those people with little to no access to media production of any kind. Although this pattern focuses on the people who lack the access, implementation of this pattern often requires the assistance of people and organizations who have both the resources and interest in working with people in a participatory way.', 'The story told in the 2004 documentary \"Born into Brothels\" is an excellent example of this pattern. In 1997, New York-based photographer Zana Briski traveled to India to document the lives of women, children and men who lived in Calcutta\'s impoverished red light district. During the next three years, some of which was spent living in the brothels, Briski noticed that many of the children of the prostitutes were fascinated by her photographic equipment. Soon she started giving them cameras and helping them to use them as a new lens to look at their world. Later she organized shows at galleries for the photographs and made the photographs available on the Internet. The money from the sales is now being used to help support the children\'s education. While raising money for the worthy cause of education &mdash; and raising the consciousness of millions of others who watched the documentary &mdash; is exemplary, the most important outcome of the project may be the increased awareness and perception that seemed to be unlocked in the children by the acts of observing and recording their surroundings with the camera.\r\n\r\nWhile the Homemade Media pattern is not a panacea it does have many possible benefits. The first benefit is of course that learning to create media helps build skills and as such may lead to employment. Regardless of that, however, it helps build confidence and self-esteem. These positive attitudes about oneself and the desire to keep persisting in the craft of creating media &mdash; whether photography, interviews, audio recordings, or newspapers &mdash; is a good defense against self-destructive behaviors such as alcohol or other drug abuse or gang activity or criminal outlets. The act of capturing an image in a camera\'s viewfinder or writing down fragments of overheard conversations or otherwise <i>recording</i> promotes the idea of reflection upon various aspects of life or the imagination. \r\n\r\nMedia is inherently shareable in some way. Photographs can displayed for viewing in galleries, printed in magazine or hung on public walls. Videos can be shown on televisions or in theatres. These can be artistic, informational, or lead to social change in some way. In any case, however, they can be used to communicate with others. Homemade Media can open up channels of communication with people, as audience or as potential partners for additional collaboration. \r\n\r\nA few other examples can show a little more of the breadth of the pattern: Drawings of children in Darfur present the horror of genocide that is hard to shake off. Gumball Poetry (http://www.gumballpoetry.com/) allows people to buy a short poem from a gumball machine for 25 cents. One of the most remarkable projects, however, took place in Bogoto, Colombia. Film-maker Felipe Aljure developed the Rebeldes con Cauce project in which he worked with 140 young people with no filmmaking experience to help them learn how to make films (Dowmunt, 1988). Most of the students were from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. They studied film, developed outlines and created ten to fifteen minute films which were ultimately aired on Bogota\'s channel Canal Capital where they received \"outstanding\" ratings. \r\n\r\nThe Plugged In Project in East Palo Alto helped teach underprivileged youths how to create web pages that told their stories (while teaching them a skill, self-confidence, etc.) from celebrating Thanksgiving holiday with their family to witnessing the seizure of a family member by immigration officials for now have the appropriate papers to remain in the country. \r\n\r\nThe homeless newspaper movement is active in many cities around the world. Although it takes different forms in different cities, the basic model is the same: The newspaper concentrates on issues of homelessness and poverty, two subjects that are likely to be covered sensitively or in much depth by mainstream media. Beyond that the newspaper is often actively engaged in the struggle for the rights of poor people and engages poor people and their communities in every aspect of the newspaper production and distribution.  The Real Change weekly newspaper in Seattle is sold by people who are homeless or otherwise in underprivileged positions for $1.00 and receive 70 cents for each paper sold. \r\n\r\nSolution: The Homemade Media can be applied in a million ways.

Even when these problems are acknowledged, resistance to them is shallow, erratic, uncoordinated and ineffectual. Although art can be used to deliver a message of inspiration and information for the disempowered, it is often irrelevant; it can be a tool of the powerful and a diversion of the wealthy. In many cases, a distracting and ubiquitous corporate media has replaced the tradition of people and communities telling their own stories.', 'People and societies around the world have over the years developed their own versions of hell on earth that some subset of its inhabitants is obliged to endure. These regions exist within all societies, but vary in size and in magnitude of abuse ranging from neglect to active repression.', 'Artists occupy a unique role in society.  Through a diversity of approaches, they explore new terrains that words alone are incapable of describing. Art can address issues, help solve problems and even serve as a \"public psychiatrist\" that surfaces social anxieties.  Art speaks to places that other languages can\'t and affects consciousness on a level that we don\'t understand and can\'t map. Some, but not all, artists work for social and environmental justice. Notably artists can explore ideas of personal or societal importance or they can operate within a world circumscribed by religious authorities, corporations or the art-buying public, a decidedly privileged class economically. \r\n\r\nThe \"world\" that \"resistance\" strives to understand and confront provides an exhaustible fount of inspiration for artists &#150; professionals and non-professionals alike.  The media through which messages and stories can be conveyed includes T-shirts (indeed, wearing the wrong t-shirt is an invitation to harassment, fines, and imprisonment in my regions and countries around the world) and comics and zines, opera, ballet, graffiti, murals, sculpture, film, film or many other approaches.  Art can be immersive and engaging; it can help build community and involve the \"audience\" in rituals or processions. Art can be an invidual or collective effort, big or small, public or anonymous, clandestine and furtive,  In can be created by children or by people or emotionally disturbed. The art of homeless people, refugees, or incarcerated people is likely to present a view of the world that the rest of us may not see. \r\n\r\nResistance art brings hidden knowledge out of the shadows. The historic roots of contemporary experience, a common theme of Chicano murals, such as those created by Los Cybrids collective, in Los Angeles and other southwestern cities in the US explore themes of identity and hybridity. Another approach is to present the reality of a situation in a documentary style, such as Walker Evans\' sparse, unadorned depression era photographs of the rural poor. Another approach is exemplified by George Grosz\'s grotesque and piercing caricatures of militarists and war-profiteers, or Hitler garbed in a bearskin. \r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, Artists of the World Against Apartheid based in France issued a broad appeal to artists around the world to contribute anti-apartheid works of art. Ernest Pignon-Ernest of France and Antonio Saura of Spain worked unselfishly for two years to make it happen. A major exhibition was mounted in late 1983 at the Fondation Nationale des Arts Graphiques et Plastiques in Paris. Since the organizers had stipulated in advance that the art would be held in trust and given to the people of South Africa on the occasion of \"the first free and democratic government by universal suffrage\" as the basis of an anti-apartheid museum, the collection was moved to South Africa at the request of president Nelson Mandela.\r\n\r\nA similar event took place in the U.S. two decades later. With the invasion of Iraq looming, first lady Laura Bush, picked an inopportune time to invite poet Sam Hamill to a special White House event, \"Poetry and the American Voice,\" which was to celebrate the works of Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman and Langston Hughes. Instead of being seduced by to the allure of power and prestige, Hamill refused Bush\'s invitation.  Instead he emailed several friends asking them for poems on the theme of war which would be bound and presented to Bush. This ignited a poetic firestorm that claimed no national border. Inspired by Hamill\'s defiance, a web site (http://www.poetsagainstthewar.org) was established that provided a platform for poets around the world to express their feelings related to the impending war.  The site proved immediately and enormously popular &#150; at its peak it was averaging several new poems a minute.  Now the site has over 20,000 poems online &#150; including works by Adrienne Rich, W.S. Merwin. and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and spotlights several poems per week.  The project ultimately published two volumes of poetry and an excellent documentary film, \"Poets in Wartime,\" was inspired by the effort. Moreover, the work engendered a non-profit organization, \"Poets Against War\", was formed with the simple yet direct mission statement: \"Poets Against War continues the tradition of socially engaged poetry by creating venues for poetry as a voice against war, tyranny and oppression.\" \r\n\r\nThis episode (Poets Against War) raises the general question of the role of occupational groups and whether there is an implicit or explicit obligation to help deter aggression and war.  A short list of such candidates would include teachers, religious leaders, engineers, journalists, farmers, and doctors and nurses and other caregivers. A longer list would include almost everybody &#150; for very few people in the world actually want to be within war\'s lethal compass, as either participant or as innocent bystander. \r\n\r\nAnother fascinating example, is the beehive design collective, an amazing anarchic and itinerant design collective that, although home-based in Vermont, travels around the world to create region-specific murals. Members often work with indigenous or other people to develop murals that capture the unique circumstances of the people who live there. The murals they develop grow organically; containing a variety of elements sinuously weaving indigenous plans and animals, historic referents, and symbols of corporate and colonial domination, with images of fanciful and realistic resistance.\r\n\r\nResistance art has many audiences. In the anti-apartheid movement, for example, the audience would obviously include the victims of apartheid and the supporters of their struggle.  It would also include the people who believe themselves neutral of hadn\'t thought about apartheid from a moral standpoint and people who were actively promulgating it: politicians, policemen, the media, and business spokespeople who benefited from the cheap labor provided by the marginalized victims. Beyond that, the audience extended to the rest of the world.  Many people outside of South Africa worked on anti-apartheid campaigns.  Gill Scott-Heron\'s anti-apartheid anthem, \"Johannesburg,\" was played on the radio in US cities, where its uncomfortable references to big segregated cities in the US like New York and Philadelphia showed that South Africa was not the only country in the world where prejudice and racism flourished. \r\n\r\nFrom Goya and Picasso to Johannesburg\'s T-shirt artists of and anonymous graffiti artists around the world, resistance artists, generally acting  on their own &#150; have portrayed the horrors of war or other abominations. Activists in Seattle, hoping to help cultivate a supportive community network for resistance artists have convened an  <a href=\"http://www.artofresistance-seattle.net/\">Arts of Resistance conference</a> for the past two years.  Through workshops, presentations, videos, and, most importantly, through face-to-face dialogue and debate, the idea that art can be socially transformative became more widely recognized and more thoughtfully practiced. \r\n\r\nPeople ultimately also need to be reminded of two things &#150; that they are not impotent and disconnected spectators but active and engaged participants in the ongoing vibrant fabric of life. Art, therefore, can tell the story of the ongoing struggle while suggesting  ways for people to take part.  It can also sketch out, in possibly indistinct and uncertain terms, a future that may exist, after successful struggles, where children, and their children, and their children\'s children do not experience the daily injury of living in an unjust and unhealthy world. \r\n\r\nAnglican Bishop Desmond Tutu, a longtime foe of apartheid, notes that when resistance art is successful, \"People come to the forceful realization that they are not entirely the impotent playthings of powerful forces.\" According to Tutu, resistance art, whether it\'s a play, song or T-shirt represents, \"a proud defiance of the hostile forces that would demean and dehumanize.\"\r\n\r\nCurrent introductory image for this pattern can be found at http://www.robben-island.org.za/departments/heritage/mayibuye/images/art_against_1.jpg.', 'Art can convey beauty, love and joy. It can also convey justice, fairness, dignity and <i>resistance.</i> Engaging in art can hone creativity by encouraging exploration within a plastic medium.  The future itself is a plastic medium and we will never know how malleable it is if we don\'t explore it.

More than 23,000 U.S. workers are dismissed or punished each year for exercising their legal rights to form or join a union. \r\n\r\nTrade agreements like NAFTA and GATT further weaken worker power. While they strongly protect corporate intellectual property and investment, they open up nations to unfettered competition in terms of jobs and living standards. Even workers in high-tech fields like programming see their wages and job security battered by international outsourcing.\r\n\r\nUnions have historically helped workers overcome this competition by uniting them to win across-the-board justice for the majority. In the 1900s they won equal pay and benefits across whole industries like automobiles and steel. The challenge today is to overcome international competition and join hands to win good wages and conditions worldwide. \r\n\r\nThe challenge is daunting to say the least. The AFL-CIO split in 2005 when several big unions formed a new federation that pledged to organize more vigorously. This division, however, may also dilute the clout of labor to act in concert. Nonetheless, steps being taken today suggest ways we can move toward the vision of global worker justice and unionism, aided by fast, global Internet communications. These steps include:\r\n\r\n	Build broad support for workers and communities, regardless of location or whether there is a union contract, and apply pressure to encourage government support for workers.\r\n\r\nPeople can join AFL-CIO campaigns to support better laws and worker rights at workingamerica.org. The Jobs for Justice coalition also rallies public support for worker-justice battles. The campaign against Wal-Mart, one of the most powerful economic forces on earth, is proof that the movement can reach beyond its members. Wal-Mart paved the way for retailers to aggressively demand lower costs from producers around the world. The union movement is using the Internet to tap into a broad reservoir of resentment to these tactics, including small businesses and towns devastated by Wal-Mart super-stores, states fed up with covering health costs Wal-Mart should have paid for its own workers, and young people upset with the Wal-Mart-ization of culture and opportunities. Laws are being passed in Chicago and elsewhere to demand that major retailers pay good wages and benefits.\r\n\r\n	Connect with immigrants and workers across national borders to build permanent support networks and apply global pressure on companies and governments to respect workers. \r\n\r\nGiven the vast distances and differences in living standards, culture and language, as well as interference from repressive governments, reaching across borders is not easy. To succeed, unions must connect with other social movements and take maximum advantage of technology to communicate quickly and cheaply around the world.\r\n\r\n	Organize globally against corporate threats to play workers against each other.\r\n\r\nThe New York-based National Labor Committee exposes the appalling conditions in foreign sweatshops through creative media events that attract support from churches and the public. The Campaign for Labor Rights in the U.S., Britains LabourStart and the U.S.-based UE electrical workers union (which publishes a virtual newsletter on Mexican labor and is allied with a democratic Mexican union) also organize powerful email campaigns to support union struggles around the world, while groups like the Comité Fronterizo de Obreros organize on the ground across borders.\r\n\r\n	Challenge the commercialization of culture and inspire an ethical framework in which people are called upon to make sacrifices  such as not buying products made in sweatshops  to press for gains that benefit all.\r\n\r\nStudents are organizing to support labor rights locally and globally. The first group of Mexican workers to organize at a maquila clothing factory (i.e., a factory producing products for export under conditions favoring multinationals) was at the Korean-owned Mexmode factory in Puebla. A courageous strike by young women workers won a new union in 2001 through key support from the U.S.-based United Students against Sweatshops, which in turn is allied with labor and global anti-sweatshop groups. They quickly mobilized using the Internet. \r\n\r\n	Share technical ideas, information and organizing experiences with activists and labor supporters worldwide.\r\n\r\nAcademics have been sharing information globally on labor organizing, as evidenced at the Global Unions conference sponsored by Cornell in 2006. And union supporters from several nations meet biannually at LaborTech conferences to showcase creative uses of modern communications.\r\n\r\n	Push for trade agreements that protect not just corporate investment but workers rights, with trade penalties for mistreating workers. Insist on democratic input into international trade rules. \r\n\r\nSeveral Latin American governments have rejected the neo-liberal basis of modern trade agreements and the anti-worker conditions imposed by lending institutions. In 2006, a popular French revolt against watering down job protections for young workers won a surprise victory. Recent rounds of trade talks have failed, and Mexican voters turned out en masse for Lopez Obrador, who wants to renegotiate NAFTA. \r\n\r\nThe labor movement cannot and will not die. Workers are struggling for union rights around the globe -- even against the greatest of odds. And the public is increasingly supportive.', 'After decades of losing ground, unions and advocates of worker justice are striving to overcome the competition for jobs that pits worker against worker in a global race to the bottom. A vision of global progress, based on humane values, solidarity and local community, can motivate a union movement that transcends borders and involves all workers and allies.\r\n\r\nThe Wal-Mart campaign, the anti-sweatshop movement and international networking are evidence that unions, the public, foreign workers and academics are reaching out in new ways to form support networks to raise standards for all workers. And they are pressuring governments to reject the neo-liberal trade policies that disadvantage workers, and insist on trade rules that require justice for workers.', NULL, 736, 750, '2006-08-14 15:02:53', '2006-10-29 20:42:58', NULL, NULL, 'independent web designer and activist', NULL, 265, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The health of a community is sustained by these conversations and people who are blocked from this universe of conversations are, in a fundamental way, blocked from membership in the community. For that reason the integration of people into the broad community conversation network is important to all communities. \r\n\r\nVoice mail is a low-cost solution that substitutes for dial tone for those unable to afford it. Community Providing voice mail to a community of people cut off from the communications infrastructure is technologically plausible and works well in urban environments where there is existing infrastructure (telephone service, community providers, and pay telephones); however, the need for the service exists anywhere there are disconnected people. The audience of users runs the gamut from the homeless to the working poor to people fleeing domestic violence or dealing with health problems in need of a confidential communication link that is easy to access.', 'In 1991, two program directors at the Seattle Worker Center conceived of a small project that had an unpredictably potent impact. Called Community Voice Mail (CVM), the idea responded practically to a specific problem: How can a homeless person find work or housing, receive medical or social services, or navigate daily life without a reliable and direct point of contact? Furthermore, how can the job developer, the doctor, the advocate, in short, the social services system charged with the mission to respond to the needs of the poor and homeless, do so efficiently and effectively if they must devote hours to tracking down the individuals they serve?\r\n\r\nCommunity Voice Mail  responds to this need by acting like a home answering machine for thousands of people across a community. The CVM service is a shared resource operated by the CVM national office and a local community-based organization that takes on the role of host. This host builds a network of participating agencies to maximize the distribution of the resource cost-effectively. People in crisis and transition may enroll in CVM through any number of social, human, or health services agencies in the community. By providing multiple points of access, the service allows practical and flexible eligibility criteria while maintaining basic measurement standards.\r\n\r\nAs of 2008, the program operates in forty-one U.S. cities and in Melbourne, Australia, connecting more than 461,000 people annually. The CVM national office provides guidance on how to start a CVM service and supports the resulting federation of peer sites.  Cisco Systems is the majority funder of the nonprofit program and donated equipment and software for a centralized network that uses Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to manage accounts for tens of thousands of users. The networks advanced capabilities include a broadcast messaging feature that is used to distribute information about job openings, training opportunities, community resources, and emergency weather warnings to the voicemail subscribers.\r\n\r\nConnecting individuals via communication services integrates people into existing communication networks but, also, helps establish new networks. These networks could help support the community of people who use the system by allowing the users and the managers of the system to share relevant information and mobilize users in relation to specific issues and events. \r\n\r\nUniversal voice mail presents a meaningful pattern and objective that can assist communities by encouraging the integration of all people into the community. At the same time the employment of this pattern will necessarily take a wide variety of forms depending on many factors. These forms will be determined by the people who will use the services, organizations in the community that are providing the services, and the general nature and climate of social services in the community. Other things, including the technological infrastructure, social capital, and the ability to raise funds in the community, perhaps through an innovative commercial sector are relevant as well. The dedication of the organizers is also key, as is their ability to collaborate and incrementally improve the level of support over time. Since technological systems are still changing rapidly (although they are unevenly distributed, with the more technically sophisticated systems concentrated in economically privileged regions) the nature of the service needs  and the technological support that is needed to support the service  will undoubtedly change as well.', 'Universal voicemail should be available as a low-cost alternative to telephone service so that all people, regardless of income, have a reliable point of contact that maintains dignity and restores connection to opportunity and support.', NULL, 129, 844, '2006-10-24 05:41:44', '2008-10-22 13:32:07', NULL, NULL, 'Community Technology Institute', NULL, 170, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

How do they change as languages and cultures evolve through different communication technologies?  In the age of cyberspace we often feel alienated from genuine stories, ones that we live with every day, that tell us how to become decent human beings and live meaningful lives. Corporate media exploit story patterns that evolved to pass on ethical codes, and we are trapped into thinking about products instead of reflecting on our lives.  Traditional myths explored dynamic relationships between humans and nature. How can stories to help us adapt to our quickly changing world?', 'This pattern addresses the concerns of organizations and individuals involved in: Education, Culture, Arts, Society, Mythology, Technology, Law, Philosophy, Humanities, Psychology, Science, Environmental Studies, Religion, Social & Political Science, and Activism.', '<i>One way or another we are living the stories planted in us early or along the way, or we are also living the stories we plantedknowingly or unknowinglyin ourselves. We live stories that either give our lives meaning or negate it with meaninglessness.  If we change the stories we live by, quite possibly we change our lives. </i>   Ben Okri, Nigerian storyteller\r\n\r\nPatterns in stories tend to reflect the environments we live in and the communication media we use. Indigenous peoples evolved patterns in oral traditions that resonated with the voices of the land and reinforced memory and meaning.  The invention of writing and the phonetic alphabet played with the way language and images could be displayed as texts.  The advent of the printing press offered freedom to experiment with new narrative and poetic forms, as well as restraints, as texts and language became standardized. The structure of stories changed as they moved from the places they were told onto the printed page. \r\n\r\nToday, can words again become winged as they fly through both time and space in new forms offered by electronic media?  Speech is communal; it exists only as it is being shared.  As stories shift and change in response to new environments and technologies, who has access and jurisdiction to manipulate them? Can these new mediums offer opportunities to engage our senses and help us reconnect to the natural world?  Can this enriched experience help us reflect on the deeper messages that stories contain? \r\n\r\nStories are conduits or vehicles that mediate our inner and outer worlds.  When we tell stories, we are connected to live events and internal dramas.  Modern cultures utilize technology to record ideas or performances, and tend to value the analysis of texts, recordings, and other artifacts of expression.  We cultivate methods of reflection that reinforce our capacity to respond, think, and explore symbolic messages, but our objectivity makes us feel removed or alienated from authentic experience. We often yearn for the mystery of stories to deepen our lives.\r\n\r\nOral cultures are immersed in ritual and experience; the time, place, and context in which a story is told is crucial to its meaning.  Myths, which convey symbolic messages, are also repositories or living encyclopedias of practical knowledge and wisdom gained from sustainable relationships to the natural world.  Oral traditions resonate with mnemonic patterns, poetic rhythms, tones, and inflections of local landscapes. \r\n\r\nRichard Louve points out that studies of the songs of birds and whales reveal many of the same laws of composition as those used by humans. New scientific methods have enabled humans to learn about the intricate patterns of human and animal communication, but have not given most children a deep or genuine experience of animals and the stories or songs grounded in the natural world. This results in what Love describes as the modern childs hyper-intellectualized perception of nature and other animals.\r\n\r\nTechnology gives us tools to analyze and preserve traditional stories, but also disrupts and alienates people from meaningful stories that connect them with sustainable patterns in the natural world.  Modern myths are often caught up in the social, political, and economic systems that our new technologies have created. Those who control the stories, knowledge, and mediums of communication wield the power. \r\n\r\nMarsahll McLuhan explores the shadow side of technological and economic success by arguing that popular culture is a source for diagnosing the collective trance of industrial society.  Ads are a new kind of storytelling; a social ritual or magic that enhances us in our own eyes.  Rolf Jensen says, The highest-paid person in the first half of the next century will be the storyteller. Many global companies are mainly storytellers, and the value of products depends on the story they tell.  Advertisers proclaim freedom of choice as the foundation of the American way of life; however, they gloss over questions of power and control.  McLuhan suggests that individuals break the hypnotic trance of the media through tough-minded evaluation that probes the collective myths of our industrial folklore. \r\n\r\nMythologist Joseph Campbell says, not only have the old mythic notions of the nature of the cosmos gone to pieces, but also those of the origins of the history of mankind.  He suggests, that to give meaning to life, the modern person cannot simply reproduce inherited patterns of thought or action, but must create their own stories.  Since many people start with seeds provided by the media, how do they proceed?\r\n\r\nWords and stories are active agents. Ernest Cassirer says that the word, in early cosmologies, is the primary force from which being and doing originate.  Likewise, the cause and effect of media and print word magic in modern cultures determines our political and economic systems, and can result in nationalism and colonialism.  Traditional stories and myths that have evolved from oral, consensually shared standards and beliefs that value feeling and community interaction have come into conflict with technologies that value independence, analytical thought, and scientific or secular authority. Modern civilization is faced with a split between the head and the heart. \r\n\r\nIn the Greek myth of the phonetic alphabet, King Cadmus plants dragons\' teeth (alphabetic symbols) that rise up as armed men. If the alphabet could have such effects, what is the effect of modern technologies? We face the problem of how to deal ethically with the power humans have manufactured through technology. Can we recover a sense of reverence for the word without fueling tribal or national myths that sew dragons teeth?  \r\n\r\nThoreau anticipated these arguments in Walking, when he says, There are other letters for the child to learn than those which Cadmus invented.  Rather than learning letters in dusty schools, Thoreau wanted students to learn from wilderness.  For him, mythology came close to expressing the language of nature.  He advocates a kind of tawny grammar that celebrates what is wild and free.  Through this, he says, The highest that we can attain is not Knowledge, but Sympathy with Intelligence. \r\n\r\nPerhaps McLuhan suggests a solution to our dilemma when he says, two cultures or technologies can, like astronomical galaxies, pass through one another without collision; but not without change of configuration. Are we ready for a transformation of this magnitude? Can we connect traditional stories and myths with new technologies in ways that dont hypnotize us into a trance, but actually engage us more completely with community and the natural world?', 'Storytelling, an ancient art, needs to be rediscovered and updated.

It might also be useful for local or central government agencies intending to undertake positive action, with the help of purposeful and appropriate uses of ICT, in favor of social progress.', 'In order to overcome the limitations listed above, the idea that public facilities might be established within communities is now fairly commonplace around the world (Menou 2003). Modern public access points to ICT are often referred to as \"telecenters\" even though their origins, ownership, purposes and modes of operation are so diverse that the development of a typology of public access points might be justifed, so that the commonalities and differences might be understood (Menou & Stoll 2003b). \r\n\r\nTelecentres first emerged in Scandinavia and the UK during the 1980s and early 1990 and were known as telecottages, telehus, teleservice centers and electronic village Halls (Day, 1996 a&b) while the first \"Community Computer Center\" in the US was established in 1981 in the basement of a housing project in Harlem (New York City) (Schuler, 1996).  Intended to provide public access to computing technology, these initiatives were either run as community development projects, commercial ventures or a bit of both (Day, 2001; Day & Harris, 1997). In the so-called \"developing countries\" one might distinguish 3 main avenues that the development of telecenters took. Most publicized is \"pilot projects\" initiated by international development agencies such as UNESCO, World Bank, IDRC, USAID, etc., which resulted in the implantation of isolated facilities with limited involvment of the communities at the beginning, e.g. Timbuctu in Mali, Kothmale in Sri Lanka. Another line is government programs pretending to overcome the \"digital divide\" by the implantation of a large number of telecenters in \"undepriviledged\" communities (e.g. @Argentina) with the same drawbacks of a top down approach, no networking plus bureaucratic constraints. A third line combines individual initiatives by grass root NGOs in particular locales and a franchising model developed by the Red Cientifica Peruana in Peru, known as \"Cabinas Publicas Internet\" which entertained ambiguities between community service and small business development.\r\n\r\nToday the variety of public ICT access points (or PIAPs) and the nature of their roles is more wide-ranging and can be distinguished according to:\r\n\r\n- their origin, ranging from ad hoc initiative of an individual to national and international programs; \r\n- their purpose, ranging from profit of business owners - e.g. cyber or internet cafés - to free support to community development endeavors - e.g. true community telecenters; \r\n- their ownership, ranging from individual small entrepreneurs to community groups, local and central government entities;\r\n- the community participation in their governance, ranging from nil to full control;\r\n- the mix of ICT available, ranging from only one, e.g. public phone booths, to all (e.g. phone, fax, internet, radio, web TV, etc.);\r\n- the variety of services offered ranging from independant use of ICT to a wide mix of economic, social, educational and cultural activities;\r\n- whether they stand alone or are part of a more or less extensive network \r\n\r\nTrue community telecenters are part of the efforts undertaken by community members to build community and improve community conditions; they utilise ICT as a means, among others, that facilitate the attainment of these objectives (Menou & Stoll, 2003a). The centers are designed and managed with full participation of the community (Roessner 2005). Non- community telecenters are only concerned with providing access to ICT at an affordable cost to people who are deprived from it, whether temporarily or permanently. For the remainder of this pattern we focus exclusively on <em>community telecenters.</em>\r\n\r\nCommunity telecenters typically get started via two main avenues: \r\n\r\n1) They are the brain child of interested individuals or grass root community groups who champion their development and implementation through various community strategies and actions; or \r\n2) They form part of a top down (usually government or international agency) program purporting to bridge the \"digital divide\". \r\n \r\nTelecenters face a variety of problems and challenges that can be categorized as either social, political, economic, or technical.\r\n	\r\nIn the social realm the key issues are:\r\n\r\n- the relevance of the telecenter and ICT use as a means to support the various development efforts undertaken by the community\r\n- the appropriateness of its role, the social interaction it permits and the information it makes available, especially with regard to cultural and gender biases\r\n- the availability of people with required skills to operate and manage the telecenter and provide training and support to the users\r\n- the level of information and computer literacy in the community and the availability of intermediaries to offset their deficiency\r\n- the availability and accessibility of local information.\r\n	\r\nIn the political realm, key issues are:\r\n\r\n- the degree of ownership that the community might have from the inception, or progressively reach;\r\n- the level and continuity of community involvement in the management of the telecenter\r\n- the support of, or conversely conflict with, local and national authorities and pressure groups\r\n- the relationship with national programs in the area of universalization of telecommunications services and digital inclusion, and the ability of the telecenters to preserve their identity and autonomy though participating as appropriate in such programs;\r\n- the attitude of telecommunication companies vis a vis competition, universalization and digital inclusion efforts.\r\n	\r\nIn the economic realm, key issues are:\r\n\r\n- funding for initial investments\r\n- securing regular income streams that can can support the operation of the telecenter\r\n- securing resources for the maintenance and renewal of the equipment \r\n- offering employment conditions that are attractive enough for retaining the permanent staff \r\n\r\nIn the technological realm, key issues are: \r\n\r\n- reliability and cost of power supply\r\n- reliability and cost of telecommunications\r\n- reliability and cost of access to the international internet backbones\r\n- ability to implement a distributed network\r\n- capability of operating FOSS applications\r\n- capability of deploying media integration, in particular radio\r\n\r\nIn many countries central governments have funding programs to encourage the development of \"telecenters\". Significant financial backing from international organizations is also commonplace and support is also often available from local governements. \r\n\r\nTelecenter associations have been set up and  are seeking to establish their influence at the local level as well as forming broader groups at regional and international levels. These structures are powerful instruments for sharing knowledge and experiences, helping each other and consolidating the movement Menou, Delgadillo Poepsel & Stoll 2004). Such grass root organizations should not be confused with a number of top down portals and support schemes that pretend to represent telecenters and disseminate second hand knowledge for sake of specific political and commercial interests\r\n\r\nMirroring events from the 1980s & 90s when computers were parachuted into communities as part of top down development programmes, the current crop of telecentres face similar challenges of social, financial and technological sustainability. At that time telecottages and electronic village halls (EVHs) were very much flavor of the month among government and funding agencies (Day, 2001; Day & Harris, 1997). However, they were viewed as short-term project that were expected to achieve sustainability with no support or training. Some transformed themselves into small commercial ventures but most closed eventually leaving behind them a great deal of frustration and dissillusionment in the community. \r\n\r\nVery few lessons from that period appear to have be learnt. In the UK, the UK Online Centre programme, some 10 years or so after the initial telecottages and EVHs closed, many of the UK Online centres have closed or are closing after massive amounts of public funds had been pumped into them. Across the globe, the present tranche of telecenters seem to be following a very similar pattern of contradictory trends. On the one hand they are recognized by governments and international agencies as key instruments for achieving digital inclusion. Thus a proliferation of funding programs to support their establishment has been witnessed in recent years.  On the other hand the support currently being displayed has no long-term policy substance behind it and may not resist the medium term hazards of development endeavors. The pressure toward securing financial sustainability in the short-term - usually 3 to 4 years - may indeed push many telecenters to close or attempt to reinvent themselves as business enterprises wherever this is feasible despite the fact that by definition they serve a population which does not have a level of income sufficient for paying for non essential goods and services. Similar attempts in the UK and Scandinavia have historically proved fruitless and we hold out little hope for the future of most telecenters without significant changes being made to policy and funding strategies.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\nExamples\r\nAsodigua, Guatemala: <a href=\"http://www.asodigua.org\">http://www.asodigua.org</a> \r\nSAMPA.org, Brazil: <a href=\"http://www.sampa.org\">http://www.sampa.org</a>\r\nContainer Project, Jamaica: <a href=\"http://www.container-project.net\">http://www.container-project.net</a>', 'In the same way that public library services facilitated increased participation in society for the socially excluded through universal access to knowledge, so too can telecenters have a similar socially beneficial effect on citizenship in the network society by increasing access to and participation in information (content) creation, communication exchanges and knowledge sharing. However, history shows that treating community telecenters as short-term projects rather than part of the social infrastructure results in the long-term failure of these initiatives with community disillusionment and increased social exclusion ensuing. For telecenters to be effective instruments in bridging the digital divide and promoting social inclusion consideration of their policy, economic, technological and social sustainability is required. \r\n\r\nWe posit that a policy framework is required which establishes community telecenters as component parts of basic infrastructure supporting community life. Such policies should develop mechanisms that guarantee that appropriate levels of funding will be maintained to ensure long-term operations. In the network society, telecenters should be as much apart of our social infrastructures as public libraries, education, police services, etc. It is simply inappropriate to expect telecenters to function as instruments of social inclusion in the digital age by adopting business models from the commercial world. Similarly, the composition of the funding model that many telecenters are forced to live by is flawed. Relatively large sums of capital funding that support the purchase of equipment is made available but little or no long-term funding is obtainable for revenue functions such as equipment and network maintenance and renewal, on-going training, or the advocacy and awareness raising work that keeps telecenters at the hub of community activities and needs. Even in some of the most well intentioned cases a form of myopia exists, where ICT is concerned. Approaches that would not be accepted in other aspects of social life appear to the norm where technology is concerned. Simply throwing computers into local communities does not in itself address community need. If technology is to be both appropriate and effective it must form constituent parts of the toolbox that communities have for dealing with issues and problems. Telecenters must be grounded in the fabric of community life if they are to be socially sustainable. \r\n\r\nA pre-requisite for social sustainability is community engagement. This demands community people getting actively involved in shaping and running telecenters in some way. In all likelihood this will involve learning directly from the experience of community telecenters operating in conditions similar to their own, so social networking skills need to be developed. Social sustainability means identifying what contribution a telecenter might make to community development efforts and involving community groups in designing, implementing and developing the telecenter. Operation and management training for members is essential if telecenters are to prosper. Support and advice in identifying and acquiring appropriate funding sources is a necessity. Finally, local communities can assist themselves in these matters by electing public administrators and lawmakers who genuinely support community technology initiatives and who understand the significance of their role in the community environment.', NULL, 867, 782, '2006-12-11 10:31:27', '2006-11-24 04:58:03', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 365, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Creative thinking is a human activity essential for self-realization, and for providing sustainable solutions to the myriad problems of our ever more complex global society. Three main factors prevent Thinking Communities from developing: lack of suitable locations for \"semi-solitary\" deep thought, lack of affordable communications infrastructure for such communities to develop, and too many social, professional and financial constraints preventing people from breaking out regularly for a sufficient period of time.', 'This pattern supports creative individuals and small groups with a pressing need for finding the time and concentration to work on a major project, but who lack access to locations, and are inhibited by many personal constraints. The pattern helps them to connect with individuals and organizations interested in providing affordable thinking facilities, and then to design and build their Thinking Communities. These communities allow their members to concentrate deeply, while also to meet peers who are working on their own projects. This semi-solitary mix of deep thought and social interaction should significantly increase individual and societal creative thinking capacity.', 'Thinking, resulting in new knowledge, is an essential human activity. Most related community research has focused on knowledge management and knowledge construction communities, often in an organizational or educational setting. For example, a typical corporate knowledge management community acts as a custodian for a Knowledge Domain, nurturing the sharing and creation of practices and knowledge that is key to the achievement of both company and personal objectives (Von Krogh et al., 2001). Similarly, an educational knowledge building community is a group of learners committed to advancing the group\'s knowledge of some shared problem through collaboration knowledge (Chai and Khine, 2006). However, when shifting from such an institutional to a more individual-oriented type of knowledge community, not much is known. In such a community, not organizational goals but individual thinking requirements, preferences, strengths, and weaknesses predominate. The resulting communities have much more of an emergent nature, and can be realized in a wide variety of forms. Thinking Communities, even more so than other communities, cannot be fully designed in every detail. Instead, developers should provide the right conditions and just enough guidance for such communities to get started, then let them evolve (Preece, 2000). A Thinking Community pattern can help outline such conditions and guidelines, while leaving each community enough freedom to develop its own unique values, norms, structures, and processes. \r\n\r\nThinking Communities require the right physical locations for individuals to reflect deeply by themselves, while also being able to interact on their thoughts with peers. They need an electronic communications infrastructure to organize and coordinate their community and communicate between locations. Social, professional, and financial constraints need to be minimized. \r\n\r\nWith location, communication, and personal constraints satisfied, Thinking Communities should start to be established and grow. A great variety of communities, ranging from loosely connected, semi-solitary individuals to large groups intensely focusing on solving a joint problem, will develop. Thinking Communities could thus become catalysts of creative thinking processes urgently needed to deal with some of the many pressing problems facing our globalizing world.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\nThinking Communities can manifest themselves in numerous forms. Each of the dimensions identified in the pattern can have many possible values. The pattern acts as an analytical lens to help identify successful combinations of values, and possibly new types of Thinking Communities. To give some idea of the breadth and depth of Thinking Communities, here are some of many possible examples:\r\n\r\n- A researcher is totally overworked, overwhelmed by the continuous stress of teaching, the publication rat race, and projects. She decides to recharge by taking a two month sabbatical after a conference she attended on the other side of the world. Since semester is over, she can plan it in between two academic years. She looks up the country she is visiting in the ReCharge researchers community web site, and discovers a scenic location close to the conference site, in the middle of a National Park. They offer long-term accommodation, for low monthly rent rates. They also have Internet connections, provide meals, and have a common room where she can meet fellow researchers. After two months of deep thinking and discussions with colleagues who provide fresh angles on her research, since they are not in her field, she goes back home. She is full of fundamental, new ideas that will sustain her in the stressful years to come. \r\n\r\n- Many people are inspired by the ways of living and thinking of indigenous peoples. However, it is often hard to establish relationships with such communities. A First Nation, however, hosts a simple hostel with a limited number of rooms on its domain,  allowing thinkers to work on their projects, while inviting them for a selected set of meetings and activities with the local community. This offers visitors a low-intensity, non-intrusive opportunity to get a realistic sense of the values, problems, and strengths of these communities, much beyond the understanding provided by the usual, shallow touristic visit to a reservation arts center. Simultaneously, it offers these local communities an alternative source of income and access to a world of ideas and contacts provided by visitors sincerely interested in building bridges between cultures.\r\n\r\n- Two countries go to war. Enlightened individuals from both sides want to discuss their differences in order to stop the madness, but discussions on an open electronic forum dedicated to the conflict inevitably derail into emotional rants and diatribes. Meetings in either country obviously do not work for political and security reasons. Forum members from another country, which has managed to successfully negotiate a peace agreement between its feuding factions in the recent past, invite a number of the most reasonable discussants to come to a resort in their country. A private foundation, sponsoring the discussion forum, pays most of the travel expenses. In the resort, the discussants gather in a number of group sessions, but also get ample opportunity to break out, go for walks, and have one-on-one discussions. Their meetings are structured by electronic meeting room software. Although in the short time frame available they cannot reach agreement on a Roadmap to Peace, they do agree on the most important issues to be worked out. In a closed electronic forum, supported by the same software, they continue their discussions upon return to their respective countries. The bonding and face to face meetings in a peaceful environment have created the conditions to start building a Thinking Community across political borders.', 'A finely meshed, worldwide network needs to be created of affordable locations where people can concentrate and work on their individual creative projects, while simultaneously being able to meet up with peers working on their own acts of creation. The Web will provide the communications infrastructure to develop the concepts of Thinking Communities and match supply and demand of Thinking Locations.

People need places where they can feel at home and hang out for extended periods without the need to spend lots of money. Unfortunately there is a scarcity of what Ray Oldenburg calls \"great good places\" that are convenient and welcoming. In many regions of the world people have forgotten how to \"hang out\" with friends, a lost art that refreshes the spirit and &mdash; sometimes &mdash; leads to social action as well.', 'This pattern is applicable to any place where people live. Whether a community is rich or poor, it needs \"third places\" where people comfortably congregate.', '\"The right of free assembly is the most natural privilege of man.\"  Alexis de Tocqueville (1963)\r\n\r\nThis pattern makes the case that probably shouldn\'t even need to be made; that people <i>need</i> the physical  presence of others and that <i>virtual spaces</i> however important and vibrant they can be, have not made physical meeting places obsolete. \r\n\r\nAlthough situations are different in different locations, the fact remains that communities need what sociologist Ray Oldenburg calls a \"great good place\" or \"third\" place which is a physical location, more-or-less public place, where people can \"hang out\" and talk about whatever they need to talk about.  Unfortunately these locations are threatened in many places. Many factors can contribute to the decline in great good places. Some neighborhoods may be dangerour or have a mistrusting atmosphere. Some may be too economically disadvantaged to be able to afford a safe place with a roof overhead. Moreover in the era of television and the car, the art of spending time around people that might be strangers may be dying. Other locations may have such high rents that it becomes necessary to cycle customers quickly to increase the \"efficiency\" of the cafe.\r\n\r\nOldenburg discusses many instances of the role of the \"great good place\" in history. These include German beer gardens in the US in the early 1990s, Viennese coffee shopts, French cafe society and the like.  It also discusses the fascinating role of taverns etc. in the development of the journalism, the media, business practices, and social change &mdash; including the American revolution against the British. Oldenburg quotes Sam Warner (1968) who states that the informal tavern groups \"provided the underlying fabric of the town, and when the Revolution began made it possible to gather militia companies quickly, to form effective committees of correspondence and of inspection, and to organize and to manage mass town meetings.\"  \r\n\r\nBradie Derrenger makes the important point that the \"great good place\" might not always be a traditional coffee or donut shop.  From the seat that he takes every day while waiting for the ferry that takes him to work he can engage with people he sees every day and with those who may be crossing Puget Sound for the first time. And  if and when other people started congregating there it might just happen that others would also do so. \r\n\r\nInterestingly it may be the case that communities with more \"third places\" are more politically and economically active. Whether this is always the case, a \"third place\" often contributes to a community\'s \"social capital\" which, as Robert Putnam has shown generally provides a wide range of benefits, including economic.', 'Communities need to ensure that \"third places,\" which are neither the home nor the workplace exist where anybody in the community is free to go and stay for as long as they want.  These places can be cafes, plazas, community centers or simply places with chairs or benches.

Policy makers, media producers and community activists are faced with the challenge of presenting that information to the people who need it, in a form that is accessible and acceptable.', 'The concept of <em>Soap Operas for Social Change</em>, developed by Mexican television producer Miguel Sabido, deftly weaves health and other socially responsible information into traditional soap operas to raise consciousness without compromising the compelling everyday drama that the genre exemplifies. Although this type of soap opera (called <em>Telenovelas</em> in Latin America) is not in the majority, there are examples of its use throughout Latin America, Asia, and Africa. \r\n\r\nIn 1967, the Peruvian telenovela Simplemente Maria that chronicles twenty years in the life of a maid working through the travails of the day as a single mother preparing for a career as a fashion designer was launched. It was this show apparently that opened up the possibility of social messages intertwined with popular culture. According to Hanna Rosin whose New Yorker article, Life Lessons helped inform this pattern, Perus working-class women identified deeply with Maria; they saw her story less as a Cinderella fantasy then as a future that was possible for them, too. Thousands of maids wrote to the station to say that they were going back to school. \r\n\r\nThe hero or heroine of a \"Sabido soap\" is a transitional character in the drama, a \"fallible character who struggles to behave decently\" (Rosin, 2006). In fact, the most important aspect of the telenovela is the barrage of <em>giros</em> (twists of fate), trials and tribulations, that continually tests the protagonists perseverance. In China, the program Bai Xing, or Ordinary People in English, features Luye, an unmarried rural Chinese girl who has a baby and moves to the city. This perfectly ordinary story is filled with the the real-life drama that people routinely face but is rarely portrayed. In recent episodes Luye discovers that two of her acquaintances have AIDS, a subject that is generally not found on Chinese television. \r\n\r\nThe non-governmental organizations Population Communications International and Population Media Center has been involved in socially responsible soap operas for many years. The focus is on usually related to population issues although this frequently involves health, sustainable development and environmental issues as well. Both are involved in the development of television and radio shows as well as work in other media, media leadership issues, and communication strategy and theory as well. The PMC web site explains that, \"The advantage of using long-running, entertainment serial dramas include their huge audience appeal and the emotional bonds that are formed between the audience members and characters, which can lead to strongly positive influences of the characters on attitudes and behaviors by audience members.\" Sabido has developed a methodology that was informed by the integration of several key communication theories. \r\n\r\nIdeally the social messages in the soap operas and telenovelas are presented in the form of <em>choices</em> that can be <em>consciously</em> made  not injunctions or instructions which must be obeyed. The best of these soap operas are probably more like this although the protagonist ultimately will make a choice and that choice is likely to be the one favored by the producers of the program. For many reasons, everybody who is involved in formulating a response to a given situation would be party to the dilemma played out on the television screen and weigh all the relevant factors individually and collectively. In Nepal, for example, the mother-in-law and husband are key players in decisions involving childbirth and must therefore be part of any approach to offer new choices for life decisions. Because soap operas in developing countries are shown in prime time (rather than during the day as, for example, in the U.S.) and are, therefore, seen by people across the spectrum of the population and because a high percentage of the viewers, are illiterate or are otherwise unable to gain access to relevant information, Socially Responsible Soap Operas make ideal vehicles for the propagation of useful information on such topics as family planning, domestic violence, nutrition, home management and emergency preparedness. \r\n\r\nSocially Responsible Soap Operas are clearly subject to challenges from many sources. In Burma, for example, the radio show Thaby e gone Ywa (Eugenia Tree Village) was broadcast illegally over shortwave radio because Burmas military dictatorship declared the program illegal. In the examples discussed above the creators of the programs are aware of the dangers of using the media for propaganda. As William Ryerson, president of PMC, explains, \"Unlike brainwashing, PMCs approach is to show a range of optionsto broaden rather than to narrow the perspective of the viewing audience with regard to the choices available to them. For each of the options, the programs show realistic consequences.\" \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the desire to fiddle with the content of popular shows could prove irresistible to overzealous governments that were intent in spreading their messages. Put in this context the practice of inserting message into soaps seems positively Orwellian. Yet commercial message are increasingly commonplace and product placements in Hollywood films, television shows, and, even books, while the society at least seems unfazed. Recently in the U.S. a spot in a book for teenager girls was sold to the highest bidder, a glossy lips makeup manufacturer. Also, of course, subtle and not-so-subtle messages thoroughly permeate much of the mass media, some of which is explicitly designed (for mass appeal, government appeasement, or as an expression of personal ideology) while others are unconsciously added to the mix, the atmosphere of commercialization is seemingly too ubiquitous to be resisted. \r\n\r\nAlthough many of the people who are likely to get involved in this pattern are policy-makers or media producers, other people can help promote this idea by entering into a dialogue with people who are better positioned to make changes. Although strong challenges exist, this pattern has rich potential  as a tool for positive social change.', 'Information about family planning and other important life decisions can be integrated into soap operas in ways that strengthen the dramatic impact of the show while leading to beneficial social effects at the same time.', NULL, 726, 618, '2006-10-16 20:19:09', '2006-10-06 09:54:58', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The program trains neighborhood teams and sponsors functional drills to rehearse roles and responsibilities.. \r\n\r\nIn terms of advocating for improved communications systems and facilities, the World Dialogue on Regulation for Network Economies has compiled a special dossier on the role of regulators and policymakers in ensuring that adequate emergency communications are available.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate aftermath of a disaster, the delivery of food, shelter and medical care can be hours, days, even weeks away. Tasks that must be handled by the stricken residents, as outlined and assigned to teams under the SDART model, include damage assessment, first aid, safety & security, light search & rescue, and providing sheltering & special needs. Communications responsibilities include monitoring emergency radio broadcasts, keeping neighbors informed of relevant information, relaying information about damage via amateur radio operators, satellite radio, cell phones, signs, or whatever means are available.\r\n\r\nIn the longer period of reconstruction following a disaster, when additional external resources can be brought into play, it is vitally important to ensure close coordination.\r\nThe very young and very old, as well as the poor face the greatest risk, in the short and long-term aftermath of catastrophe, often related to the worsening of already existing conditions of poor health and nutrition and inadequate housing. \r\n\r\nUNICEF studies of groups hit by warfare and famine show it is critical to provide the correct mix and balance of relief services and providing not only food but public health assistance to prevent massive outbreaks of infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nCivil society is capable of organizing large-scale efforts in the wake of disasters as demonstrated by the Katrina PeopleFinder Project and the Southeast Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog SEA-EAT blog associated with the East Asian tsunami.

This diversity can be a source of strength within communities, but it can also lead to frustration, disappointment, conflict, and even violence.  Diverse institutions have been created to address community challenges, including public libraries, public schooling, procedures for democratic governance, and venues for free expression.  Often, however, these institutions are reduced from their idealized conception.  With community inquiry, diversity becomes a resource and institutions are knit together productively.', 'As Jane Addams pointed out in founding Chicagos Hull-House, the first settlement house in the U.S. (Addams, 1912), and Dewey examined through the creation of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, democracy has been more realized in its political than its social expression. That is, even when formal procedures are established and maintained, meaningful participation is by no means guaranteed. For example, a public library might offer a large collection of books available at no charge to members of the community, but meaningful use of those materials depends also on available public transportation, broad-scale development of literacy skills, and a social organization that makes people feel welcome.  In this and many other examples, it is clear that the problem goes beyond institutions, structures, and procedures, requiring instead the means by which every member of the community comes into the process of authority.\r\n\r\nCommunity inquiry provides a theoretical and action framework for people to come together to develop shared capacity and work on common problems in an experimental and critical manner. \r\nThe word community signals support for collaborative activity and for creating knowledge that is connected to people\'s values, history, and lived experiences. Inquiry points to support for open-ended, democratic, participatory engagement. \r\n\r\nConsider the case of East St. Louis.  Its widely noted dissolution and destruction (Kozol, 1991) resulted from many factors, both internal and external.  The integration of housing in neighboring cities had the perverse effect of East St. Louis losing most of its middle class and professional workers.  Racism, both within and towards the city, was a key factor that led to its failure to get the resources it needed to maintain a vibrant community.  Problems compounded as elements within the city began to pull in different directions, often serving their own ends at the expense of the larger community.  For example, companies dumped hazardous waste and landlords allowed buildings to become dilapidated and dangerous.  From a community inquiry perspective, East St. Louis exhibited a failure for democratic, participatory engagement and demonstrated little evidence of people within the city or larger entitiesstate and nationalcoming together with shared values and goals. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, East St. Louis has survived and in some aspects has developed the capacity to thrive.  Community members have come together to address the severe problems they faced.  Substantial assets, such as the talent and dedication of Katherine Dunham, have taken enduring form in her museums and international dance workshops for children (http://www.eslarp.uiuc.edu/kdunham/).  The community collaborates with other organizations, such the University of Illinois; their joint East St. Louis Action Research Project (http://www.eslarp.uiuc.edu) has helped improve conditions in the city by setting up, for example, community technology centers, new housing, a light rail station, and a youth-driven community theater.  At the same time, ESLARP has provided new opportunities for university students, staff, and faculty who have worked in the community.  \r\n\r\nA key element of the work in East St. Louis is that it reflects continuing inquiry by people who are invested in the community in a variety of ways.  That is, successes to date have not come from outsiders dictating and delivering solutions, but by bringing together participants from diverse perspectives to work together.  Moreover, this work, while it addresses very practical problems of jobs, environment, health, education, cultural preservation and enrichment, and so forth, does not stop there.  Instead, local action becomes a means through which the residents and those outside learn more about the community and its possibilities.  In that sense, inquiry is both action and understanding. The lesson from East St. Louis, and similar communities, is that the process of community inquiry is ultimately of greater importance than the solving a specific problem.\r\n\r\nWe see many additional examples around the world of the power of community inquiry.  In the domain of community development and learning, for example, a National Science Foundation study carried out in rural villages around Bangladesh related the finding that material from well-worn saris supplied a filtering material that worked better in reducing cholera than the nylon mesh that microbiologists had developed (Recer, 2003).  In Reggio Emilia, Italy, with few of the resources found in affluent and advanced communities, families and teachers developed an innovative approach to education, now heralded throughout the world, that recognizes the potential of all children to learn and grow in relation with others, through the hundred languages of doing, being, reflecting, and knowing (http://www.reggioalliance.org). Community inquiry can also be manifested in the development of information and communication technology.  See, for example, the culturally situated design tools developed collaboratively between Renssalear Polytechnic Institute and its community partners (http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/csdt.html) and the Community Inquiry Laboratory software created collectively by the University of Illinois and its partners around the world, who come from all walks of life (http://ilabs.inquiry.uiuc.edu).', 'Therefore: When a community faces some problem, think of it not simply as something to be fixed but rather as an opportunity for the community to come together, to build capacity, and to learn about itself and its situation in a manner that can be joyful and intellectually stimulating.  Recognize that every member of the community has knowledge that may be critical to solving that problem but can be discovered only if that individual has a voice and a say in what the community does.  Recognize also that most problems are not solvable in one step and even when they are, may recur in the future.  Thus, it is critical for the community to not only fix its problems but to become an organism capable of further inquiry.  The communitys knowledge about how to deal with challenges is not in fixed procedures but rather in the capacity to learn through ongoing action, or what Dewey called experimental knowing.  \r\n\r\nWe have created a diagram to represent this cycle of ongoing community inquiry (see below): a spiral of asking questions, investigating solutions, creating new knowledge as we gather information, discussing our discoveries and experiences, and reflecting on our new-found understanding.', NULL, 636, 621, '2006-06-19 14:39:51', '2006-10-04 09:39:59', 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', NULL, 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', NULL, 343, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Although \"legitimate\" or mainstream theater has traditionally been a gathering place for the exchange of ideas, it is largely irrelevant in today\'s world as a tool for social change.  Forces which have contributed to this situation include economic factors, dwindling audiences, the talent drain to other mediums, the transformation of audience tastes and expectations as a result of film and television, and the decline of the avant-garde as alternative to legitimate theatre.', 'Illegitimate Theater can be \"legimitate\" response in almost any setting of ordinary &mdash; and extraordinary &mdash; life.  It can be practiced in any place where an \"audience\" might be found.', '\"Legitimate theater\" engages a paying audience sitting inside a theater with the expectation that they will watch the performance of a play or musical. These productions employ conventions normally associated with traditional theater: lights up and down, applause at the end of acts, a proscenium stage, professional actors working with prepared scripts, no significant interaction between performers and spectators.  \r\n\r\nLess than 2 percent of the population in the United States attends legitimate theater performances.\r\n\r\nWhile legitimate theater has lost much of its relevance to our everyday lives, theater (or <I>performance</I>) in the broad sense is a fundamental human experience. As such it represents a reservoir of immense potential that a mediated experience can rarely provide: the potential for human interaction.  Film and video provide a stream of images to watch, but no experiences in which the viewer can actually participate. Everyday life is often a sequence of ordinary, that is expected, events. One\'s life experiences easily become insulated from important world events &mdash; and the possibility of learning from new experiences as well. Ordinariness becomes a form of oppression and a steady dumbing down of society is deleterious to culture and to democracy as well. Performance provides an immediate human experience. Theater &mdash; particularly its \"illegitimate\" varieties &mdash; can also punctuate the ordinary and thrust new and unexpected experiences into everyday life. It has the power to bring a person into new, temporary realities in which the self is momentarily forgotten and submerged. Theater can empower the spectator with insight and possibilities. \r\n\r\nBaz Kershaw in his insightful study of the British <i>Alternative Theatre Movement</i> over four decades explicitly addresses the role of theater as an instrument of \"cultural intervention.\" His book (1992) \"is about the ways in which theater practitioners have tried to change not just the future action of their audiences, but also the structure of the audience\'s community and the nature of the audience\'s culture.\" This pattern affirms Kershaw\'s observation: New theater should accompany a new society. \r\n\r\nOther phrases &mdash such as Theater Without Theater, Anti-Theater, Meta-Theater, The World\'s a Stage, Social Performance, Guerilla Theater, or Oppositional (or Radical or Provocative) Theater &mdash are variations on the title of this pattern. Each of these alternative formulations focuses on some attributes and not on others. We use the term \"Illegitimate Theater\" primarily to highlight the differences between it and <I>legitimate</I> theater. Illegitimate theater can describe any performances in which one or more conventions of the legitimate theater are circumvented. For example, the convention of a single, discrete performance can be ignored in illegitimate theater. Thus, a \"one-two punch\" can be delivered, possibly anonymously: Half of the cast can \"perform\" &mdash; in Starbucks, at the zoo, or, even, a traditional theatrical venue &mdash; while the other half of the cast can \"accidentally\" encounter the audience afterwards and engage with them a second time, perhaps in dialogue, perhaps again as spectators, perhaps as actor / participants in a new performance that builds on ideas of the original one. The French group Le Grand Magic Circus devised a performance which gradually added the spectators (while withdrawing their members) at the \"end\"  of their performance until finally the spectators were the only ones left \"performing\" (Bennett,  1990).\r\n\r\nPerformance is an extremely broad term that characterizes an infinite number of situations including sports, rituals, education, carnivals, politics and protest.  It can encompass everyday social events such as shopping, eating in restaurants, going to parties or hanging out. Performance can be spontaneous or planned, obviously \"staged\" or masquerading as \"real life,\" artistic, political, cultural. The advent of performance studies as an academic discipline which transcends the traditional notion of <i>the</i> theater has contributed to our understanding of these myriad forms. \r\n\r\nBertolt Brecht, the most influential artist/advocate of theater for social change, rejected Aristotelian drama (the basis of Legitimate Theater) in favor of the Epic or Dialectical Theater. His theories and plays, such as <i>Three Penny Opera\"</i> and <i>Mother Courage</i>, blur the line between real life and performance, reveal the mechanics of production, present actor and character simultaneously, and employ a wide range of techniques designed to rouse the audience to social action. The venerable San Francisco Mime Troupe with performances such as <i>Fact Wino vs. Armagoddonman,</i> <i>Damaged Care,</i> and <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Obscuristan</i>, is a more recent incarnation of Brechtian rebellion. Augusto Boal from Brazil, a Workers\' Party (PT) activist, pioneered \"Theater of the Oppressed\" and other forms of participatory role-playing theater that has helped audiences to explore and recognize their own predicaments while fostering cooperation and critical engagement. \r\n\r\nMany public protests, especially those that include role playing, dramatic encounters, or masks, puppets and other props can be viewed as a type of performance. When Greenpeace\'s sailing ship \"Rainbow Warrior\" confronts a nuclear submarine or whaling ship, two symbolic worlds collide. Crosses symbolizing those killed in Iraq spring up in Crawford, Texas near the ranch of U.S. President George Bush; Argentine mothers and grandmothers clothed in mourning black stand before the president\'s Casa Rosa in Buenos Aires. More recently social activists employing techniques of <i>illegitimate</i> theater, have emerged to confront corporate globalization. These include the marching bands and giant puppets in the 1999 protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle, Reverend Billy from the Church of Not Shopping who orchestrates chain store \"interventions\" to \"unlock the hypnotic power of transnational capital\" and the \"Yes Men\" who have \"played the roles\" (as they satirically interpreted them) of various corporate and organizational officials to unsuspecting audiences around the world. \r\n\r\nAs Clifford Geertz would say &mdash; and Shakespeare before him &mdash; the world is truly a stage and everything we do in public is a type of performance. This of course means in a trivial sense that everyday life provides a venue for exhibition and self-promotion. The media exploits people\'s desire for \"fame\" (or publicity &mdash; the desire to be made publicly recognizable) and exhibits the ones it considers off-beat enough for public display, in the modern day equivalent of a freak show. \r\n\r\nMedia is more easily commodified when it assumes rigid forms. When a \"package\" exists, it\'s relatively easy &mdash; and cost-effective &mdash; to replicate it again and again with little effort or creativity. And when commercial broadcast media defines what is \"legitimate\", the imagination of the people decays, their capacity to create is harder to draw upon, their tolerance for experimentation and \"amateurism\" diminishes. \r\n\r\nIllegitimate Theater, like other patterns in this language, has unsavory manifestations as well: burning a cross in the yard of an African-American or other ethnic minority, militaristic parades and rallies, public intimidates.  Since \"performance\" likely predates language, its effects on people can be deep; it can unlock hate as well as love, anger as well as reason and compassion. Theater, whether legitimate or not, can be driven by emotion and therefore less analytic than many other patterns in this language. \r\n\r\nIllegitimate Theater blurs or even negates the line between spectators and performers. In its extreme version everybody, all the time, is an <i>actor.</i> And \"actors\" in public performances can also be \"actors\" in social life, actors who help make things happen &mdash; for good or for ill. Although our life \"in public\" is a series of performances, our roles are often construed as \"bit parts.\" But every moment is a \"teachable moment;\" every public appearance is an opportunity to do something new and to experience something new. Thus anybody, at least in theory, can practice the craft of illegitimate theater. The \"performances\" that come from this practice can be simple or elaborate, impromptu or painstakingly rehearsed. The point is to cause ripples in the everyday stream of life. \r\n\r\nIllegitimate theater, like is predecessors \"legitimate\" or otherwise, can be used to provoke emotional reactions, discussion or reflection. Practiced successfully and in a great number of venues, illegitimate theater could help foster positive social change and increased democratization of culture.', 'Illegitimate theater represents a intriguing set of possibilities for interactions between people that can  lead to social change.

The manufacture (and ultimate retirement) of all of these <i>things</i> is often accompanied with environmental damage, as the 23 \"Superfund\" sites in Silicon Valley will attest, In 2005, 63 million computers in the U.S. were replaced with newer models. Up to 80% of the waste is then sent to developing countries where it often contributes to environmental and health hazards. Additionally, energy is consumed &mdash; often in immense quantities &mdash; throughout every stage in the life-cycle of a product. As devices are made with shorter and shorter life-spans and the uses of ICS increases worldwide, this problem will become more critical unless something is done.', 'Vast numbers of people are affected by the increasing \"informatization\" of the world. This includes people who are fortunate enough to capitalize on the new technology and those who are unfortunate enough to live with the refuse. This pattern can be used by people who have some control over the situation, including those who are in a position to develop laws and policies, producers who can lessen the effects of their products entering the waste-stream, and local communities who can develop policies and programs for responsible treatment of discarded technology. Community activists, health professionals, local governments, and neighborhood organizations will need to organize and work together in this effort. Other possible participants include computer geeks, social activists, environmental activists and those wanting to learn more about computers and new technology.', 'The use of information and communication systems is expanding enormously in countries like the US as well as in countries like China and India. This is causing immense demands on their infrastructure and on the environment. Computer technology has grown increasingly more sophisticated in a very short period of time.  During that same time, the costs have dropped in relative and absolute terms, thus resulting in a massive number of obsolete computers and other technology much of which has been dumped somewhere where toxins like lead, cadmium and mercury can leach into the soil and water. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the new intellectual and social spaces that the new technology helps provide, we need to think about the impact that information and communication systems are having on the environment. Although we associate physical spaces like libraries and auditoriums with energy and resource use, the creation, storage, and distribution of information requires energy and resource use as well. Some of this use doesn\'t square with conventional wisdom. Computer use, for example was supposed to lower the consumption of paper because everybody would simply read the computer screen. The amount of travel was also going to decline because business could be conducted electronically, thus substituting communication for transportation. The electronics industry was also celebrated as an environmentally friendly industry yet there are 19 \"superfund\" sites associated with high-tech industries slated for environmental remediation in Santa Clara county, home to more of these sites that any other county in the U.S. IBM and Fairchild Electronics were disposing their waste products in underground tanks which subsequently leaked trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, Freon and other solvents into the drinking water of 65,000 people. There also seems to be an unhealthy link between the waste producers and the people who must deal with it, specifically prison inmates who work with inadequate protection and no health insurance working in <i>for profit</i> prisons. \r\n\r\nWhy pick on information and communication systems? After all, other sectors use energy and cause pollution. One reason is that \"electronic waste is the fastest growing part of the waster system,\" according to the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition.  Another reason is that it\'s important for people to realize that information and communication technology is <I>not</I> a utopian, magical answer to all problems. Obviously we need to consider the entire life-cycle of all products &mdash; including those related to information and communication. (While this task is not trivial, thinking about the \"second order\" effects while extremely important, is even more difficult to do meaningfully. The effects of the automobile on all aspects of life, including attitudes on sex, as well as the effects of the size of the weapons industry in the U.S. on foreign policy are both intriguing examples of unforeseen side-effects.) Understanding the entire \"cradle-to-grave\" (and <I>beyond!</I> as in the case of toxins that can reach out from the grave to poison air and water) is critical, but what should be done with the information? It may be easiest to require that every manufactured or imported product is covered under an ecologically-sound \"Take-it-Back\" (SVTC, 2005) policy that requires the manufacturer or importer to pay for recovery or safe sequestering of hazardous materials. \r\n\r\nFree Geek was started in Portland, Oregon in 2000 by members of the open source software community to bring resources to bear on the problems of e-waste and the digital divide by helping \"the needy get nerdy.\" The Free Geek approach combines participatory education and environmentalism. Free Geek addresses the problem of discarded computers and other electronic e-waste can be diminished by reusing and recycling. Free Geek uses volunteer labor to give new life to discarded technology. Volunteers are eligible to receive a computer after finishing a tour of service which educates the volunteer about computers and about the environmental impacts of ICT. The city government in Portland, as part of their effort to reduce e-waste helps support the project. A broad range of people are working together to cross the economic and social divides by working towards a common goal. The Free Geek concept has quickly spread to other areas including Washington, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois. \r\n\r\nThe Free Geek approach is not the only way to address the problem of lacking a community recycling program. There are many similar projects throughout the country that may or may not use open source software. But Free Geek is worth mentioning here for many reasons. First, Free Geek was developed by civil society; second, Free Geek is a partnership between several sectors and thus helps bring all sectors of the local community into a common struggle; and, third, Free Geek is an innovative approach that deftly addresses a multitude of issues within a common set of principles, assumptions and actions.  \r\n\r\nStarting and running a Free Geek or similar program requires a variety of skills and activities. The pattern can only be implemented by a group of people. To start that group one would post meeting announcements and invite members from local Linux users groups, college students and others. Since the overall environment for this approach will vary from community to community it\'s important to find out what\'s happening in your community and who\'s involved. The success of the project is likely to depend on how well you understand your community and can work with people in the community.  Beyond that, there are many \"nuts and bolts\" issues including finding space and funding and developing programs. Associating with Free Geek is probably a good idea because of its network of dedicated people, useful documents and software for running an community recycling project. \r\n\r\nThe environmental problems associated with information and communication technology are severe and no mutually agreed-upon long-term, sustainable solution has been identified. People are developing a variety of creative and thoughtful responses to the problems of ICT-related pollution but more  are needed. Information and communication technology can probably be part of the solution &mdash; but part of this involves stopping be part of the problem.', 'As a necessary part of stewardship and responsibility, it\'s essential to come to terms with the environmental impact of information and communication systems and devise suitable strategies towards minimizing their negative effects. Some combination of policy, consumer education, habits of consumption, social and technological innovation and recycling will probably be necessary for this take place effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"-1\" color=\"#303030\">Introductory graphic located at <a href=\"http://freegeek.org/volunteer.php\">http://freegeek.org/volunteer.php</a></font>', NULL, 561, 847, '2006-11-19 18:07:47', '2006-11-16 18:05:11', 'Free Geek Olympia', NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The motivation, however, of the groups providing search engines is securing profits for their owners; other motives necessarily and inevitably take a back seat. The negative implications of relying solely on commercial search engines, though vast, are generally not recognized. If the enormous gatekeeping potential of commercial search engines is not balanced with open and accountable public approaches, the ability to find non-commercial information including that which doesn\'t appeal to broad audiences or is critical of governments and other powerful institutions could conceivably disappear. The privatization of the means to access information could also lead to a situation where advertisements and other \"sponsored\" information could crowd out non-commercial information.', 'People in their daily lives need, search for &mdash; and find &mdash; a tremendous amount of information. Increasingly, they are looking for this information in cyberspace. While Internet technology has opened up an unbelievably vast amount of information and opportunities for communication for millions of people worldwide, the very fact that we are relying on technology which is out of our control is cause for concern &mdash; if not alarm. Although the application of this pattern is relevant to any system that people use to find information, our immediate attention is drawn to the Interne which is poised to become increasingly dominant in the years ahead.', 'Access to information can be made easier; barriers to obtaining the information that people need can, at least in theory, be anticipated and circumvented. But, like the chain whose ultimate strength is determined by its weakest link, access to information can be thwarted at many levels. Although non-public (commercial and otherwise) providers of information and communication services can be \"good citizens\" who prioritize the needs of their users, the temptation to become less civil may prove irresistible if and when the \"market\" suggests that uncivic behavior would result in higher revenue. In circumstances such as those, they may decide to relax their current high standards accordingly. Big web portals are, for example, becoming increasingly cooperative with the Chinese government, presumably because of the huge market which potentially exists there. \r\n\r\nOne approach to addressing this problem, an open source / public domain classification system similar to that used in the public libraries in the U.S. and other places coupled with open source, community owned and operated search engines, is simultaneously defensive and forward looking. Defensive, because it could serve as a hedge against information deprivation and commodification. Forward looking, because this approach could help usher in an exciting new wave of experimentation in the era of access to information. As the development of the Internet itself has demonstrated, the \"open source\" nature can help motivate and spur usage in terms of the complementary tasks of classifying information and retrieving it easily. \r\n\r\nExisting classification approaches like the Dewey Decimal System also have limitations (Anglo-centrism, for example) and approaches like Dewey are not strictly speaking in the public domain (although Dewey is readily licensable). Nevertheless the Dewey system might serve as at least a partial model. Schemes that are well-known, such as the Dewey Decimal system allow everybody to communicate more quickly and with less cost. It is the open protocol nature of the Internet that has allowed and promoted easy and inexpensive ways to not only get connected, but to develop new applications that relied on the underlying, no license fee, protocols. \r\n\r\nComputing and the potentially ubiquitous availability of online environments provide intriguing possibilities that older approaches didn\'t need or anticipate. The Dewey Decimal system, for example, tacitly assumes a physical arrangement of books &mdash; the code assigned by the librarian or technicians using the system declares both the book\'s classification and the location it will occupy in the library. Although having a <i>single value</i> is not without advantages, an online environment opens the door for multiple tags for a single web page &mdash; or for finer-grained elements (a paragraph, for example, on a web page or the results of a database query) or, broader-grained <i>collections</i> of elements. A federated collection of link servers (Poltrock and Schuler, 1995) could assist in this. \r\n\r\nAs far as search engines are concerned, civil society can hardly be expected to compete with Google\'s deep pockets and its acres of server farms. Yet, it may be possible to distribute expertise, knowledge, and computational capacity in such a way that a competitive \"People\'s Google\" (\"Poogle?) becomes conceivable. The idea of a single organization within civil society that can even remotely approach Google\'s phenomenal computing resources is of course absurd. But so in general is the idea of civil society \"taming\" the most powerful and entrenched forces and institutions. The problem here, though chiefly technological, is very similar to the one that civil society faces every day: How can a large number of people sharing similar (though not identical visions) work together voluntarily without central authority (or centralized support), undertake a project and succeed with large, complex undertakings. The \"answer\" though diffuse, incomplete and sub-optimal is for the \"workload\" &mdash; including identifying, discussing and analyzing problems to devising responses to the problems &mdash; to be divvied up &mdash; as \"intelligently\" as possible &mdash; so people, doing only \"pieces\" of the whole job can be successful in their collective enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis strategy is much easier to define and implement in the technological realm. One very successful example of this is the SETI@home project that employs the \"idle\" cycles of user\'s computers all over the world to analyze radio telescope data in a search for extraterrestrial intelligence. If, for example, one million computers working together on the people\'s search project, could devote some amount of processing power and storage to the project, the concept might suddenly become more feasible. \r\n\r\nAlthough it would be possible for every participating computer to run the same software, breaking up the tasks and distributing them across a large number of computers (thus allowing us to \"divide and conquer\") is likely to provide the most suitable architecture for a People\'s Search Engine. For one thing this allows dynamic re-apportioning of tasks: Changing the type of specialization that a computer is doing to make the overall approach more effective. At the beginning of \"Poogle\'s\" life, for example, half of the computers might be devoted to finding (or \"spidering\") and indexing websites while the other half might work on identifying which web sites meet the users\' search criteria and presenting a list of pertinent results to the user. After a week or so, it may become clear that the first task (identifying and indexing sites) may require less attention overall while the second task (handling user search requests) desperately needs more processing power. In this situation, some of the computers working on the first task could be re-assigned to the second task. Of course this situation might become reversed the following week and another adjustment would be necessary. In a similar way, the contents of indexes could be shifted from computer to computer to make more effective use of available disk space more efficiently while providing enough redundancy to ensure that the entire system works efficiently even though individual computers are being shut down or coming online all the time and without advance notice.\r\n\r\nThe People\'s Search Engine (PSE) would make all of its ordering / searching algorithms public. Google\'s page-ranking algorithm is fairly widely known, yet Google has adjusted it over the years to prevent it from being \"gamed\" in various ways by people who hope to increase the visibility of their web pages by \"tricking\" the algorithm to gain a higher page rank than the Google gods would bestow. Ideally the PSE would offer a variety of search approaches of arbitrary complexity to users. Thus people could use an existing, institutionalized classification scheme like the Dewey Decimal System or a personalized, socially-tagged \"folksonomy\" approach, a popularity approach a la Google, a social link approach like Amazon (\"People who searched for X also searched for Y\") or searches based on (and/or constrained by) \"meta-information\" about the pages, such as author, domain, publisher, or date last edited. \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h6>Card catalog photo from Duke University, http://www.lib.duke.edu/libtour/perkins/cardcat.htm</h6>', 'The development of \"open source,\" public domain approaches to information access is essential for equity and progress among the people of the world. The possibility of credible competition will serve as a reminder to for-profit concerns that access to information is a sacred human right. It would also help to maintain and extend the patterns of innovation that open protocols have made possible. Among other things, researchers and members of civil society need to work on classification systems for Internet resources. It is imperative that civil society focuses attention on open source approaches to searching, archiving and other information access needs. For many reasons, this will help in the evolving process of opening up the world of information to people everywhere.', NULL, 116, 605, '2006-11-20 13:27:28', '2006-11-20 12:58:22', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Is it possible that this medium can be re-engineered to good purpose?  Gamers and game designers should explore these possibilities as should policy-makers, NGOs, and other people interested in new educational possibilities.', 'The idea of using computer games for socially responsible purposes has some intriguing arguments in its favor. One is that people are already spending enormous amounts of time doing mindless virtual driving (at least they\'re not wasting gas!) and shooting virtual villains, etc.  If they\'re going to spend that much of their time gaming why not have them do something of value?  (or so that argument goes.) On the other hand, it\'s not clear that it would work.  Perhaps shooting is more fun than learning for some (or many or most?) people (but then according to the Harper\'s discussants, you can always trick them by giving them points or the right to use the virtual laser guns only after they did the \"educational\" thing, like adding the numbers or spelling the word.) But it\'s not obvious that even if people <i>like</i> playing an educational or socially responsible game that it would have any positive lasting effects. \r\n\r\nModels and simulations provide ways for people to explore situations that can\'t be experienced directly &mdash; <I>like the future.</I> At the same time we must acknowledge that these tools aren\'t as compelling as they could be. Well-designed interactive games have the potential to be educational in that people learn about the world as well as compelling &mdash; they thrust the gamer into the scenario. \r\n\r\nCertain types of video games are, on some level, not unlike simulations in which the computer extrapolates certain plausible outputs &mdash; both expected and unexpected &mdash; based on user selections or decisions.  Simulations, however, are \"serious\" while games by their very nature are frivolous &mdash; or so it would seem.\r\n\r\nWhat, in theory, could socially responsible video games achieve? One possibility is that they could improve cognitive skills including memorization of spelling and multiplication tables, as well as deeper skills such as analysis, interpretation, or evaluation. Another possibility is that one could learn a general feel or understanding  from the games; just as people get some type of general knowledge from visiting foreign countries. One could, for example, get an impression of what it would be like to, say, deliver relief food to refugees in a remote war zone. \r\n\r\nA video game, like a movie, book, or, even, a story told aloud, is not \"real.\" It\'s a creation of a parallel artificial world, or a world \"once removed\" from \"reality.\" In the early 1960s Yale psychology professor Stanley Millgram conducted a bold experiment that demonstrated (or was widely perceived as having demonstrated) how people were naturally inclined to follow orders from perceived authority figures, however illegitimate and immoral the orders might be. In those experiments, a \"doctor\" with official-looking garb tells the subject (misleadingly)  that he or she are going to be involved in a memory experiment. In the course of this experiment, the subject will push buttons that purportedly deliver increasingly powerful electric jolts to an unseen person in the next room, a confederate who doesn\'t seem to be able to master the memorization of a few words at a level that sufficiently pleases the experimenter. After the hapless person with the poor memory cries out in [feigned] pain, the real subject understandably balks at delivering more pain to the person in the next room. After the authority figure explains that they \"must continue\" with the experiment, the vast majority of the subjects elected to continue their regiment of electrical shocks to the unseen victim. A notable exception to this excursion into a morally dubious zone were people who had spent time in German concentration camps during World War II.  Many of them simply refused to deliver the punishment.\r\n\r\nOne plausible explanation is that the survivors who had actually witnessed situations in which blind obeisance to power led to barbarity, <I>learned</i> about its pitfalls, while those who had not been in such a situation had not. This suggests that video games could provide a type of rehearsal for situations that might arise in the future, serving much the same role as  it is believed that <I>play</I> does for children. \r\n\r\nIt is the possibility that video games could provide meaningful instruction that inspired Paul Rogat Loeb to propose a video game based on former U.S. Vice President Al Gore\'s \"Inconvenient Truth\" movie that explores the looming prospect of global warming and massive climate change: \"The game could build on Gores existing movie, slide show, and website, adapting whatever elements were useful, but also making the process more interactive, more engaging for an audience for whom games are a prime language. Why not put people in the role of climate scientists assessing the evidence, governmental and corporate decision makers, citizens trying to keep our society from driving off a cliff? Why not let them try out different ways of acting? (Loeb, 2006). \r\n\r\nVideo games could (at least theoretically) help society learn how to deal with various problems that people might encounter: emergencies, stolen elections, loss of civil liberties, etc, The fact is that our globalized, mediated, interconnected world thrusts a multitude of issues into our face that reveal our impotence: although they demand a response, individually we have nothing in our experience that helps us truly grapple with it &dash; let alone determine what that should be done about it. \r\n\r\nSeveral video games have been released, and several more are in planning, that are intended to teach people about real-world issues in ways that television new reports and formal education are unlikely to emulate. One game, \"Food Force\" developed by the United Nations World Food Program, puts players in the middle of a dangerous food relief mission on Sheylan, a fictional island in the Indian Ocean suffering from drought and civil war. Players airdrop food, drive down mine-infested roads, buy and distribute food and help rebuild.  Surprisingly, the game has been downloaded by over three million of people and is second in the number of free downloads only to \"America\'s Army,\" another \"serious game,\" this one a recruiting tool for the US Army (Rosenberg, 2006). \r\n\r\nThere are several new games with socially responsible orientations. One is called \"A Force More Powerful\" and designed to teach non-violent strategy. Others are based on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (PeaceMaker), genocide in Darfur, and Adventure Ecology in which two kids, Dash and Bay fight eco-threats and villains like Agent Waste and Professor Ignorance and the environment is represented as a \"a highly complex and interdependent system in which every life-form, air molecule and pebble plays a part\" (Snoonian, 2006). \r\n\r\nWhile video games are often damned because of their total disconnect from the \"real world,\" this separation may also have its virtues. According to Raph Koster (Wasik, 2006), there is a \" magic circle\" surrounding games and \"it has to be a circle games of no consequence.\" Formal education, on the other hand, generally does not have a \"magic circle of no consequence.\" In other words, failures &mdash; both small and large &mdash; at school have consequences that vary from minor annoyances and embarrassment to not being able to attend college or find meaningful employment after high school.', 'Will Wright, the designer of SimCity and other simulation games, commented on the goals he has for Spore, a new video game now in development: \"I want people to be able to step back five steps, five really big steps. To think about life itself and its potential-scale impact. I want the gamers to have this awesome perspective handed to them in a game. And then let them decide how to interpret it\" (Johnson, 2006). While we can\'t know how valid this perspective is and how his new game will promote those ways of thinking, it\'s clear that it represents a step up in relation to the majority of the other games that people play.', NULL, 535, 614, '2006-12-06 15:00:10', '2006-11-03 15:29:23', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(336, 326, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, 'Commercial interests in the form of large multi-national corporations strive to fulfill only the most profitable needs or wants.  In many cases, the highest or easiest profit aims at wants that may not ultimately be in the interests of the targetted consumers (let alone the workers or the environment).  For instance, many food companies focus on high fat, high sugar, high salt products that humans find tasty based on an evolutionary history in which these substances were difficult to find.  For people in the developed world, however, having access to such foods is unhealthy.  Furthermore, the way these foods are produced, transported and marketed involves unaccounted for costs to humanity.  This is just one example.  In general, corporations are not only motivated, but legally required to maximize profits, not meet actual human needs.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the economies of scale lead large companies to focus efforts on those wants that are best met by mass-produced goods and services.  There are a huge range of very specific needs that much smaller groups or individuals have which do not provide suffficient inducement for large companies to provide.\r\n\r\nThus, the corporately created world both fails to meet many human needs and even when it does produce value, it tends to focus on wants rather than needs and do so in a way that has many undesirable side-effects.', 'In a variety of arenas, including publishing scholarly work, the development of educational materials, and the development of useful, robust software, an \"open source\" process has shown itself to be very effective.  There are a variety of reasons why such a process is now timely.  First, there are a large number of people globally with access to the Internet.  This allows global communities with common interests to work together without the necessity of physical travel (which can be expensive in time and money).  Second, there are worked examples of people from many fields volunteering their efforts to create value for the common good of their community.  These examples serve, in turn, as models for other communities.  Third, there are a critical mass of people with time and knowledge to add value to such collective efforts.  Fourth, although it has been common in the past for those in power to use their power to keep their power, in modern times, a series of social and legal processes have been put in place to consolidate power into structures that are no longer effectively regulated by countervaling forces such as local governments or community pressure.  The first three factors make the use of Open Source feasible and the last makes it manditory.  In addition, Open Source has the capacity to personalize and customize value to much smaller groups than is feasible for large companies.  Thus, by offering Open Source materials, people may collectively fulfull a greater proportion of human needs and wants.  This is currently referred to as \"the long tail.\"  There are a very large number of people wanting a few common things and a very small number of people each wanting something different.  Open Source is much better positioned to fulfill those different things wanted by only a relatively few.', 'Perhaps the most articulate introduction to the general concept of open source is the introduction to Eric von Hippel\'s Democratizing Innovation: \r\n\r\n\"When I say that innovation is being democratized, I mean that users of products and services -- both firms and individual consumers -- are increasingly able to innovate for themselves.  User-centered innovation processes offer great advantages over the manufacturer-centric innovation development systems that have been the mainstay of commerce for hundres of years.  Users that innovate can develop exactly what they want, rather than relying on manufacturers to act as their (often very imperfact) agents.  Moreover, individual users do not have to develop everything they need on their own: they can benefit from innovations developed and freely shared by others.  The trend toward democractization of innovation applies to information products such as software and also to physical products.  As a quick illustration of the latter, consider the development of high-performance windsurfing techniques and equipment in Hawaii by an informal user group.\" \r\n\r\nProbably the most notable and widespread success story of \"open source\" is the development of open source software. The \"source code\" of any computer program is the complete set of instructions that the computer follows to provide its functions. There are two competing philosophies that determine the rules regarding the distribution of software \"source code.\" \r\n\r\nThe basic business orientation dictates that, above all, the source code should be kept private and that only people who are allowed to make changes to it -- either to add functionality or fix bugs -- are the people who are authorized by the company that owns it.  Although there are several variants, the \"free software\" or \"open source\" model if more-or-less the opposite of the corporation model in nearly all respects. Anybody can obtain the source code without cost.  Anybody can make changes to the source code.  And anybody can distribute the code without restriction to anybody.\r\n\r\nBesides its desirable price (nothing!), the open source model offers many advantages over the closed, corporate model.  One is that many eyes can identify and fix many bugs. Software flaws such as bugs or security holes are more readily found and exposed.  (This is the reason why fair voting advocates are generally in favor of open source voting software.) Another reason is that the open source model promotes innovation by allowing anybody to implement new functionality. Although many of the modifications may be unwanted,  some may provide a foundation for desirable features.  Although the open source approach has its own disadvantages (as do all approaches), it offers surprisingly stiff competition against deep-pocketed corporate behemoths.  Linux, for example, is more robust, less buggy and on a faster release cycle than well-funded corporately engineered operating systems.\r\n\r\nAlthough computer programmers have been at the forefront of this intellectual revolution, computer programs are certainly not the only complex artifacts that could be designed, built, maintained and improved through an open-source collective effort.\r\n\r\nOne obvious artifact to think about moving into open source development is the development of vaccines and other medicines.  And in this arena, medicines that could reduce suffering caused by the worldwide HIV-AIDS epidemic come to mind readily.  Of course, in so-called \"primitive\" societies, knowledge of how to find, prepare and use medicinal plants was a precious gift handed down from generation to generation. \r\n \r\nWith oil prices skyrocketing, open source automobile developers could work together on developing automobiles with super high mileage and other environmentally friendly features.  Already (NY Times August 2005) hobbyists are modifying Priuses and other hybrid vehicles to pump up the mileage.  (See \r\nRelated Patterns: \"Open Source Characters\", \"Open Source Scholarly Publications\" \"The Commons\" and \"Appropriation of Technology\"\r\n\r\nBecause corporations are driven primarily to maximize profits, they tend to focus efforts on the very popular and tend to ignore small niche interests.  For example, the open source music movement now allows individuals to create music collaboratively and globally.  Probably the most popular of these, adding 200 users per week is MacJams.  (See links below for general home page and to see what an individual\'s entry looks like).  Albums can be built and distributed on a one-off basis without the high up-front costs of using a recording studio.  \r\n\r\nSimilar avenues exists for poetry, stories, photographs, video and artwork.

Wright Mills\r\n\r\nIn 1956 sociologist C. Wright Mills\' <i>The Power Elite</i> provided an in-depth examination of power in the United States. About a decade later, in 1967, G. William Domhoff wrote <i>Who Rules America?</i> which was followed by <i>Who Rules America Now?</i> in 1983. As one might expect, these books contained a detailed analysis of who has power, how the power is exercised and through what routes the powerful came to their positions. To some degree, the who of \"who has power\" is not as relevant as <i>what</i> they do with it and <i>how</i> they came to possess it. Their routes to power were so uniform as to suggest that specific, repeatable social mechanisms were at work to ensure that the same type of person, with the same ideologies would be elevated to these positions &mdash; and that other people from other circumstances would be denied entrance. \r\n\r\nThat social mechanisms are at play is of course not news to sociologists who make it their business to understand these mechanisms. The rest of us have vague suspicions but little concrete knowledge. Although the powerful may be visible to some degree the representations that we witness in the media are likely to be sanitized, scrubbed clean of improprieties, stereotyped and otherwise rendered useless for thoughtful consideration. This knowledge is vital to all participants in a democratic society. Knowing who and how people who occupy the seats of power wield the levers of social control is key to positive social change.\r\n\r\nWhile the work of Mills and Domhoff have uncovered the processes of the maintenance of power in America, it is undoubtedly the case that similar processes are being played out every day around the world.  For that reason, it\'s imperative that these studies be undertaken throughout the world. The point of gaining an understanding of these processes is not to insert different people into the process (although in many cases this is desirable). Nor do we gain this understanding in order to derail the entire system or to just \"throw the bastards out.\" (After all, in some cases the people holding power may not be scoundrels!) An understanding of the process will help us adjust the system as necessary, know where the points of intervention exist and, in general, increase the level of awareness thus making it more difficult for the people with less power to be bamboozled by those with more. \r\n\r\nThere are many exciting examples of this pattern. One particularly compelling one is based on the Reflect theory. It combines adult learning and social change using the theories of Paulo Freire integrated with participatory methodologies. Their report on <i>Communication and Power</i> describes how written and spoken word, images and numbers can be used by villagers in India (see figure below) in analyses of caste power.', 'Research power &mdash; what it is, how is it organized and applied, who has it. Although it is important to make the findings freely available. It is at least as important to disseminate the ideas and techniques that help people initiate their own power research projects.

Unfortunately the use of this pattern is limited generally to democratic societies or other places where its confrontational approach is tolerated. There are countries, for example, where a tribunal directed at the United States could be convened, while a tribunal directed against the government of the host country would be strictly prohibited. Unfortunately there are few, if any, public or legal means where citizens of countries like North Korea, Uzbekistan and other countries that are isolated from the network of international relations, can challenge their government\'s policy without fearing for their life and liberty.', 'Civil Society faced with what they perceive as serious crimes that are being perpetrated by governments, has devised the concept of a \"Citizen\'s Tribunal.\" Part legal proceedings, part theater, part publicly speaking \"truth to power\", the concept has been expressed most strongly with the World Tribunal on Iraq (WTI) condemning the invasion of Iraq by the United States. \r\n\r\nAccording to Richard Falk, professor emeritus from Princeton University, \"The WTI was loosely inspired by the Bertrand Russell tribunal held in Copenhagen and Stockholm in 1967 to protest the Vietnam War, which documented with extensive testimony the allegations of criminality associated with the American role in Vietnam. The Russell tribunal featured the participation of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and other notable European left intellectuals. It relied on international law and morality to condemn the war but made no pretension of being a legal body, and its jury contained no international law experts.\" The World Tribunal on Iraq had its specific roots in a session of the Permanent Tribunal of the People that was held before the war in Rome. The sessions of the WTI began in Brussels in March 2004 and finished in June 2005 in Istanbul. Sessions were also held in Berlin, Stockholm, Hiroshima, Rome, New York, and Barcelona. \r\n\r\nThe work of the WTI was divided into a <i>Panel of Advocates</i> and a <i>Jury of Conscience.</i> The role of the Panel of Advocates was to document the charges against George Bush, Tony Blair, and others through analysis and testimony. This body would then present the case to a Jury of Conscience which was \"composed of distinguished moral authority personalities from around the world, to pass judgment on the actors and their actions from the perspective of international law.\"\r\n\r\nOne question is how does the \"other side\" participate &mdash; if at all? Can they submit evidence or provide testimony? In other words, how does a tribunal differ from a trial? For one thing, the U.S., for example, the U.S. would undoubtedly skip a Citizen\'s Tribunal since it has declined to appear before the World Court as a defendant. A Citizen\'s Tribunal is not a <i>court</i> (it obviously has no powers of enforcement, for example) and is not obligated to emulate one. At least in the case of the WTI, a Citizen\'s Tribunal \"is self-consciously an organ of civil society, with its own potential enforcement by way of economic boycotts, civil disobedience and political campaigns.\" It is not designed to <i>find</i> the truth but to bring the truth to light.  As Falk points, out, the WTI as <i>an instrument of civil society:</i> \"proceeds from a presumption that the allegations of illegality and criminality are valid and that its job is to reinforce that conclusion as persuasively and vividly as possible.\r\n\r\nLegitimacy, however, as in the legal system, is a very big issue. If the tribunal does not seem legitimate, it can more easily be portrayed as a charade. Legitimacy can be maximized by providing unimpeachable authorities and by providing strong corroborating evidence including documentation and expert testimony. \r\n\r\nAs a direct and public challenge to power and authority the Citizen\'s Tribunal faces numerous challenges in addition to difficult task of establishing legitimacy. One of the most important of these challenges is irrelevance. The unequivocal repudiation of the powers-that-be is unlikely to be covered in any serious way by the media. Additionally, the possibly marginal nature of the group sponsoring a Citizen\'s Tribunal places it far from the centers of power and is thus questioned about the legitimacy of its actions. \r\n\r\nSince the power of a Citizen\'s Tribunal relies on its symbolic nature, publicity is important. One approach is to bring in a broad coalition to organize the Tribunal. It is important to get people to the event and to send out publicity afterwards (through, for example, the web and DVDs). The WTI submitted its report to the United Nations.  On the other hand, exposure and publicity can be risky &mdash; counter demonstrations, arrests, intimidation and thuggery, in addition to media condemnation, might be in store for the conveners. \r\n\r\nMany challenges present themselves while organizing and conducting the event: Who will participate? How is the agenda organized? Where will the funding come from? How will security issues be handled?  And of course, the idea of multiple venues, however attractive the idea is, increases the magnitude of the logistical challenges considerably. \r\n\r\nAlthough Falk\'s statement below (from a WTI press release) is associated with the World Tribunal on Iraq, the basic approach and philosophy of that effort can serve as a basic model (that can be modified) for another tool for people without extensive resources who are struggling with issues of state violence and other urgent issues of our times. <blockquote>\"The WTI is opposing aggressive war, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. It is not opposing the governments or the United Nations. Indeed it hopes to create pressure from below that will encourage law-abiding governments and the UN to do their proper job of protecting weaker countries and their populations against such illegalities. And beyond this protection we are promoting a world movement of peoples and governments to realize a humane form of globalization that is equitable with respect to the world economy, legitimate in upholding the human rights of all, and dedicated above all else to creating the conditions for sustainable peace based on justice for every nation on earth.\"</blockquote>', 'In certain situations, civil society organizations are moved to protest perceived crimes of sovereign nations.

These acts are kept hidden from those on the outside until such time as they are uncovered by somebody on the outside or exposed by somebody on the inside. The pressures on an \"insider\" to keep quiet about the transgression are immense.  Although society as a whole benefits from the new revelations, the whistle-blower is likely to be seen as a traitor to his or her community and punished heartily for his or her efforts; He or she could be shunned at work, fired, \"black-balled\" (denied employment in general in the future) , or, even, physically harmed.  Of course, even after it\'s revealed to the world, the damaging evidence can be ignored by the media or spun into irrelevance by the institution and its allies. \r\n\r\nIn a section called \"Blowing the Whistle Wisely\", Devine discusses \"basic survival strategies\" which are listed below. <ol><li>Before taking any irreversible steps, talk to your family or close friends about your decision to blow the whistle.</li><li>Develop a plan so that your employer is reacting to you, instead of vice-versa.</li><li>Be alert and discretely attempt to learn of any other people who are upset about the wrongdoing.</li><li>Before formally breaking ranks, consider whether there is any reasonable way to work within the system by going to the first level of authority.</li><li>Maintain good relations with administrative and support staff.</li><li><em>Before and after</em> you blow the whistle, it is very important to protect yourself by <em>keeping a careful record of events as they unfold.</em></li><li>Identify and copy all necessary supporting records before drawing any attention to your concerns.</li><li>Research and identify potential allies such as elected officials, journalists or activists who have proven their sincerity and can help expose the wrongdoing.</li><li>Either invest the funds for a legal opinion from a competent lawyer, or talk to a non-profit watchdog organization about the risks and obstacles facing you.</li><li>Always be on guard not to embellish your charges.</li><li>Engage in whistleblowing initiatives on your own time and with your own resources, not your employer\'s.</li><li>Don\'t wear your cynicism on your sleeve when working with authorities.</li></ol>\r\nWhistle blowing arises within government institutions as well as commercial concerns and, as a matter of fact, has some degree of legal protection &mdash; at least in some  countries. One of the most important examples of government abuse include corruption, violation of human rights (by allowing torture, for example) or by hiding decisions, such as a decision to start a war while publicly asserting that peace is being sought.

In some cases, this is due to a reticence on the part of the mainstream media to tackle controversial issues. However, this can also simply happen because inadequate communication tactics prevent the public from identifying with or understanding the language used to convey the intended message. In other words, many actions organized by activist organizations go unnoticed, either because they do not succeed in showcasing their cause through means that cannot be ignored by the media, or because their lines of argument cannot be easily connected with the ways non-activist audiences experience the world.', 'Tactical Media (TM) are a loosely defined set of practices that can be used by activists and community groups seeking to engage with the production of counter-information, as well as with its modes and possibilities of dissemination. In fact, the tactical circulation of information is a fundamental aspect of political intervention in the informational environment.', '\"Tactical media are media of crisis, criticism and opposition. This is both the source of their power, and also their limitation. Their typical heroes are the activist, Nomadic media warriors, the pranxter, the hacker, the street rapper, the camcorder kamikaze...\" (the ABC of Tactical Media)\r\n\r\n	Because of their ad-hoc character and their adaptability to different contexts, TM are hard to define. Hence, instead of what is TM? a more useful question is how does TM work? The following three examples are helpful to illustrate some of TMs possible uses and outcomes.\r\n\r\n	Example one: During the last US presidential campaign Bushs official website was cloned, with the alternative site featuring a critique of Bushs agenda to become president. This site was set up by the Yes Men, a group of actors who impersonate representatives of important organisations at official meetings in order to subvert their messages in the mainstream media. Their stunt prompted Bush to announce on television that there ought to be limits to democracy.\r\n\r\n	Example two: Several labour activist groups in Europe, fighting against unstable working conditions use TM for their campaigns. The Italian group Chainworkers invented Saint Precario, the patron saint of precarious workers. His statue appears at demonstrations, public events and in public spaces, constructing precarity through familiar symbols, and leading the public to make its own connections between the procession, common peoples problems and todays world market. Through San Precario and other similar games and actions, the issue of precarious labor has gained visibility within the EU and is now being discussed even outside of its borders--while more sustainable forms of social struggle against precarity are the background on which such actions rest.\r\n\r\n	Example three: Telestreet is a network pirate television stations run by activists and community groups who use free UHF frequencies and simple, low-cost technological devices to broadcast their video productions into Italian households. Telestreet programming is not solely aimed at counterbalancing Berlusconis monopoly on the mainstream media with alternative content, but also at experimenting with the medium of television as a space for cultural production and community building.\r\n	\r\n	Generally, TM rely on artistic practices and \"do it yourself\" (DIY) media, created from readily available, relatively cheap technology and means of communication. A tactical medium is devised according to the context where it is supposed to function. This means that it is sensitive to the different sets of communicative genres and resources valued in a specific place, which may vary from street theatre and banner-dropping to the internet or radio. For this reason, TM actions they are very effective and can take on a wide variety of forms. For instance, they can mimic traditional means of information while circulating alternative content; they can subvert the meaning of well-known cultural symbols; and, they can create new outlets for counter-information with the help of new media. \r\n\r\n	In many cases, TM practitioners borrow from avant-garde art practices (e.g. linguistic sabotage and detournement), politics and consumer culture to trouble commonly held beliefs about every-day life. Such techniquesalso called culture jamminginvolve an appropriation of the language and discourses of their political target, which is familiar to the non-activist audience. Therefore, the subversion of the messages meaning pushes the audience to notice where some strategies of domination are at work in a given discourse, raising questions about the objectivity of what is believed to be normal. TM actions creatively reframe known discourses, causing the public to recognize their limits. According to TM theorist David Garcia classical TM, unlike agit-prop, are designed to invite discourse (Garcia 2006), they plant the seeds for discussion by operating a fissure in what is considered to be objective reality, requiring a form of engagement to decode their message. \r\n\r\n	Despite many successes, TM practices like the Yes Men impersonations have often been criticized because their short-term interventions expose the weak points in the system but do not attempt to address them. However, TM should not be seen or employed as an isolated form of protest but as one tool for groups to reach wider audiences in a broader network of political struggle. In fact, even when they hijack the attention of the mass media, the Yes Men stunts and Saint Precario do not constitute an emancipatory practice in itself. Yet, they are a great example of how to bring topics to debate. As part of an organized campaign centred on a specific issue, such stunts can give resonance to voices otherwise unheard, and hopefully open up some space for a dialogue between minority and majority groupsor between minorities. \r\n\r\n	Moreover, TM practices can help make transversal connections between context-related social, cultural and political problems, and various organized sites of resistance. For example, the Telestreet network enables different activist groups and coalitions to use their space to support or showcase their own cause. Similarly, TM practices can be useful to create new memes that raise awareness of unjust social conditions, as in the case of Saint Precario.\r\n\r\n	Ultimately, it is important to maintain TMs emphasis on experimentation, collaboration and the exchange of knowledge as part of a broader cartography of organized social struggle. For these reasons, there is a need to create more conditions where TM exploration of new possibilities for resistance can take place. Such projects can range from media literacy teaching to culture jamming workshops in schools, to festivals and temporary media labs where people can come together and develop creative ways to engage in protest and critique of the systems which govern their lives from an ever-increasing distance.', 'TM practices are marked by an ongoing attempt to experiment with the dynamics of media dissemination of information, searching for the most effective way to bypass the obstacles created during the diffusion of such information, in order to reach an audience. Thus, TM actions can help activists attract the attention of the mainstream media, as well as enable them to convey their message in a way that is intelligible to the audience.\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Photo Credit: www.insutv.it', NULL, 740, 427, '2006-12-11 10:30:50', '2006-11-10 08:09:47', NULL, NULL, 'OISE/ University of Toronto', NULL, 352, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Like a drumbeat, its endless repetition presents an unremitting pulse to our lives. Corporate media is scripted by people far away from the \"ordinary\" people who spend their time with it. Alternatives to corporate media exist of course, but the audiences are substantially smaller; the alternatives generally have lower \"production values\" (due to fewer resources) and are much harder to find.  Consequently they are enjoyed only by the more intrepid among us.  People and organizations who struggle to interject alternative messages into the public consciousness via the media &mdash; even with paid ads &mdash; will be soundly rebuffed. For example, the AdBusters Foundation has repeatedly attempted to get their \"Buy Nothing\" piece aired on television in the US. only to be turned down by the major networks.  MoveOn\'s \"Bush in 30 Seconds\" was also rejected by the networks. Environmental organizations have trouble getting their messages aired but corporate ads on the same themes are aired without questions.', 'When access to media is blocked...', 'Until fairly recently, it was a commonly held notion in the United States that \"the people owned the airwaves.\" Although that notion has apparently vanished from the minds  of many politicians and government regulators, people periodically reassert this right when other routes have failed. \r\n\r\nWith few exceptions, access to media is generally blocked to citizen and, especially, alternative viewpoints. The choices of media often boil down to state-run media (often propaganda) or purely commercial (or a combination of the two) or none at all.\r\n\r\nIn the US particularly but in other countries as well people are bombarded with images and ideas that are generally cut from the same cloth. Whether news, \"reality\" shows, police dramas, talk shows, or commercials television is a seamless and impenetrable wall that is assiduously protected from invasion. Media Intervention is one tactic to fight this particular and ubiquitous form of censorship. In this case, the media truly is the message: while the content itself is commercialistic, addicting, intellectually and psychologically (and emotionally?  and politically?) stultifying (debilitating?), the sheer immensity and second order effects of the media as a societal phenomenon make it impossible to ignore. It\'s a problem for everyone when the \"vast wasteland\" grows vaster. \r\n\r\nMedia intervention comes in many guises and new approaches are devised fairly frequently. There are vast differences in the ways that this pattern is employed &mdash; all the way from the most polite and prescribed to the most overt and officially prohibited. This pattern is general enough to encompass Culture Jamming (Lasn, ____), Textual Poaching (Jenkins, ____), subvertisements, \"disciplining the media\" and \"Billboard Adjustment.\" \r\n\r\nRandolph Sill carried out a brilliant Media Interventio with aplomb in Seattle in the summer of 2003. He attended a televised Mariner\'s baseball game with a sign that was adorned with the number of Mariner star player, Ichiro Suzuki, and some writing in Kanji. Unbeknownst to  the non-Japanese speakers at the game and, in particular, the people who were televising the game who captured Sill and the sign that he enthusiastically brandished whenever Ichiro was at bat, the Kanji on one side read, \"President Bush is a monkey\'s butt\" which was complemented on the other side with the claim that \"Americans are ashamed of their corrupt president\" (Jenniges, 2003). \r\n\r\nIn the late 1990\'s, the Barbie Liberation Organization engineered a similarly clever caper which ultimately was covered with bemusement on the television evening news in a number of U.S. cities. The intervention began with the purchase of several ultra-feminine \"Barbie\" dolls and the ultra-masculine \"G.I. Joes\" \"action figures\" (not <i>dolls</i>). Back in their secret laboratory, the BLO surgically altered the dolls, performing a gender swap (or \"correction\" as they called it) of the voice boxes of the two stereotypical avatars. Then the dolls were repackaged and placed (\"reverse shoplifting\") on various toy store shelves around the country where they were purchased by unsuspecting shoppers. Back at home, the young recipients of the dolls were surprised when the he-man Joe professed a love for shopping while the wire-thin Barbie newly masculinized wanted to \"take the next hill\" presumably with a hail of hot lead. One intriguing postscript was that at least some of the recipients of the transformed doll/action figure preferred the new version to the old. \r\n\r\nFinally, the techniques of (1) trying hard to get one\'s issue injected into the media and (2) <i>disciplining</i> the media for content that people find objectionable (and, less frequently, <i>praising</i> the media for appropriate coverage), form the traditional \"bread and butter\" core of this pattern and are not expected to go away or lose their importance in the face of the other approaches discussed earlier. \r\n\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"http://www.actupny.org/divatv/netcasts/news_zap_animation.gif\"><br>NY Act Up Activists Make an Unscheduled Visit to the CBS Evening News.<br />More information can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.actupny.org/divatv/indexN.html\">http://www.actupny.org/divatv/indexN.html</a></center>', 'Sometimes it  becomes necessary to intervene in the media to nudge it into new avenues that it might not have taken without the intervention.

People must sometimes <i>take to the streets</i> to visibly express their dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nLarge public demonstrations are probably the most overt form of protest.  It is hard to deny the reality of thousands, tens or hundreds of thousands of people, in the streets peacefully marching, with banners and signs, music, costumes, noisemakers and other devices that have been spontaneously and individually designed. Though often portrayed in the media as marginal and/or dangerous, mass demonstrations (such as those in the Ukraine in December 2004) are generally peaceful and, indeed, suitable for the whole family. As a matter of fact, the presence of families and older people helps ensure that the demonstrations are peaceful. Through their visibility, they also help to legitimize the protest by showing that the concerns aren\'t limited to one  demographic use, youths, for example. \r\n\r\nIn February, 2003, the world witnessed the largest expression of this pattern in history. People gathered in over 600 ciites in over 40 countries worldwide to protest the invasion of Iraq by the world\'s only superpower. Although the Bush administration was undeterred by this unprecedented display of disapproval, the idea of peace as an ideal was brought forward by civil society worldwide and held aloft as a universal idea &mdash; one that citizens must not allow governments to pursue &mdash; or ignore &mdash; according to their own calculations and motivations. \r\n\r\nMass peaceful demonstrations don\'t take place in a vacuum.  They need to be tied to broader strategy. This often involves engaging with the media and with established governing (or intermediating) entities. It is often helpful to have a clear set of demands. Finally, although this doesn\'t always happen, measures like gathering names and contact information can be used to help build a large activist network that persists beyond the duration of the protest itself. \r\n<blockquote><blockquote><em>I was dreaming in my dreaming\r\nOf an aspect bright and fair\r\nAnd my sleeping it was broken\r\nBut my dream it lingered near\r\nIn the form of shining valleys\r\nWhere the pure air recognized\r\nAnd my senses newly opened\r\nI awakened to the cry\r\nThat the people / have the power\r\nTo redeem / the work of fools\r\nUpon the meek / the graces shower\r\nIts decreed / the people rule</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Patti Smith, \"The People Have the Power\"\r\n</blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<font size=\"-3\">I think that the photograph of the demonstration in Los Angeles (early 2003) against the US invasion of Iraq used above is from a web site that helped promote the worldwide peace demonstrations.</font>', 'Peaceful, mass public demonstrations both large and small, in combination with other forms of dissent are sometimes necessary.', NULL, 372, 849, '2006-10-12 19:42:13', '2006-10-12 17:13:05', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Since there is apparently scant profit in trips that would help bridge cultures and encourage understanding, there is little support for it.

Our ultimate destination was Caracas, Venezuela, one of the three locations of the \"polycentric\" World Social Forum in 2006, but we visited Barquisemeto and the small hillside village of Sanare. Our tour was conducted by <i>Global Exchange,</i> a non-profit organization located in California,  that leads \"Reality Tours\" to nearly 30 countries including Afghanistan, China, Ireland, Mexico, India, Iran, the Mexican-US border, and Cuba. We visited a number of community centers, health clinics, educational missions, agricultural cooperatives, and housing developments set up by the Ch&aacute;vez government. Also, during the bus drive from Barquisemeto to Caracas our guide briefed us about recent Venezuelan history from the point of view of Ch&aacute;vez supporters as well as detractors. <i>Global Exchange</i>set up numerous presentations including one from an economics professor (with opposition leanings) who explained some of the particularities of the Venezuelan economy. We also had ample opportunities to converse with people at the forum.\r\n\r\nActivist road trips can provide more meaning than standard, non-activist, road trips. But how is the pattern employed? At a basic level, people can simply go on an activist road trip. This means pursuing activist activities &mdash; especially learning &mdash; while \"on the road.\" The preferred mode of transportation is by foot, bicycle, or car; possibly by bus or train; and probably not  by airplane where unscheduled stops and flexible timetables aren\'t allowed. This is not to suggest that the trip should be haphazard or random &mdash; just that serendipity is likely to come into play (and chance favors the prepared mind). Thinking about the trip ahead of time, planning for it, arranging to meet with various people and organizations in advance is very useful &mdash; just don\'t over schedule or otherwise become slave to your plan. A simple way to \"ground\" the trip is to attend events at the destination and at points along the way. Events could include anything from a mass rally to a simple breakfast with friends of friends. And don\'t forget to record your impressions during the trip and debrief and discuss upon your return. \r\n\r\nPeople can always elect to go on an Activist Road Trip but the concept itself must be <i>institutionalized</i> to make it easier for people in general to go on these trips and, ideally, to build active networks of people who are interested in similar issues. As with other patterns we concentrate on how to promote this incrementally, with little pieces that organically build towards larger networks or assemblies, rather than through a grand, top-down, plan. Therefore we must build upon the basic components: physical locations, activists (hosts, guest, and guides), information and means of getting from one place to the next. Many pieces of this pattern now exist. When, for example, punk rock aficionados, travel they often share information with each other  whos cool in the next town, whose couch is available, etc. This worksat least to some degree for the punk community, but what if a non-punk (like me?) wants to meet with some punks or if a punk wants to find out more about a non-punk group?\r\n\r\nThe chore is to help promote processes and ideas to build a thriving alternative to existing approaches to travel that are disconnected and disengaged. Ideally each visit helps to build the network while advancing positive social change. How can the network promote people from different communities getting together? Some of the pieces that we can envision include integrated calendar of events and atlases specifically designed for this type of trip. These atlases would necessarily be dynamic &mdash; events as well as the non-profits, infoshops and other host organizations &mdash; are often short-lived. \r\n\r\nOf course the above discussion suggests that the point of the road trip is to visit activist sites along the way.  Another approach is going on a road trip <i>as activists.</i> The <i>Bee Hive Collective</i> that travels throughout Latin American and develops intricate and beautiful murals that illustrate indigenous issues and struggles, and the <i>Miss Rockaway Armada</i> that traveled down the Mississippi River in the summer of 2006 to share art, music, environmentalism and an anarchist perspective with everyone they met, are great examples of this. In both of those cases, the groups essentially brought their activism with them. The ultimate activist road trip in the U.S. would have to be the Freedom Rides in the spring of 1961 where activists traveling on buses from Washington, DC to various towns and cities in the deep South to publicize their fight for civil rights were met with racist violence that was only quelled after federal intervention. \r\n\r\nA person implementing this pattern should expect a number of challenges. For example, people working in one activist destination could be overwhelmed by large numbers of people passing through. It is incumbent on the traveler to make sure that the host is not taken advantage of. Visitors must be sensitive to their host\'s situation and aware of their responsibilities as guests. Encounters between visitor and host, important as they are, have several potential complications. Who knows that the field trip to, say, a worker\'s collective is not to a \"Potemkin village\" that has been carefully \"staged\" in order to convey certain impressions to the guests, perhaps in a bid for funding. And how do we ensure that the visitors to a favella in Rio De Janeiro, a township in Capetown, or to the South Bronx, are not simply treating what they\'re witnessing as a spectacle. \r\n\r\nThe possibility exists that when any destination is made public, in an atlas, for example, hostile townspeople might choose to harass the travelers or the host. There could also be other types of vexing side-effects. If, for example, people in the hosting situation were serving food to visitors, the local health department could decide to pay a call on an illegal dining establishment. Also, the network is built on social relationships and the ones encountered in an Activist Road Trip are more likely to be dynamic than more established venues.  \r\n\r\nThere are dozens of  possible places to visit on an Activist Road Trip: activist organizations, collectives, shelters, migrant camps, small businesses, reservations, encampments, sanctuaries, labor halls, organic farms, conferences, concerts, environmental disasters, prisons, community media centers, barrios, refugee camps, etc. Ideally the travelers could stop at \"World Citizen Travel Bureaus\" along the way or at \"People\'s Embassies\" or, even a \"Museum of Civil Society\" &mdash; if people create them! \r\n\r\nAnd People can add an Activist Road Trip to another trip. Rather than fly in to their destination, dropping in out of the sky as it were, people could explore the region en route to, or returning from, the event to observe first hand the realities that the forum examines. This can even be done <I>within</I> the city itself. One doesn\'t have to travel very far &mdash; physically &mdash; to find unexplored regions. The Activist Road Trip can be done in your own region or city. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The photo above is from <a href=\"http://www.missrockawayarmada.org/\">The Miss Rockaway Armada</a> web site.

Its intended to help people <i>disengage, recharge</i> and to <i>re-engage</i> in ways that are more lively, more creative, more caring and more wise.\r\n\r\nOur species is millions of years old and the universe we inhabit is incomprehensibly vaster in size and in age.  The rhythms of our universe, the seasons of the earth and our body likewise seem timeless, they exist still, within what John Trudell calls our \"genetic memory.\" The rhythms of timeless life are not the same as those of television, the Internet, the workaday world.\r\n\r\nThe practice of cramming tasks into specific, discrete slots of time makes the declaration that the task <i>will</i> take that much time even when a slot with more or less time may be the right amount for the job.  Educating people for example, as teachers know, isnt done best in an assembly line fashion.  Some students need more time, some less, and, or course, the type of lesson etc. should vary as well.\r\n\r\nWhen life is routinized, when all of one\'s actions are circumscribed by external events and canned responses, internalized clichés, the ability to change direction and to pursue a different path is minimized. A retreat, a <i>break</i> in the process is necessary; for it is during those times &mdash; however brief &mdash; when this change can occur. \r\n\r\nThe digital realm, for social (as well as structural) reasons, has helped promote a culture where answers or solutions exist.  The Internet is good for finding facts, (what Centerville in the U.S. has the largest populations?  Centerville, Iowa.) but cant teach analysis, interpretation, critique, or, even common sense.  Reality even when addressed artificially through computer simulations (a <i>proper use</i> of computer when its limitations are sufficiently appreciated) must cope with numerous <i>levels</i> of complexity and interaction.\r\n\r\nThe (post-?) modern world of the Internet, mass media, \"virtual reality,\" globalization, spectacle, empty abstractions, and real-time data, on the one hand, and SUVs, AIDS, homeless children picking through garbage for food, landless peasants, mega mansions and mega-slums, on the other hand, are both \"real.\"  They both exist as perceptable information that exists in our individual and collective minds, which, even if intangible, has tangible implications.  Our thoughts, ideas, and memories, no matter how incoherent, paranoid or illogical, play themselves out the \"real world:\" \r\n\r\nThe wilderness or other setting relatively unperturbed by humankind is probably the best setting for the practice of this pattern: \"Alone in the forest, time is less \'dense,\' less filled with information; space is very \'close\'; smell and hearing and touch reassert themselves.  It is keenly sensual. In a true wilderness we are like that much of the time, even in broad daylight. Alert, careful, literally \'full of care.\' Not because of principles or practice, but because of something very old\" (Turner, 1989). \r\n\r\nThe function of this pattern language is to acknowledge and celebrate seeds of life that can be used to generate more life in the face of violence and corruption.  Remaining pure or removed, aloof from the sordidness of the world that has developed over the centuries, is not an option.  Nor is it necessarily more admirable than retreating into the vast media wastelands, work, mysticism, sports, or drugs. Engagement and retreat together form an eternal cycle that we ignore at our own peril.', 'People need to set up times to think, to step back and to recharge their batteries. After this respite, one is more likely to be happy, committed, and ready to re-engage once again. Retreat and reflection are necessary counterparts to engagement and both are necessary in the \"fierce struggle to create a better world.\"', NULL, 338, 0, '2006-11-20 13:28:43', '2006-11-20 13:03:06', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Muller called it a ‘‘merging, surging, voice of the people of the world.’’ And James Moore (2003), a multifaceted scholar, activist, and businessperson, called this same phenomenon the ‘‘second superpower’’ whose ‘‘beautiful but deeply agitated face . . . is the worldwide peace campaign,’’ and ‘‘the body of the movement is made up of millions of people concerned with a broad agenda that includes social development, environmentalism, health, and human rights.’’ Both are expressions of pent-up desire and a will to work for a better world, and both are manifestations of civic intelligence. \r\n\r\nTo meet the need for civic problem solving, governments, companies, nongovernmental \r\norganizations ( NGOs) citizens, and ordinary people are beginning to acknowledge the vast problems that humankind now faces and are devising new strategies, tactics, and paradigms to ameliorate them.

People and organizations need both general paradigms and speciﬁc ideas to help them devise tactics and strategies that further their objectives while working cooperatively with other people and organizations. \r\n\r\nCivic intelligence, like Daniel Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence (1995) or the various types of intelligences identiﬁed by Howard Gardner in Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983) (or even erotic intelligence, the cover story in a recent edition of the Utne Reader (September/October 2003)), is a type of intelligence, one with a speciﬁc focus; it can be used to explore and invigorate a ﬂexible and powerful competence that goes beyond the traditional notion of intelligence (which is typically equated to what IQ tests measure) in several important ways. Civic intelligence is a type of intelligence that focuses on the betterment of society as a whole, not just on individual aggrandizement. Moreover since it is a capability of society as a whole, its manifestation is collective and distributed throughout the population. The boundary between one person’s ‘‘intelligence’’ and another person’s ‘‘intelligence’’ is permeable, indistinct, and constantly shifting. Ideas in your mind today might be central to my understanding of the world tomorrow. How ‘‘intelligent’’ would one person be without interacting with other people directly (through discussion or argument) or indirectly (through reading books, watching television, or pondering works of art) or with the nonhuman world (observing nature, for example). \r\n\r\nCivic Intelligence builds on what we know about how people learn and maintain knowl- \r\nedge about the world and their place within it. Intelligent behavior in individuals is rich and multifaceted. It involves perception, monitoring, deliberating, remembering and forgetting, categorizing, coming up with new ideas and modifying old ones, negotiating and discussing, making decisions, testing hypotheses, and experimenting. Society as a whole engages in analogous activities, and these are embedded in our institutions, traditions, artifacts, and conversations. That these activities of collective intelligence exist is indisputable. Less obvious but also true is the fact that they are all subject to change. The idea that they could and should be consciously improved is the heart of this pattern. This recommendation is bolstered by the ﬁndings of Jared Diamond, the prominent historian and author at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has extensively studied how societies face challenges with potentially catastrophic consequences. Somewhat incredibly, Diamond’s research reveals that the ‘‘commonest and most surprising’’ of the four ways in which societies fail to address their problems is their ‘‘failure even to try to solve a problem that it has perceived,’’ even one that ultimately results in that society’s collapse. To avoid that mistake, we must go beyond examining how we as a society collectively think and take a critical look at how our knowledge and ideas are—and could be—channeled into actions. \r\n\r\nThe number of organizations exhibiting civic intelligence today is vast and growing. There were ten times more transnational advocacy organizations in 2000 then there were in 1900 \r\n( Keck and Sikkink 1998). Not only are these organizations more numerous, but they are increasingly thoughtful and forward looking. While in the past, protest may have been simply opposed to something, it is not uncommon today for organizations to develop sophisticated analyses and policy recommendations. In an earlier exploration of civic intelligence (Schuler 2001), six dimensions were identiﬁed (orientation, organization, engagement, intelligence, products and projects, and resources) in which organizations and movements that demonstrate civic intelligence are likely to differ from those that do not. The set of attributes associated with those dimensions that tend to characterize civic intelligence organizations and movements is a ﬁrst approximation of a descriptive model of civic intelligence. Some notable examples (among tens of thousands) include the worldwide Indymedia network, the World Social Forum, the Global Fund for Women, Jubilee 2000, Science for the People, and New Tactics in Human Rights. Civic intelligence can also be manifested locally. The graphic at the beginning of the pattern, for example, shows how neighborhood art —in this case a mural about the causes and effects of asthma—can be educational and lead to political engagement and other proactive civic activities. Many of these efforts are of necessity holistic, multidisciplinary, and entrepreneurial since the people and organizations that the efforts would ideally engage with cannot necessarily be expected to do what might be considered the right thing. In an interesting turn of events, the idea of collective intelligence, which is not necessarily aligned with civic intelligence (also a form of collective intelligence), is now receiving attention from various quarters. One group, the cyber pundits, are hoping it will be the ‘‘next big thing.’’ Tim O’Reilly (2006), publisher of O’Reilly books and the man who coined the expression ‘‘Web 2.0,’’ deﬁnes it as ‘‘the business revolution in the computer \r\nindustry caused by the move to the Internet as platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform. ‘‘There is another side of this growing interest in collective intelligence as well. This approach is less concerned with making money and more about solving global problems. While these two groups have different aspirations, both of their revolutionary visions are generally based on side-effects or technical aspects, such as new algorithms, semantic webs, or tipping points. Both groups seem to place less faith in the value of collaboratively working together and thereby trying to address the problems that humankind is facing by actually addressing the problems.\r\n\r\nA complementary model (illustrated below and described in more detail at http://www \r\n.publicsphereproject.org/civint/model-functional.html) of civic intelligence that depicts its \r\nprimary functional processes has also been proposed (Schuler 2001). This model (or framework) is an amalgam of concepts from social change theory and models of education and human learning. The model is aimed at providing useful exploration in these areas as opposed to offering an algorithm or mechanism that always behaves accurately and with the prescribed result. Generally the two models are to be used in tandem: the descriptive model describes the what, while the functional model describes the how.  The functional model contains three main components: the environment, which includes everything that is relevant to the organization yet outside the organization; the mental model (or core), which corresponds to the sum of knowledge that the organization uses; and the remaining constituents of the organization, including its resources (e.g., people) and, most important, the interactive processes under the control of the organization that link the environment and the mental model. The functional model contains eight types of interactive processes that a movement, organization, or other group exhibits when engaging in civic intelligence: \r\n\r\n1. Monitoring How the organization acquires new relevant information nonintrusively. \r\n\r\n2. Discussion and deliberation How organizations discuss issues and determine common \r\nagendas, ‘‘issue frames’’ ( Keck and Sikkink 1998), and action plans with other organizations. The mental model of any participants or the organization itself can change as a result of the interactions. \r\n\r\n3. Engagement How the organization attempts to make changes through varying degrees of cooperation and combativeness. \r\n\r\n4. Resource transfer How noninformational resources like volunteers and money are \r\nacquired from the environment. \r\n\r\n5. Interpretation of new information How new information is considered and how it ulti- \r\nmately becomes (or does not become) part of the core. New information can also include information about the organization. \r\n\r\n6. Maintenance of mental model (includes resource management) How the organization \r\nmaintains its organizational integrity by consciously and unconsciously resisting change \r\nover time. \r\n\r\n7. Planning and plan execution How a campaign is initiated, carried out, and monitored. \r\n\r\n8. Modiﬁcation of mental model How the core itself is scrutinized by participants in the organization and modiﬁed. Another term for this is organizational learning. \r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of each of these processes will help determine the effectiveness of the \r\nentire organization. For that reason, it is important to develop surveys and other types of diagnostic tools that can help organizations use the civic intelligence paradigm effectively. This information could be key in evaluating actions or developing plans. Some of the other uses of this knowledge are inventorying civic intelligence initiatives of geographical regions or thematic activist areas, convening interorganizational workshops, designing curricula, planning campaigns, or even developing new organizations.

He was describing the unprecedented movement that arose simultaneously in hundreds of places around the world. What this movement represents is the advent of an immensely powerful force. Muller called it a ‘‘merging, surging, voice of the people of the world.’’ And James Moore (2003), a multifaceted scholar, activist, and businessperson, called this same phenomenon the ‘‘second superpower’’ whose ‘‘beautiful but deeply agitated face . . . is the worldwide peace campaign,’’ and ‘‘the body of the movement is made up of millions of people concerned with a broad agenda that includes social development, environmentalism, health, and human rights.’’ Both are expressions of pent-up desire and a will to work for a better world, and both are manifestations of civic intelligence. \r\n\r\nTo meet the need for civic problem solving, governments, companies, nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs) citizens, and ordinary people are beginning to acknowledge the vast problems that humankind now faces and are devising new strategies, tactics, and paradigms to ameliorate them. To help with these daunting tasks, a growing array of sociotechnical information and communication systems is being developed. People and organizations need both general paradigms and speciﬁc ideas to help them devise tactics and strategies that further their objectives while working cooperatively with other people and organizations. \r\n\r\nCivic intelligence, like Daniel Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence (1995) or the various types of intelligences identiﬁed by Howard Gardner in Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983) (or even erotic intelligence, the cover story in a recent edition of the Utne Reader (September/October 2003)), is a type of intelligence, one with a speciﬁc focus; it can be used to explore and invigorate a ﬂexible and powerful competence that goes beyond the traditional notion of intelligence (which is typically equated to what IQ tests measure) in several important ways. Civic intelligence is a type of intelligence that focuses on the betterment of society as a whole, not just on individual aggrandizement. Moreover since it is a capability of society as a whole, its manifestation is collective and distributed throughout the population. The boundary between one person’s ‘‘intelligence’’ and another person’s ‘‘intelligence’’ is permeable, indistinct, and constantly shifting. Ideas in your mind today might be central to my understanding of the world tomorrow. How ‘‘intelligent’’ would one person be without interacting with other people directly (through discussion or argument) or indirectly (through reading books, watching television, or pondering works of art) or with the nonhuman world (observing nature, for example). \r\n\r\nCivic Intelligence builds on what we know about how people learn and maintain knowledge about the world and their place within it. Intelligent behavior in individuals is rich and multifaceted. It involves perception, monitoring, deliberating, remembering and forgetting, categorizing, coming up with new ideas and modifying old ones, negotiating and discussing, making decisions, testing hypotheses, and experimenting. Society as a whole engages in analogous activities, and these are embedded in our institutions, traditions, artifacts, and conversations. That these activities of collective intelligence exist is indisputable. Less obvious but also true is the fact that they are all subject to change. The idea that they could and should be consciously improved is the heart of this pattern. This recommendation is bolstered by the ﬁndings of Jared Diamond, the prominent historian and author at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has extensively studied how societies face challenges with potentially catastrophic consequences. Somewhat incredibly, Diamond’s research reveals that the ‘‘commonest and most surprising’’ of the four ways in which societies fail to address their problems is their ‘‘failure even to try to solve a problem that it has perceived,’’ even one that ultimately results in that society’s collapse. To avoid that mistake, we must go beyond examining how we as a society collectively think and take a critical look at how our knowledge and ideas are—and could be—channeled into actions. \r\n\r\nThe number of organizations exhibiting civic intelligence today is vast and growing. There were ten times more transnational advocacy organizations in 2000 then there were in 1900 ( Keck and Sikkink 1998). Not only are these organizations more numerous, but they are increasingly thoughtful and forward looking. While in the past, protest may have been simply opposed to something, it is not uncommon today for organizations to develop sophisticated analyses and policy recommendations. In an earlier exploration of civic intelligence (Schuler 2001), six dimensions were identiﬁed (orientation, organization, engagement, intelligence, products and projects, and resources) in which organizations and movements that demonstrate civic intelligence are likely to differ from those that do not. The set of attributes associated with those dimensions that tend to characterize civic intelligence organizations and movements is a ﬁrst approximation of a descriptive model of civic intelligence. Some notable examples (among tens of thousands) include the worldwide Indymedia network, the World Social Forum, the Global Fund for Women, Jubilee 2000, Science for the People, and New Tactics in Human Rights. Civic intelligence can also be manifested locally. The graphic at the beginning of the pattern, for example, shows how neighborhood art —in this case a mural about the causes and effects of asthma—can be educational and lead to political engagement and other proactive civic activities. Many of these efforts are of necessity holistic, multidisciplinary, and entrepreneurial since the people and organizations that the efforts would ideally engage with cannot necessarily be expected to do what might be considered the right thing. In an interesting turn of events, the idea of collective intelligence, which is not necessarily aligned with civic intelligence (also a form of collective intelligence), is now receiving attention from various quarters. One group, the cyber pundits, are hoping it will be the ‘‘next big thing.’’ Tim O’Reilly (2006), publisher of O’Reilly books and the man who coined the expression ‘‘Web 2.0,’’ deﬁnes it as ‘‘the business revolution in the computer \r\nindustry caused by the move to the Internet as platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform. ‘‘There is another side of this growing interest in collective intelligence as well. This approach is less concerned with making money and more about solving global problems. While these two groups have different aspirations, both of their revolutionary visions are generally based on side-effects or technical aspects, such as new algorithms, semantic webs, or tipping points. Both groups seem to place less faith in the value of collaboratively working together and thereby trying to address the problems that humankind is facing by actually addressing the problems.\r\n\r\nA complementary model (illustrated below and described in more detail at http://www.publicsphereproject.org/civint/model-functional.html) of civic intelligence that depicts its primary functional processes has also been proposed (Schuler 2001). This model (or framework) is an amalgam of concepts from social change theory and models of education and human learning. The model is aimed at providing useful exploration in these areas as opposed to offering an algorithm or mechanism that always behaves accurately and with the prescribed result. Generally the two models are to be used in tandem: the descriptive model describes the what, while the functional model describes the how.  The functional model contains three main components: the environment, which includes everything that is relevant to the organization yet outside the organization; the mental model (or core), which corresponds to the sum of knowledge that the organization uses; and the remaining constituents of the organization, including its resources (e.g., people) and, most important, the interactive processes under the control of the organization that link the environment and the mental model. The functional model contains eight types of interactive processes that a movement, organization, or other group exhibits when engaging in civic intelligence: \r\n\r\n1. Monitoring How the organization acquires new relevant information nonintrusively. \r\n\r\n2. Discussion and deliberation How organizations discuss issues and determine common agendas, ‘‘issue frames’’ ( Keck and Sikkink 1998), and action plans with other organizations. The mental model of any participants or the organization itself can change as a result of the interactions. \r\n\r\n3. Engagement How the organization attempts to make changes through varying degrees of cooperation and combativeness. \r\n\r\n4. Resource transfer How noninformational resources like volunteers and money are acquired from the environment. \r\n\r\n5. Interpretation of new information How new information is considered and how it ultimately becomes (or does not become) part of the core. New information can also include information about the organization. \r\n\r\n6. Maintenance of mental model (includes resource management) How the organization maintains its organizational integrity by consciously and unconsciously resisting change over time. \r\n\r\n7. Planning and plan execution How a campaign is initiated, carried out, and monitored. \r\n\r\n8. Modiﬁcation of mental model How the core itself is scrutinized by participants in the organization and modiﬁed. Another term for this is organizational learning. \r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of each of these processes will help determine the effectiveness of the entire organization. For that reason, it is important to develop surveys and other types of diagnostic tools that can help organizations use the civic intelligence paradigm effectively. This information could be key in evaluating actions or developing plans. Some of the other uses of this knowledge are inventorying civic intelligence initiatives of geographical regions or thematic activist areas, convening interorganizational workshops, designing curricula, planning campaigns, or even developing new organizations. One of the most important uses of this information is metacognition: examining and evaluating how the processes are used within an organization and changing them as necessary. \r\n\r\nThe physical, social, and intellectual environment is changing rapidly.

', 'In early 2003, days before the United States invaded Iraq, Robert Muller, former assistant secretary general of the United Nations, called attention to the incipient otential of the citizenry: ‘‘Never before in the history of the world has there been a global visible, public, viable, open dialogue and conversation about the very legitimacy of war’’ ( Twist 2003). He was describing the unprecedented movement that arose simultaneously in hundreds of places around the world. What this movement represents is the advent of an immensely powerful force. Muller called it a ‘‘merging, surging, voice of the people of the world.’’ And James Moore (2003), a multifaceted scholar, activist, and businessperson, called this same phenomenon the ‘‘second superpower’’ whose ‘‘beautiful but deeply agitated face . . . is the worldwide peace campaign,’’ and ‘‘the body of the movement is made up of millions of people concerned with a broad agenda that includes social development, environmentalism, health, and human rights.’’ Both are expressions of pent-up desire and a will to work for a better world, and both are manifestations of civic intelligence. \r\n\r\nTo meet the need for civic problem solving, governments, companies, nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs) citizens, and ordinary people are beginning to acknowledge the vast problems that humankind now faces and are devising new strategies, tactics, and paradigms to ameliorate them. To help with these daunting tasks, a growing array of sociotechnical information and communication systems is being developed. People and organizations need both general paradigms and speciﬁc ideas to help them devise tactics and strategies that further their objectives while working cooperatively with other people and organizations. \r\n\r\nCivic intelligence, like Daniel Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence (1995) or the various types of intelligences identiﬁed by Howard Gardner in Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983) (or even erotic intelligence, the cover story in a recent edition of the Utne Reader (September/October 2003)), is a type of intelligence, one with a speciﬁc focus; it can be used to explore and invigorate a ﬂexible and powerful competence that goes beyond the traditional notion of intelligence (which is typically equated to what IQ tests measure) in several important ways. Civic intelligence is a type of intelligence that focuses on the betterment of society as a whole, not just on individual aggrandizement. Moreover since it is a capability of society as a whole, its manifestation is collective and distributed throughout the population. The boundary between one person’s ‘‘intelligence’’ and another person’s ‘‘intelligence’’ is permeable, indistinct, and constantly shifting. Ideas in your mind today might be central to my understanding of the world tomorrow. How ‘‘intelligent’’ would one person be without interacting with other people directly (through discussion or argument) or indirectly (through reading books, watching television, or pondering works of art) or with the nonhuman world (observing nature, for example). \r\n\r\nCivic Intelligence builds on what we know about how people learn and maintain knowledge about the world and their place within it. Intelligent behavior in individuals is rich and multifaceted. It involves perception, monitoring, deliberating, remembering and forgetting, categorizing, coming up with new ideas and modifying old ones, negotiating and discussing, making decisions, testing hypotheses, and experimenting. Society as a whole engages in analogous activities, and these are embedded in our institutions, traditions, artifacts, and conversations. That these activities of collective intelligence exist is indisputable. Less obvious but also true is the fact that they are all subject to change. The idea that they could and should be consciously improved is the heart of this pattern. This recommendation is bolstered by the ﬁndings of Jared Diamond, the prominent historian and author at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has extensively studied how societies face challenges with potentially catastrophic consequences. Somewhat incredibly, Diamond’s research reveals that the ‘‘commonest and most surprising’’ of the four ways in which societies fail to address their problems is their ‘‘failure even to try to solve a problem that it has perceived,’’ even one that ultimately results in that society’s collapse. To avoid that mistake, we must go beyond examining how we as a society collectively think and take a critical look at how our knowledge and ideas are—and could be—channeled into actions. \r\n\r\nThe number of organizations exhibiting civic intelligence today is vast and growing. There were ten times more transnational advocacy organizations in 2000 then there were in 1900 ( Keck and Sikkink 1998). Not only are these organizations more numerous, but they are increasingly thoughtful and forward looking. While in the past, protest may have been simply opposed to something, it is not uncommon today for organizations to develop sophisticated analyses and policy recommendations. In an earlier exploration of civic intelligence (Schuler 2001), six dimensions were identiﬁed (orientation, organization, engagement, intelligence, products and projects, and resources) in which organizations and movements that demonstrate civic intelligence are likely to differ from those that do not. The set of attributes associated with those dimensions that tend to characterize civic intelligence organizations and movements is a ﬁrst approximation of a descriptive model of civic intelligence. Some notable examples (among tens of thousands) include the worldwide Indymedia network, the World Social Forum, the Global Fund for Women, Jubilee 2000, Science for the People, and New Tactics in Human Rights. Civic intelligence can also be manifested locally. The graphic at the beginning of the pattern, for example, shows how neighborhood art —in this case a mural about the causes and effects of asthma—can be educational and lead to political engagement and other proactive civic activities. Many of these efforts are of necessity holistic, multidisciplinary, and entrepreneurial since the people and organizations that the efforts would ideally engage with cannot necessarily be expected to do what might be considered the right thing.

Muller called it a ‘‘merging, surging, voice of the people of the world.’’ And James Moore (2003), a multifaceted scholar, activist, and businessperson, called this same phenomenon the ‘‘second superpower’’ whose ‘‘beautiful but deeply agitated face . . . is the worldwide peace campaign,’’ and ‘‘the body of the movement is made up of millions of people concerned with a broad agenda that includes social development, environmentalism, health, and human rights.’’ Both are expressions of pent-up desire and a will to work for a better world, and both are manifestations of civic intelligence. \r\n\r\nTo meet the need for civic problem solving, governments, companies, nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs) citizens, and ordinary people are beginning to acknowledge the vast problems that humankind now faces and are devising new strategies, tactics, and paradigms to ameliorate them. To help with these daunting tasks, a growing array of sociotechnical information and communication systems is being developed. People and organizations need both general paradigms and speciﬁc ideas to help them devise tactics and strategies that further their objectives while working cooperatively with other people and organizations. \r\n\r\nCivic intelligence, like Daniel Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence (1995) or the various types of intelligences identiﬁed by Howard Gardner in Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983) (or even erotic intelligence, the cover story in a recent edition of the Utne Reader (September/October 2003)), is a type of intelligence, one with a speciﬁc focus; it can be used to explore and invigorate a ﬂexible and powerful competence that goes beyond the traditional notion of intelligence (which is typically equated to what IQ tests measure) in several important ways. Civic intelligence is a type of intelligence that focuses on the betterment of society as a whole, not just on individual aggrandizement. Moreover since it is a capability of society as a whole, its manifestation is collective and distributed throughout the population. The boundary between one person’s ‘‘intelligence’’ and another person’s ‘‘intelligence’’ is permeable, indistinct, and constantly shifting. Ideas in your mind today might be central to my understanding of the world tomorrow. How ‘‘intelligent’’ would one person be without interacting with other people directly (through discussion or argument) or indirectly (through reading books, watching television, or pondering works of art) or with the nonhuman world (observing nature, for example). \r\n\r\nCivic Intelligence builds on what we know about how people learn and maintain knowledge about the world and their place within it. Intelligent behavior in individuals is rich and multifaceted. It involves perception, monitoring, deliberating, remembering and forgetting, categorizing, coming up with new ideas and modifying old ones, negotiating and discussing, making decisions, testing hypotheses, and experimenting. Society as a whole engages in analogous activities, and these are embedded in our institutions, traditions, artifacts, and conversations. That these activities of collective intelligence exist is indisputable. Less obvious but also true is the fact that they are all subject to change. The idea that they could and should be consciously improved is the heart of this pattern. This recommendation is bolstered by the ﬁndings of Jared Diamond, the prominent historian and author at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has extensively studied how societies face challenges with potentially catastrophic consequences. Somewhat incredibly, Diamond’s research reveals that the ‘‘commonest and most surprising’’ of the four ways in which societies fail to address their problems is their ‘‘failure even to try to solve a problem that it has perceived,’’ even one that ultimately results in that society’s collapse. To avoid that mistake, we must go beyond examining how we as a society collectively think and take a critical look at how our knowledge and ideas are—and could be—channeled into actions. \r\n\r\nThe number of organizations exhibiting civic intelligence today is vast and growing. There were ten times more transnational advocacy organizations in 2000 then there were in 1900 ( Keck and Sikkink 1998). Not only are these organizations more numerous, but they are increasingly thoughtful and forward looking. While in the past, protest may have been simply opposed to something, it is not uncommon today for organizations to develop sophisticated analyses and policy recommendations. In an earlier exploration of civic intelligence (Schuler 2001), six dimensions were identiﬁed (orientation, organization, engagement, intelligence, products and projects, and resources) in which organizations and movements that demonstrate civic intelligence are likely to differ from those that do not. The set of attributes associated with those dimensions that tend to characterize civic intelligence organizations and movements is a ﬁrst approximation of a descriptive model of civic intelligence. Some notable examples (among tens of thousands) include the worldwide Indymedia network, the World Social Forum, the Global Fund for Women, Jubilee 2000, Science for the People, and New Tactics in Human Rights. Civic intelligence can also be manifested locally. The graphic at the beginning of the pattern, for example, shows how neighborhood art —in this case a mural about the causes and effects of asthma—can be educational and lead to political engagement and other proactive civic activities. Many of these efforts are of necessity holistic, multidisciplinary, and entrepreneurial since the people and organizations that the efforts would ideally engage with cannot necessarily be expected to do what might be considered the right thing. In an interesting turn of events, the idea of collective intelligence, which is not necessarily aligned with civic intelligence (also a form of collective intelligence), is now receiving attention from various quarters. One group, the cyber pundits, are hoping it will be the ‘‘next big thing.’’ Tim O’Reilly (2006), publisher of O’Reilly books and the man who coined the expression ‘‘Web 2.0,’’ deﬁnes it as ‘‘the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform. ‘‘There is another side of this growing interest in collective intelligence as well. This approach is less concerned with making money and more about solving global problems. While these two groups have different aspirations, both of their revolutionary visions are generally based on side-effects or technical aspects, such as new algorithms, semantic webs, or tipping points. Both groups seem to place less faith in the value of collaboratively working together and thereby trying to address the problems that humankind is facing by actually addressing the problems.\r\n\r\nA complementary model (illustrated below and described in more detail at http://www.publicsphereproject.org/civint/model-functional.html) of civic intelligence that depicts its primary functional processes has also been proposed (Schuler 2001). This model (or framework) is an amalgam of concepts from social change theory and models of education and human learning. The model is aimed at providing useful exploration in these areas as opposed to offering an algorithm or mechanism that always behaves accurately and with the prescribed result. Generally the two models are to be used in tandem: the descriptive model describes the what, while the functional model describes the how.  The functional model contains three main components: the environment, which includes everything that is relevant to the organization yet outside the organization; the mental model (or core), which corresponds to the sum of knowledge that the organization uses; and the remaining constituents of the organization, including its resources (e.g., people) and, most important, the interactive processes under the control of the organization that link the environment and the mental model. The functional model contains eight types of interactive processes that a movement, organization, or other group exhibits when engaging in civic intelligence: \r\n\r\n1. Monitoring How the organization acquires new relevant information nonintrusively. \r\n\r\n2. Discussion and deliberation How organizations discuss issues and determine common agendas, ‘‘issue frames’’ ( Keck and Sikkink 1998), and action plans with other organizations. The mental model of any participants or the organization itself can change as a result of the interactions. \r\n\r\n3. Engagement How the organization attempts to make changes through varying degrees of cooperation and combativeness. \r\n\r\n4. Resource transfer How noninformational resources like volunteers and money are acquired from the environment. \r\n\r\n5. Interpretation of new information How new information is considered and how it ultimately becomes (or does not become) part of the core. New information can also include information about the organization. \r\n\r\n6. Maintenance of mental model (includes resource management) How the organization maintains its organizational integrity by consciously and unconsciously resisting change over time. \r\n\r\n7. Planning and plan execution How a campaign is initiated, carried out, and monitored. \r\n\r\n8. Modiﬁcation of mental model How the core itself is scrutinized by participants in the organization and modiﬁed. Another term for this is organizational learning. \r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of each of these processes will help determine the effectiveness of the entire organization. For that reason, it is important to develop surveys and other types of diagnostic tools that can help organizations use the civic intelligence paradigm effectively. This information could be key in evaluating actions or developing plans. Some of the other uses of this knowledge are inventorying civic intelligence initiatives of geographical regions or thematic activist areas, convening interorganizational workshops, designing curricula, planning campaigns, or even developing new organizations. One of the most important uses of this information is metacognition: examining and evaluating how the processes are used within an organization and changing them as necessary. \r\n\r\nThe physical, social, and intellectual environment is changing rapidly. Intelligence, more than anything else, describes the capacity to inﬂuence and adapt to its environment. Organizations with civic missions have the responsibility to keep their principles intact while interacting effectively with other organizations, both aligned with and opposed to their own beliefs and objectives. \r\n\r\n', 'An effective and principled civic intelligence is necessary to help humankind deal collectively with its collective challenges.

More recently, the country experienced a spurt in the literacy rate (7+). From 52.5% in 1991 it jumped to 65.4% in 2001, thanks to the Total Literacy Campaigns (TLCs) in around 450 of India\'s 593 districts, under the aegis of the National Literacy Mission (established in 1988).\r\n\r\nTable 1: Decadal literacy growth in India (7+ age group)\r\n\r\nYear;    Literacy (%);   Decadal Growth;   Non-literates (millions)\r\n1951;    18.3;           --;               --\r\n1961;    28.3;           10.0;             249.40\r\n1971;    34.4;           6.1;              283.03\r\n1981;    43.5;           9.1;              305.31\r\n1991;    52.5;           8.7;              328.88\r\n2001;    65.4;           12.9;             268.42\r\nSource: 2001 Census; Extrapolation in NLM (2000)\r\n\r\nThe TLCs successfully added around 100 million neo-literate people, bringing the early literate population to an estimated 300 million at present. Early literates are defined as people whose literacy skills are at risk of gradual erosion or ultimately relapse into non-literacy. Despite its success, the TLC can be critiqued for not planning adequately for the continued improvement of early literacy skills. The Post-Literacy Campaigns (PLCs) failed to enlist a majority of the neo-literates (NLM, 1994). As necessary as the activities under the recently launched Continuing Education (CE) scheme may be (NLM, 2000), their limitation to enhance the literacy skills of early literates on a national scale and in a sustained manner, needs to be recognized. The challenge in the Indian context is to infuse everyday life with inescapable literacy transactions. That is only possible with the mass media and supreme among them, is television with its reach and power to draw the masses.\r\n\r\nTelevision increasingly commands an overwhelming share of media presence in an average Indian household. According to the 2001 National Readership Survey, TV accounts for 72% of total media consumption, up from 62% in 1995 (Times of India, July 7, 2001). Nearly 500 million people in India already have access to television and this is growing rapidly. Of these, at least 150 million people may be considered to be early literate. Can television -- the most affordable ICT with the maximum penetration -- give reading practice to the masses of India\'s early literates, spread across 35 states, 640,000 villages, and speaking any (or none) of the 18 official languages? Overstated as it sounds, this is imminently possible with a powerful but extremely simple concept -- Same Language Subtitling (SLS).', 'Same Language Subtitling is well-suited to any context wherein:\r\na) there is a passion for watching music videos and/or film songs, folk songs, etc., on TV,\r\nb) song-based programming is already shown, and\r\nc) there is a need for reading skill improvement among viewers.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly the case all over India, including the high literacy state of Kerala.  The idea is also relevant, not just for other developing countries, but also for the developed world.  For instance, a recent survey of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2000) measuring the literacy levels in developed countries found that even in 14 of these 20 developed countries surveyed, \"at least 15 per cent of all adults have literacy skills at only the most rudimentary level, making it difficult for them to cope with the rising skill demands of the information age.\"\r\n\r\nThe context of SLS is thus global.', 'Same Language Subtitling (SLS)\r\n\r\nConcept\r\n\r\nSLS simply suggests subtitling all song-based programming on television, in the \"same\" language as the audio (Kothari 1998; Kothari 2000). Subtitles can change color to match the audio track exactly so that even a non-literate person is able to identify the word being sung, at any given time. The insatiable appetite for film-based entertainment, make film songs the ideal bed-fellow for SLS. Chitrahaar, the longest running film-song program on national television (Doordarshan), boasts\r\na viewership of 140 million people, mainly concentrated in rural areas. Thus, the simple addition of SLS to Chitrahaar would give regular reading practice to a staggering 140 million people, of whom, an estimated 80-100 million may be in need of reading skill enhancement.\r\n\r\nDoes SLS contribute to skill improvement?\r\n\r\nTwo research projects have shown that SLS contributes to reading skill improvement. In a controlled experiment with primary school children, greater improvement in reading skills was found in the group that saw subtitled songs as compared to the group that saw songs without subtitles (Kothari et al., 2001a; Kothari and Takeda, 2000). Subsequently, SLS was implemented in a natural setting. Chitrageet, a weekly Gujarati film song program was shown, with SLS, on state television in Gujarat (DDK, Ahmedabad). With a partially literate sample drawn from villages and city slums - not attending formal or non-formal education -- it was found that people who watched the subtitled Chitrageet regularly, showed greater improvement in reading skills than people who saw the program infrequently (Kothari et al., 2001b). The group differences in both the studies were statistically significant, implying consistent improvement across group members in the subtitled group. These results are noteworthy given the short-term exposure to subtitling. They confirm the contribution that SLS can make incrementally to literacy on a mass scale. As a lifelong process, this contribution could be substantial. Qualitative data through post-cards, obtained by the researchers and independently by DDK, were consistent in documenting not only the popularity of subtitled over unsubtitled songs, but also the use of SLS toward edutainment goals.\r\n\r\nBenefits of SLS\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of SLS can be deceptive in terms of the plethora of benefits that it packs. SLS does the following:\r\n· Raises the literacy skills of all early literates on a mass scale,  through lifelong practice. \r\n· Increases the frequency of literacy practices among: a) early literates not in school (children and adults), and ii) emergent literates in schools or literacy centers. \r\n· Motivates non-literates toward literacy, through entertainment and popular culture. \r\n· Makes reading an automatic and reflex phenomenon in everyday life. \r\n· Creates a reading culture and an environment for reading. \r\n· Increases the entire population\'s exposure to print (especially critical for pre-reading children).\r\n· A specific format in SLS programming can inform people about important social issues and generate thinking around these. \r\n· SLS also helps the deaf and hard of hearing by making television programming more accessible.\r\n· Meets the above objectives at an extremely low per person cost and can be economically sustainable approach.\r\n\r\nHow expensive is SLS?\r\n\r\nKothari (1999) argues that SLS is indeed a low cost solution. To illustrate, SLS of one Hindi film song program shown nationally on prime time, is expected to give 30 minutes of weekly reading practice to around 100 million partially literate people, at a cost of US$ 0.0065 per person per year. The basis for calculation is as follows:\r\n52 episodes x $12,500 per episode / 100,000,000 viewers, assuming that at least 100 million early literates in India have access to TV. The direct benefits to the hearing disadvantaged and the motivational impact on nearly 300 non-literates, further strengthen the already high return on investment.\r\n\r\nFilm to folk, reading to knowledge\r\n\r\nA pilot project is underway on DDK, Ahmedabad with some key differences from earlier efforts. SLS is added to a weekly folk song program (instead of film songs), called, Geet Tamara, Bol Amara (Your Songs, Our Lyrics). A competition is also conducted on the program. Two questions are asked on every episode, one based on the lyrics of any given song (to persuade people to read carefully) and a general question on an issue of social significance, such as, \"What is the minimum age of marriage, for girls?\" A winner is chosen by lottery from the correct responses received (by post) and a two-in-one player given away on every episode. All correct respondents receive a song lyrics poster of the episode. Preliminary assessments from a survey and content analysis of the post-cards strongly suggest that the first question does indeed encourage reading of the subtitles. More importantly, the second question is contributing to general thinking, awareness and discussion around the social issue sparked. The posters are being put in homes and public places. There are reports of school children using the posters as resource material for cultural programs and women taking them along to their bhajan mandalis or group singing sessions. \r\n\r\nWhy SLS works\r\n\r\nThat SLS has the potential to enhance literacy among early literates is echoed in several studies on the use of closed-captioning in second language learning and deaf education (e.g., Koskinen et al. 1986, Koskinen et. al 1985, Neuman and Koskinen 1992, Borras and Lafayette 1994, Carney and Verlinde 1987, Froehlich 1988, Lambert 1986, Bean and  Wilson 1989, Holobow et al. 1984, Vanderplank 1988 and 1990). Generally it is reported that closed-captioning contributes to second-language acquisition, reading improvement, listening comprehension development, vocabulary enrichment, and even speaking performance. However, these studies were conducted with fully literate people and that is one of the reasons why, SLS is a concept in virgin territory. The idea has never been tried in popular culture, for first language literacy, in a non-Roman script, on such a mass scale.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the effectiveness of SLS lie in the following:\r\n\r\n· SLS makes reading inescapable (d\'Ydewalle et al., 1991 have proven this point through sophisticated eye-ball tracking); creates automatic and reflex reading in everyday entertainment. \r\n· The idea builds on people\'s existing knowledge of lyrics, enabling early literates to anticipate the subtitles and read along \r\n· The inherent repetition in songs makes them ideal for practice. \r\n· SLS enhances the entertainment value of song-based programs, it is a win-win solution for entertainment and education. Literate people enjoy because they get to know/clarify the lyrics. \r\n· SLS is simple to implement given the existing and ever-growing resource of film songs. \r\n· SLS leverages film songs, a genre of programming already consumed in abundance on television. \r\n· A unique subtitling method has been developed, specifically for literacy improvement among early literates while also enhancing entertainment for all. \r\n· SLS offers a financially sustainable model for lifelong literacy skill improvement. \r\n· The scope for replicability in India with different languages is enormous.\r\n\r\nThe power of SLS lies in its leveraging of popular culture to make a nation the size of India, read. SLS also has relevance anywhere in the world where music-videos are enjoyed on TV and literacy skills are low, including pockets in the developed world.', '(In this case, it is difficult to separate the solution from the discussion.)\r\n\r\nSLS simply suggests subtitling all song-based programming on television, in the \"same\" language as the audio (Kothari 1998; Kothari 2000). Subtitles can change color to match the audio track exactly so that even a non-literate person is able to identify the word being sung, at any given time. The insatiable appetite for film-based entertainment, make film songs the ideal bed-fellow for SLS. Chitrahaar, the longest running film-song program on national television (Doordarshan), boasts a viewership of 140 million people, mainly concentrated in rural areas. Thus, the simple addition of SLS to Chitrahaar would give regular reading practice to a staggering 140 million people, of whom, an estimated 80-100 million may be in need of reading skill enhancement.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-08-08 02:41:15', '2006-09-14 07:40:20', NULL, NULL, 'Asst.

It describes a potential \"contract\" between an offering entity and a person looking for future possibilities.  Opportunities, of course, take many forms.  These can include classes and seminars, volunteer positions, jobs, contests, access to the media, timely announcements, mentoring, scholarships, grants and many others. \r\n\r\nOpportunities dictate the possible paths to the future that are available to people.

Such a group is bound together by the common concerns of a diverse membership, and those who feel underserved within the group may dissipate the efforts of the group or take their energies elsewhere. Building upon and integrating shared concerns into a shared vision helps members to focus their involvement in the group, so as to better orient their energies toward the collective enterprise.', 'A McKinsey report on nonprofits states that not-for-profit organizations have a special need for a vision as a means to guide their actions and evaluate outcomes. A compelling, easy-to-understand description of how the nonprofit would like the world to change in the next three-to-five years, what role the organization will play in that change, and how the nonprofit will measure the success of its role (Kilpatrick & Silverman, 2004, p. 3), the vision should pervade the organizations activities: an ultimate guide for making decisions and setting goals in alignment with collective values and aspirations.\r\n\r\nA vision should express values, purpose, and progress toward a better future. It should be neither too specific nor too general. Detailed goals, though necessary, do not belong in the vision itself; they easily become outdated, either once they are attained or when unforeseen opportunities and unexpected consequences occur. On the other hand, noble sentiments and statements of principle do not always easily translate into action under complex circumstances.\r\n\r\nA shared vision should be clear and compelling, aspirational for a better world in the future, and describable in simple terms. It should be capable of being understood as a common purpose, and of acting as a guideline for evaluating decisions and outcomes on a continuing basis. Nanus (1992) recommends that a vision be challenging but realistic, and developed by people throughout the organization.\r\n\r\nThe content of a shared vision is less important than the life it brings to the organization. Peter Senge quotes Robert Fritz that \"It\'s not what the vision is, it\'s what the vision does.\" (Scharmer, 1996, para. 30). A shared vision comes from the individual visions of group members; it becomes a force for action through the process of becoming shared. The difference between the shared vision and current reality should generate energy for change. Through its use, a shared vision should ensure that strategic decisions and specific goals are aligned with the organizations values.\r\n\r\nTo provide both accountability and allegiance to collective values and goals, a vision must be successfully put into practice. According to Etienne Wenger, \"One can design visions, but one cannot design the allegiance necessary to align energies behind those visions.\" (1998, p. 229); members allegiance can, however, be encouraged in the way a group or organization enacts a shared visionhow its members live out their accountability to collective values and goals. One way to promote allegiance to a vision is to use and communicate it constantly; another is to promote behavior, both inside and outside the organization, which is consistent with the vision.\r\n\r\nA shared vision lives constantly in tension with fast-changing and unpredictable circumstances. To pursue a vision while ignoring what is practical and relevant cannot sustain an organization, yet the vision is an essential guide to action through a succession of new circumstances and possibilities. Brinckerhoff (2003) believes that not-for-profit organizations should respond flexibly to external demands, while remaining in alignment with the collective purpose. By maintaining the shared vision, an organization learns not only how to do better, but also what better to do; The world changes, and so must the vision. (Nanus, 1992, p. 20).\r\n\r\nA shared vision helps to guide an individual project with specific tasks and finite lifespan (Christenson & Walker, 2004). Developed in conjunction with stakeholders both within and outside the project members (for example, developers, funders, and the community at large), it helps people make sense of the project plan and their contributions to it. An easily understood, inspiring, credible and challenging vision can create and sustain the alignment of members energies, their enthusiasm and allegiance to the group, and their accountability to shared values and specific goals.\r\n\r\nWhen a community or civic project first begins, participants may be highly enthusiastic, each with a strong conception of what the project should be. It is tempting to jump right in and assume that everybody shares the same vision. Proceeding from this ambiguous and contradictory beginning may lead to division and hard feelings within the group, and to unsound early decisions that become \"built-in\" to the system. \r\n\r\nDeveloping a shared vision may be the single most important task for the group to accomplish at the outset. Developing shared perspectives on both the vision and the process for enacting it are indispensable for success. Good communication is essential; face-to-face group meetings, brainstorming and other methods of envisioning a collective future provide a forum for dialogue which e-mail, for example, can not address adequately.\r\n\r\nSteve Cisler suggests the use of a spoked circle as a graphical decision aid to fine-tuning the vision. The circle represents the \"space\" of decisions and goals, and the endpoints of the spokes represent the two possible extremes of each decision. Cisler (1994) shows an example of the spoked-circle used by the Silicon Valley Public Access Link (SV-PAL) Project. The upright spoke, for example, might be labeled \"architecture\" and the location of the small circle on the spoke near the \"distributed\" endpoint depicts the decision to use a distributed architecture instead of a centralized one. A point on the middle of a spoke would indicate an intermediate position between the views represented by the endpoints.\r\n\r\nThere are no stringent requirements as to how to use the tool. Simply identifying the spokes can be an important first step, as the spokes clearly show which decisions are to be made. It may not be critical to determine the exact location of the spot indicating a decision. In some cases, a group may decide to postpone a decision, but it is a group decision, nevertheless, that ultimately must be made with others in the group. If it hadn\'t been resolved, for example, whether the network should be free to use or whether there should be fees, the organizers could say, \"We\'re still trying to resolve this. Which approach do you think is best?\" The tool can be used as a way to explain compromises or transitional circumstances by showing the current point in relation to the direction along which the developers plan to proceed. For example, when the system is launched it might be deemed necessary to charge users a small fee, but ultimately the system would be expected to be free to use.', 'Create, communicate, enact and maintain a shared vision.

These acts are kept hidden from those on the outside until such time as they are uncovered by somebody on the outside or exposed by somebody on the inside. The pressures on an \"insider\" to keep quiet about the transgression are immense.  Although society as a whole benefits from the new revelations, the whistle-blower is likely to be seen as a traitor to his or her community and punished heartily for his or her efforts; He or she could be shunned at work, fired, \"black-balled\" (denied employment in general in the future) , or, even, physically harmed.  Of course, even after it\'s revealed to the world, the damaging evidence can be ignored by the media or spun into irrelevance by the institution and its allies. \r\n\r\nIn a section called \"Blowing the Whistle Wisely\", Devine discusses \"basic survival strategies\" which are listed below. <ol><li>Before taking any irreversible steps, talk to your family or close friends about your decision to blow the whistle.</li><li>Develop a plan so that your employer is reacting to you, instead of vice-versa.</li><li>Be alert and discretely attempt to learn of any other people who are upset about the wrongdoing.</li><li>Before formally breaking ranks, consider whether there is any reasonable way to work within the system by going to the first level of authority.</li><li>Maintain good relations with administrative and support staff.</li><li><em>Before and after</em> you blow the whistle, it is very important to protect yourself by <em>keeping a careful record of events as they unfold.</em></li><li>Identify and copy all necessary supporting records before drawing any attention to your concerns.</li><li>Research and identify potential allies such as elected officials, journalists or activists who have proven their sincerity and can help expose the wrongdoing.</li><li>Either invest the funds for a legal opinion from a competent lawyer, or talk to a non-profit watchdog organization about the risks and obstacles facing you.</li><li>Always be on guard not to embellish your charges.</li><li>Engage in whistleblowing initiatives on your own time and with your own resources, not your employer\'s.</li><li>Don\'t wear your cynicism on your sleeve when working with authorities.</li></ol>\r\nWhistle blowing arises within government institutions as well as commercial concerns and, as a matter of fact, has some degree of legal protection &mdash; at least in some  countries. One of the most important examples of government abuse include corruption, violation of human rights (by allowing torture, for example) or by hiding decisions, such as a decision to start a war while publicly asserting that peace is being sought.  Some connect the concept of protecting whistle blowers with free speech rights secured by the 1st Amendment of the Constitution.  Beyond a rights context, government transparency is necessary for a healthy democracy, in that accurate and timely information is vital for informed policy-making.\r\n\r\nThis pattern connotes the use of a whistle, as in the whistle of a police officer, to signal for help.

In some cases it will be important to come up with new expressions in other languages to talk about the concept!

A major part of that effort is spent making computing facilities available to everybody in the community, especially, those without ready access to the technology.\" - Schuler (1996).\r\n\r\nMany agree that \"there is no such thing as a poor community. Even neighbourhoods without much money have substantial human resources. Often, however, the human resources are not appreciated or utilized, partly because people do not have information about each other and about what their neighbourhood have to offer\". - Resnick and King (1990).\r\n\r\nIn most developing countries physically challenged people (cripples, blind men/ women, amputees, for example, are only good for begging, at least that is what their circumstances force them to be. This is a very sad state of affairs in that these under-priviledged brothers and sisters could otherwise have become Doctors, Lawyers, Researchers, Lecturers, Architects, Designers, Computer Scientists, Social Scientists, etc. How can we harness computer technology to the advantage of all? We can address this by taking pragmatic steps to ensure that no one (male or female, strong or weak, rich or poor, young or old, etc.) is left out of the game. Disabled people will no longer be cut off from opportunities when computers and Internet are accessible to them. They can access educational opportunities and resources online. It would also be possible for them to connect to people in similar circumstances within and outside their communities and share experiences.\r\n\r\nOne of the most nagging problems facing developing countries is rural-urban migration and brain drain. The rural communities are not attractive to the youth owing largely to lack of opportunities (good schools, good jobs, health care, recreation, etc.). Workers ( doctors, nurses, teachers, etc.) are reluctant to take up appointments when posted to such communities. Those who brave the odds and go get frustrated by the system and eventually leave. At the national level, developing countries are again faced with the problem of brain drain. The trained and skilled work force find it conducive \"fleeing\" to developed countries largely in search of better opportunities. Community networks if carefully planned and implemented, have the potential of curbing this worrying trend.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations and other organisations have embarked on several projects aimed at bringing ICT to citizens of developing countries. The government of Ghana, for instance, (as well as governments in developing countries) recognises the importance of ICT to national development. However, years after Ghanas ICT policy implementation we are yet to realise concrete gains at the grassroots.\r\n\r\nStudents, even at the tertiary level, do not have access to computers and therefore we cannot talk about Internet access to any significant degree. The Computer room is still part of our vocabulary and these rooms are treated like shrines which have to be visited at scheduled times during the academic semester or year, depending on which course you are on. Computer contact for students is treated more or less as part of a module of an academic course. Students still access both computers and the Internet through privately owned Internet cafes on campuses for a fee. The fees are such that they cannot spend quality time on the Internet (sometimes so irritatingly slow). Students even get charged to use Microsoft applications like Word. Sometimes the cafes charge students for value-added services like typing out documents in Word and Excel and also doing graphs in Excel where the student does not know how to use the particular application.\r\n\r\nSetting up Community Networks as a tool to facilitating national development should be critically regarded by governments of developing countries as well as international funding agencies/ institutions concerned about economic and social development in developing countries. Citizens of developing countries would have the option to remain in their own countries and still pursue foreign degrees through distant learning. The current situation is that because there are limited higher education opportunities in developing countries, most people are forced to travel to developing countries for further studies where they are made to pay exorbitant fees. Most students from developing countries studying abroad have to endure harsh economic conditions despite their restricted circumstances as international students.\r\n\r\nCommunity Networks hold the key to national development because they can\r\n· facilitate the transfer of knowledge\r\n· foster exchange of information and ideas\r\n· empower civil society and engender good and democratic governance\r\n· foster and deepen formal and informal learning\r\n· create awareness of community opportunities and potentials\r\n· enhance the interaction of the community with the outside world\r\n· market the community and its potentials to the outside world\r\n· foster the convergence of community efforts\r\n· etc.\r\n\r\nCommunity networking , in my opinion, is one of the most pragmatic approaches to bridging the digital gap.', 'The objective of setting up community networks cannot be said to have been realized unless it is truly accessible to all within the community, regardless of race, color, age, level of education, social status, physical ability, income level, etc.\r\n\r\nCommunity networks cannot work in isolation of other activities going on within the communities they are found. They need to be linked to, for instance, the economic, social, cultural, political, and religious activities to sustain the interest and patronage of the community participants.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that:\r\n\r\n1. Governments in developing countries should, as a matter of urgency embark on an exercise to make computers and Internet freely and publicly accessible at certain key centres within any given community. \r\n\r\n2. The government should also ensure that certain basic community services and information are available and accessible publicly via the Internet.\r\n\r\nThese two broad objectives can be achieved by the following:\r\n\r\n·	Each identifiable community (e.g., electoral zone) should have a public library equipped with computers with Internet access;\r\n·	Equipping all public libraries with computers and making sure that these computers are connected to the Internet;\r\n·	Equipping all school libraries (primary to tertiary) with computers with Internet connections;\r\n·	Ensuring that all teachers and lecturers are accessible via e-mail\r\n·	Ensuring all course related material or information is available on the Internet;\r\n·	There should be computer pools with Internet access open 24 hours on university campuses;\r\n·	Public institutions like hospitals and clinics should be accessible via the Internet and patients should be able to alternatively consult their Doctors via the Internet and book appointments\r\n\r\nOperational Policies\r\n· Advanced booking policy  people can walk in to use the systems however priority should be given to those who have booked in advance where they are fewer computers than users at any given time.\r\n· Members of that given community must be registered before they can use the system however a guest account should be created for non-community members.\r\n· Maximum usage time allocation - to ensure fair use when there are more people than computers at any given time\r\n\r\nEvery effort must also be made to sustain community networks after they have been successfully implemented.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-08-14 13:43:34', '2006-09-13 12:29:33', NULL, NULL, 'CPSR Africa', NULL, 18, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

An approach is required that makes use of situations in the life of citizens and offers guidance on different levels of system design. The result should be a process description of how to construct flexible and open MIS. This raises the following questions:\r\n·	How does one select content (including informational texts, applications and references to services offered elsewhere), and how is the process of content collection organised?\r\n·	What are the principles for the user-interface and the dialogue design?\r\n·	How must the system architecture be structured to be as flexible as necessary?\r\nFrom the perspective of software development these questions can be formulated as questions concerning the design of a MIS. With regard to content selection, an editorial process needs to be supported. Both system and software need to support editorial work on the content and on the special design of Situations in Life. The user-interface must be so designed that a user can collect and annotate information gathered. The dialogue design must enable users to easily switch between informational parts of the system and applications and personalised pages. The seamless transfer from synonymous to pseudonymous access must be possible ensuring data protection. Thus, the system?s architecture design must provide flexibility in terms of content types and combination, flexible generation of pages and the possibility to store user-related information in a secure area.', 'The social sciences in Germany have coined the term ?Lebenslagen?, which can be translated as ?Situations in Life?. This term is used for analysing citizens? perspective while getting in contact with the authorities. Situations in Life denominates a certain situation in the life of a person or a family. Common examples are ?Marriage?, ?Birth?, ?Death?, ?Moving house?, ?Unemployment? etc. They are used to reflect the needs of a person in a given situation.\r\nIn contrast with other approaches it is important from our point of view that a Situation in Life contains the following salient features:\r\n·	Time\r\n·	Planning and Acting\r\n·	Reification in a Checklist\r\nIt lasts for a certain length of time and guides actions in that respect. ?Birth? for example, as a Situation in Life includes all activities from medical care, diet plans, collecting diverse information to buying necessary goods, etc. This, of course, also includes, but is not limited to, activities that are authority-related, like birth certificate and nationality statement. The time constraint is important for the notion of what a Situation in Life is. Thus, ?marriage? can be regarded as a Situation in Life but ?going out tonight? is not. \r\nAdditionally, during that period of time, planning work and activities alternate. People collect actions and start to manage them. At the same time, they perform a number of actions with respect to the current Situation in Life. This planning work is usually done with a checklist that is completed every time a new topic arises. Tasks already performed are marked as done, others are grouped or assigned. Depending on the situation, a checklist can grow up to more than 100 items.\r\nThis notion of a checklist may or may not be embodied by a real checklist. The important aspect is that a communicative process is initiated in such a situation. First of all, one gathers tasks to do and information needed. Other persons may suggest things typically done in that kind of situation, and depending on certain factors a shared understanding of ?what to do? exists. Factors for such a shared understanding depend on ? but are not limited to ? region, religion, social status, and ethnic membership. \r\nNeither is the order of items on the checklist predefined nor is their order of execution fixed. Both heavily depend on personal preferences and the environment. Many tasks are performed situated and cannot be formalised. The important aspect of the checklist therefore is its collection of relevant tasks and topics rather than a workflow description.\r\nWith these characteristics of Situations in Life we feel confident that this is a useful concept in user-oriented software design and which is therefore transferred to systems design.

This creative use makes the technology and its use to evolve and develop. While creative use is something associated with active and engaged users, it poses severe problems for the design of public systems. With creative users it becomes almost impossible to predict the use of a system. For the designer the creative user is an unpredictive and unreliable user who will use the system in non-intended ways -- sometimes detrimental to the overall functionality and robustness of the system. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately this often lead designers to create closed systems with restricted opportunities for  user actions outside the intended. This approach however leads to systems not attractive to the creative and imaginative public who want to have ownership and possibility to develop their system in the way they find appropriate.', 'Unintended use exists where ever open and designable technolgy is used. People have a tendency to use any system in a creative way as long as the design of the technology allows it. Internet and related technology is, so far, a system and a technology based on an idea and infrastructure supporting unintended use. We are every day, still, surprised by new and inventive usage of the net.\r\n\r\nEven though the internet has changed over time the basic foundation still prevails. It is a technology well fitted for large open communities, that gives people (users) a  lot of freedom in the way they relate and use the technology. This technological foundation can be exploited for creative user driven design.', 'A successful tool is one that was used to do something undreamed of by its author.  -- S. C. Johnson\r\n\r\nThere are many observations, both scientific and anecdotical, that describes how people use technology in unintended ways. Studies show that this happens within organizational settings as well as on the open web. However, the domating idea is still that a design of a technology for a community should be done in such a way that it is obvious how to use the technology, that it should be userfriendly, etc. Studies have shows that such systems in many cases leaves the user with a feeling of being only a user (or even customer) of a community system and not a participant (Ciborra, 1992; Carroll & Rosson, 1987). \r\n\r\nInstead of seeing unintended use as a problem, it is possible to define it as a resource and instead of design to \"protect\" the system for creative use, design the system to support and be able to withstand creative use. A system that can handle uninteded use will be well equipted to evolve over time and to be updated and thereby relevant to the users in the community.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to design for unintended use, we have to study how people (users) deal with and approach technology at hand in everyday life, rather than focusing on what they do when they use it in a \"correct\" way. Creative unintended use is and will always be context- and situation-specific, and it will probably not be possible to produce abstractions in a way that subsequently can be used to produce general knowledge or concise design principles. \r\n\r\nThe important thing, however, is to find out how people understand, imagine and approach  technology. Since internet technology is designable, community support systems can never be moved from one community to another without being changed. This means that a tool or a specific use that is copied will not work the same way in two different places. The tool has to be redesigned. The most important knowledge question is, therefore, what kind of knowledge and understanding of the technology is needed to create a good foundation for that kind of context specific redesigns.\r\n\r\nA community is always changing. People develop new needs and wants. The technology for supporting such a community must build on the idea of \"unintended use\". Unintended use is not a threat to the supporting system, instead unintended use has to be understood as a creative driving force. Creative unintended use is a way for users to \"take control\" of the technology, to make it relevant to them. Unintended use is necessary in a community support system - not a problem.', 'The solution is to intentionally design for creative unintended use. Design principles for creative unintended use can be formulated and used to inform new designs (Stolterman, 2001). Some examples of such principles are: (1) that the system has to be robust to withstand creative use attacks from users, (2) the system should also be \"forgiving\", which means that it has some ability to accept creative use changes without demanding complete safety, (3) the system, whose purpose is to evoke creative and radical use, must also present a sufficiently rich, inspiring, and complex environment, (4) and also provide the user with tools for exploration and change of the system itself, (5) the system should also be designed as an open system, i.e., make it possible for users to expand the scope and breadth of the system without demanding to much formality and admiinistartion. This set of design principles are only some high-level principles that should be further developed and expanded. In the design for unintended use there is a need for experimental approaches that is relevant for the situation at hand.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-09-09 08:45:55', '2007-03-18 16:21:28', NULL, NULL, 'Indiana University', NULL, 30, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

It is political, philosophical, and economic, above all. John Perry Barlow argues that information must be treated differently from real estate, simply because the latter is tangible and physical, while the former, ostensibly, is not.  The science fiction writer and copyright militant K. W. Jeter, to the contrary, compares intellectual property digitized on the wire with cattle [dispersed] across grazing land on the American frontier: both forms of property are widely dispersed and therefore easier to steal than fixed goods, and consequently both need to be protected by especially strong sanctions.  For Barlow, technology determines how we define private property. But for Jeter, it is struggles over property rights that determine which technologies we develop in the first place. The same technological innovations that make widespread copying of digital patterns possible, also make it possible to tag and encrypt every instance of those very digital patterns, thus making copying harder rather than easier. In the last analysis, Jeter says, the laws of economics are as immutable as those of physics.  He seems to mean by this that, despite our supposed information glut, the creation of intellectual property is still subject to the constraints of scarcity and Malthusian competition. For if stuff is worth buying and sellingnot just hard physical stuff, but intellectual property as wellthen it is worth stealing, too.  Economic rationality is the bottom line for Jeter, just as it is for Marxists and free-marketeers alike. Appropriately, then, the biggest problem in Jeters argument is a matter of economics as well. Intellectual property rights ought to work in the same way at all levels of the economy: the same rule of survival applies to big international corporations, to midlevel localized players and entrepreneurs, to scrabbling, scribbling little content creators.  But in the real world, can such an equivalence really be made? I will suggest that it cannot, because, in our heavily networked society, private individuals do not have the same rights as multinational corporations. \r\nSITE OF STUDY: These issues will be teased out both philosophically and pragmatically, by looking both at the theoretical texts I have mentioned (Jeter, Barlow, etc) and a variety of practices on the Net (file sharing software like Napster and Gnutella, and stealth programs designed to track and identify copyright violators).', 'The only way to find a solution is to avoid simplistic panaceas, and bring critical thought to bear upon these dilemmas. It is as mistaken to believe that technology can be judged from outside, as it is to believe that technology can resolve all difficulties on its own.

Without improved access, NGOs will never achieve the full potential promised by the deployment of state-of-the-art, mission-focused, Internet technologies. Mission-driven NGO technology is at risk of forever being relegated to being generations behind the for-profit sector, consisting of obsolete, inefficient, and incompatible tools.', 'Social source software development methodology consists of three components:\r\n1.

For example, two major food banks might build an internal management system to track donors, supplies and outcomes. A version of the software that meets one partner\'s requirements might cost $100,000. A version of the software that meets two partners requirements might cost $150,000. By using collaborative software development strategies, each organization has saved $25,000 that they can use to feed people, rather than software vendors.\r\n\r\nSoftware communities allow ICT solutions to develop, emerge and evolve according to the needs of the community. If a number of food banks form a community, they can find partners for collaborative software projects, they can take existing software and extend it to serve unmet needs, and they can share the best practices that underlie their ICT solutions.\r\n\r\nThe social source methodology can be employed in a variety of contexts:\r\n\r\n1. Sector-wide .NGO platform\r\nSince much of the core technology required to build web-based, mission-driven  ICT solutions for the NGO sector is common-- authentication, permissions, synication, content management, personalization, etc.-- a social source methodology could be used to build the technological underpinning of major web-based NGO applications. For example, and online community, community networking, and food bank management application could be build on a common .NGO platform. Each application uses the same shared components like authentication.\r\n\r\n2. Specific NGO sectors\r\nSpecific NGO sectors like food banks, information & refferal organizations, etc. might band together to build social source ICT solutions for their sector. Thought they may not achieve the same economies of scale as a sector-wide effort, they still achieve cost reduction and expansions in functionality. \r\n\r\n3. Vendor-Customer Relationships\r\nSince most of the NGO sector does not have the capacity to develop software, they rely on requests for proposals (RFPs) and commercial software vendors. The social source development model does not require changes to this model, the NGO simply adjusts their RFP to reflect the requirements of social source development.', 'Most NGOs already use the principles of social source development in their day-to-day operations.\r\n\r\n**Open Source**\r\nSocial purpose organizations continually distribute best practices and evaluation data to one another.

Also, without structure, a discussion can become random and rambling. It can be dominated by powerful individuals or other factors. The emergence of these negative group dynamics can adversely impact the ability of the group to achieve it\'s shared objectives. Other factors, such as distance to the meeting, inconvenient scheduling, or costs of getting to the meeting can obstruct effective and inclusive participation. Current online systems don\'t provide the structure that groups of people engaging in deliberative meetings or discussions need to help them efficiently move through a decision making process that is accessible and ensures equal participation by all.', 'Board meetings, committee meetings, administrative panels, review boards, volunteer organizations, non-profit community groups.', 'Everyday conversation, though often purposeful, is informal; it doesn\'t rely on an agenda, defined  roles, or precisely delineated rules of interacton. To overcome the unpredictabilty of this type of human interaction, systematic rules have been created to facilitate purposeful group meetings whose objective is to produce collective decisions. One of the earliest set of \"parliamentary procedures\" was formulated in 1876 by Henry Robert in a treatise entitled \"Roberts Rules of Order\". \"Roberts Rules\", as they have come to be known, have been widely adopted as a means to fairly and equitably conduct the business of group meetings and provide a method to ensure that all parties within the group have the opportunity to participate in the decision making process. At the same time Roberts Rules ensure that no minority interest can exert undue influence on the process. \r\n\r\nThe advent of the Internet has provided an opportunity to combine the democratic principles (such as Roberts Rules of Order), with modern interactive communication technologies, to provide new web-based meeting facilitation systems. Ideally, online deliberations systems would allow people to come together as peers in an \"on-line\" environment and conduct \"official\" business meetings without being present in the same physical location. The plethora of online <i>discussion</i> systems, especially when contrasted to the scarcity of deliberative systems suggests the difficulty of this enterprise.\r\n\r\nWhile working in and with a team of students at The Evergreen State College the authors of this pattern were involved in the development of <i><a href=\" http://trout.cpsr.org/program/sphere/e-liberate/about.php\">e-Liberate</a></i> a working prototype devloped using Linux, MySql, Apache, and PHP. The application provides facilities to create groups and to create and schedule meetings. Then, using written (typed) rather than spoken input, the system facilitates meeting by coordinating user interactions (such as making motions), conducting and tallying votes, and providing an archive facility for official minutes.\r\n\r\nOnline deliberation substitutes one set of advantages and disadvantages for the set that face-to-face deliberation offers. In general the broad criteria of either approach include access to the process, efficacy of the process (including individual involvement and process as a whole, and the context (including legal requirements, etc.). Of course these criteria overlap to some degree and influence each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough face-to-face deliberation is basically \"low-tech,\" physically getting to meetings may involve costly, \"high-tech\" travel. Then, once physically present at a face-to-face meeting, effective participation depends on the skills (including, for example, how to use Roberts Rules of Order), intentions and knowledge of the individuals. It also depends (of course!) on the skills, intentions and knowledge of the other participants in the meeting &mdash; including the chair. \r\n\r\nBy making access to a computer (connected to the Internet) a prerequisite to participation online deliberation adds an access hurdle comprised of cost, geography, and computer fluency. Depending on the characteristics of the potential attendees this barrier may be more than offset by the <i>advantages</i> that online deliberations could provide. If, for example, the meeting attendees are drawn from western Europe and the United States, it is likely the case that costs associated with computer communication will be less than transportation costs. As a matter of fact, online deliberation makes the prospect of more-or-less synchronous discussions / deliberations among people  <i>around the world</i> possible, although here the tyranny of time zones and humankind\'s intrinsic circadian rhythms (which encourage us to sleep at night and stay awake in the daylight hours) become a mitigating factor: making decisions while many of the attendees are sleeping is one formula for dysfunctional meetings. The very fact that worldwide meetings become possible however provides an enormously fertile ground for civil society opportunities. (See, for example, the World Citizen Parliament pattern.) \r\n\r\nKnowledge of the topics under discussion, knowledge of the process (Roberts Rules of Order, for example) and command of the language(s) being used in the discussion can also be obstacles to effective and equitable face-to-face as well online deliberation. Online environments, however, have the potential of alleviating, at least to some degree, some of the disadvantages that seem to be intrinsic to face-to-face settings. In the e-Liberate example mentioned above attendees can select a \"language pack\" so that the appropriate Roberts Rules process word or phrase (such as \"I second the motion\") will be presented in the attendee\'s own language. Note that this is not machine (\"on-the-fly\") translation. Moreover it has no bearing whatsoever on the <i>content</i> of the meeting &mdash; what the participants actually contributed &mdash; it determines only which of several equivalent language sets of the Roberts Rules \"meta-language\" is displayed to each user. The possibility for automatic \"machine translation\" to be put to work on all attendee input so that attendee only saw input to the meeting in their own language. Of course machine translation is imperfect at best &mdash; and may always remain so. Try, for example, transforming some verbiage into another language and back again via a machine translation system on the web. The result generally bears no resemblance to the original. On the other hand, translation by humans is not perfect either; relying as it does on the skills of the human translator. For those reasons it may be well-advised for reasons of transparency and integrity of the process to make both (or all) original and machine-translated language versions available for inspection with the other meeting contributions in the database. (Today as I write this a transcript of an interview with me appeared in a Sao Paulo newspaper: my utterance \"couldn\'t\" was transcribed as \"could\" &mdash; an easy mistake that totally inverts the meaning!) So, while free and reliable electronic translation is desirable, high-quality human translation could be inserted into the process as appropriate. This could only be as \"simultaneous\" and as accurate as the skills and availability of the human translator interposed within the process would allow. The needs discussed above for multiple versions and for long-term storage are appropriate in the case of human translation as well. \r\n\r\nThe online environment offers other potential advantages. One obvious benefit is that only the actions that are allowable within the deliberation process at that time are displayed to the individual participants. This, in theory, can help reduce problems that are commonplace with meeting attendees who are not thoroughly familiar with the Roberts Rules conventions). Online systems can also provide onliine \"help systems.\" Within e-Liberate, for example, users can view descriptions of how and when specific actions are used. Also, as previously mentioned, a meeting transcript can be automatically created and votes can automatically be tabulated as well. \r\n\r\n<b>Notes:</b> <ul><li>Of course deliberation is an ongoing process &mdash; not just a sporadic occurrence. Should this fact be made explicit in the pattern? I.e. is the title (unqualified) misleading?

This team is coached by a project volunteer versed in government budgeting and has access to an online help center. The team meets (online) and assigns tasks. Essentially, each team must contact the official in charge of their assigned government unit and interview them about their budget. The team eventually posts their analysis, questions and recommendations on the project page. In this way the entire city budget will be scrutinized and annotated. All teams will be invited to a Peoples Budget Congress where spokespeople for each team will make a brief statement. \r\n\r\nAdditional components of the \"We Are Watching\" project would be graphical interface databases that would allow users to easily see which groups gave how much money to their elected representatives.\r\n\r\nThe second component of this project would be a hardware and ISP provisioning service that would supply participating organizations with PCs and Internet access at reduced rates.

G-strings, gravity strings, a new twist.\r\n\r\nYesterday left this reply at first google.com hit for << \"gravity strings\" graviton>>:\r\n\r\n<<I\'ve been thinking and studying this for years, concluded (heuristically speaking)that very dense , maybe 22 or so dimensional threads connect all matter within the ith level (zero to K levels) from the original \"cosmonium\" (original black hole, a triplet)to todays masses. \r\n\r\nDimulth (spelling?), nobel prize winner (about ten years ago-Science) for oscillating a positron at about 60 megacycles in a magnetic field and vacummn for a month to measure the gyromagnetic ratio out to 16 places and conclued the electron itself is a triplet with each 1/3 charge subquark having an energy ten billion times what we sense from the triplet, mater and anti-matter, etc, originating from a cosmonuium triplet, each 1/3 itself dividing into thirds, and so forth to today\'s sense of touch, like the keys I typing on now.   Mind blowing, not a well appreciated idea, but very powerful.) \r\n\r\nNow, consider that a photon emitted from a local electron dropping from an outer orbit to an inner causes a g-string connected to some where, another mass outside (where it is likely to end up) causes the g-string to loop and launch at speed of light (locally) at right angles to the g-string (think of the Bohr atom model) so as to give the observed emmission frequency. \r\n\r\nThe Maxwell electro-magnetic equations can be viewed as still working, a kind of \"ether\" as Maxwell himself envisioned, but using the g-strings (maybe some ten to the 58th power of them from each i-th level, where the observer is,to  connected all masses we can observe and more).   This is an exciting idea.\r\n\r\nWorking on this visually, the mathematics is difficult (beyond my abilities), so I concentrate on the linear verbal (like you) and visual models.  This is fun, it\'s got some neat references, contact me for more, best on your efforts.  roger muldavin>>\r\n\r\n If you have gotten through this verbal visual description, there is a lot of work to do to check the idea out.  Interesting since the graviton \"particle\" has not been found and further checking of NASA\'s great work with near 350 K years from iniitial expansion computer modeling. The idea that there are these very large numbers of \"invisible\" g-strings connecting each \"fundamental\" mass may seem beyond comprehension or individual measurement is not worth thinking about, it appeals to me as no less comprehensible than the apparent misunderstanding about the speed of light being a constant.  I keep reminding myself that Einstien appears to be sticking to the observer\'s frame of reference.  \r\n\r\nWhat\'s going on outside our \"laboratory\", test bench, is an informed guess.Especially NASA\'s comments about the expanding shell that keeps the photon energy contained, this makes the triplets as triangles attractive, at some radius letting the photons escape, and for smaller radii, maybe with photons as \"vibrating\" g-strings in some other resonating form. \r\n\r\nThis Cleveland Public Library is a great place (where I hang out for a break while my wife, Jean, is recovering from her second hip transplant-we leave for back home tommorrow), so many diverse people using almost every one of the internet computers on the many buildings and floors, a university for the people.

Yes, thanks again to Roger Penrose and others in \"tile math\", and to Nobel Prize winner Diehmult (sp) that electrons are flat triplets.\r\n\r\nSmolin experimental suggestion for testing the assertion that higher frequencies of gamma pulses (blue greater than red) may be different in time to arriving here at our instruments on earth (or \"our\" extensions via satilites) is needing a test.\r\n\r\nOk, Albert Einstein used math and his talents to local events to get a double deflection of the light from a distant star, one that passes behind our sun.  \r\n\r\nResults:  Twice the Newtonian defelection.  \r\n\r\nSo start our model on the Newtonian sphere with gravity strings radiating out as maybe some central \"point\".  \r\n\r\nSo what is needed here is a dynamic network (as Lee Smolin states) maybe feedback (local) assumed by we observers at the laboratory table, here at earth, an assumption operating at the \"percieved\" place and time of the \"object\" being \"tracked\".  \r\n\r\nIt appears to me that many writers recognize this.  The recent PBS two hour or more presentation on string theory \"The Elegant Universe\" with author Greene as tour guide  shows graphics, a net going into screen, a central sphere, the net sinks when the larger central sphere drops.  But, one graphics show the strings of the net going into the screen pulsing, there is color to this, and my reaction to seein this was this: why not the g-strings running and between spheres?\r\n\r\nThrough \"feedback\" mathematics, my engineering training tells to me, another dimension is added to the input (here along the g-string) to the \"output\" at some minimal time later. Thus from linear to second order curves, the conics of classical intersecting lines rotating to make two comes, and planes intersecting, tracing out on the flat projections, the shadows, of the curves.  So we have less variables, but that\'s less confusing for as long a you can afford the lack of a way to make the physics conversational. \r\n\r\nThe energy traveling along as the pulsed gamma, along a g-string, we\'ve got a choice, (1) something \"hammers\" inside some mass on the a very fine g-string end, a \"compression\" pluse travels down, you guess it\'d , speed of light?, or (2) the gamma pulse, let\'s save a lot of power requirements, and somehow \"wag\" or cycle the g-string (apologies to Sigmund Freud and the Viennia Circle discussions), with\r\n\r\n(A) music: start with the peg on the rotating wheel, the shadow on the wall from the flickering light,  Or, here\'s the one I\'m pushing now, \r\n\r\n(B) the mathematical \"gamma function\" (g-f), it\'s neat aspect is that the slope of it\'s curve is the same shape as the curve itself.\r\n\r\nFor a g-f, as has been reported maybe two years ago, \"we\" can get the shape of the g-f as soon as it is detectable after being directed into (input) a near \"absolute zero temperature\" metal, a Boise-Einstien (B-E) region, out of the other end (output).\r\n\r\nThis gives the input shape at the output before it peaks upon entry into the input, this has some nice features: \r\n\r\ng-f into B-E gives information before energy peaks.

This pattern urges cyberculture critics to move beyond analysis and to begin to discuss practical solutions for minority identity-representation in cyberspace.', 'In the virtual world, the normative participant is still white, heterosexual, male, and English speaking.  But unlike face-to-face interaction, cybercommunication creates a \"white, male curtain\" of presumption that nonwhite, queer, and female persons must deliberately throw open to reveal their \"nonstandard\" identities.  Such revelations are often viewed by white, straight, or male cybernauts as \"eruptions of funk,\" with a jarring and often unpleasant effect in white-, het-, or male-dominated net environments, particularly since in text-only environments (chat rooms, MOOs, irc) race and gender have to be mentioned repeatedly in order to continuously manifested.  This presumption of normative identity is sometimes convenient for nonwhite, queer, or female netizens, and is akin to the phenomenon of face-to-face \"passing\" (blacks light enough to \"pass\" for whites, women who look \"masculine\" enough to pass for male, gays who \"look straight\"), except that in face-to-face interaction passing is possible only for a very small percentage of nonwhites or women (queers are an exception -- only a small percentage can not \"pass\"), while in cyberspace everyone \"passes\" unless they elect to manifest nonwhiteness, femaleness or queerness. Initially regarded as liberatory, the presumption of white maleness has grown burdensome to many nonwhites, queers and women since the mere mention of their \"otherness\" often evokes hostile reactions in net environments. In addition, in normative cyberspace, there is a likelihood that there are more identity tourists representing, for example, Asian women, than there are actual body-identified Asian women in the group.  This means that the \"real\" Asian women are constantly in competition with the masqueraders in the struggle to represent themselves and their interests. The exhausting and sometimes futile effort of continuous representation against the norm and against the stereotypes employed by identity tourists has made separate spheres attractive, and resulted in the creation of cyberspaces in which different norms are presumed (black discussion groups, queer communities, women\'s listservs, etc.).  However, lack of physical validation of identity leads to \"infiltrators\" and identity tourists who self-represent as members of nonwhite, queer or female groups, often disrupting conversation with inappropriate or simply confusing behavior.\r\n\r\nAre there strategies that we can employ to reduce the amount of \"identity tourism\" (Nakamura), and increase the amount of serious reflection and consideration of the importance of race and gender in the lives of those who inhabit \"marked bodies\" in the \"real world\"?

As far as anyone knows, he never went back to clean up or re-forest any of his abandoned homesteads. \r\n\r\nIn the U.S.,  technology and media pioneers seem to follow the same recipe.  \r\n\r\nEvery 20 the 30 years, a new communications technology is rolled out, frequently marketed as the solution to the problems created or left unsolved by the previous communications technologies.  In the 1950s FM radio was supposed to offer better reception and more diversified content than AM radio.  In the 1970s, cable TV was supposed to offer a wider range of choices than the bland offerings of the three broadcast TV networks.  In the 1990\'s, the Internet and the World Wide Web was supposed to offer individual choice, low-cost publishing, and a broader range of diversified, noncommercial content than any other conventional media. \r\n\r\nAlways, the principle seem to be try something new, never mind going back to fix what might be wrong with the old. \r\n\r\nNow an unusual convergence of economic and technology trends is creating a rare opportunity to re-visit an old media homestead and make some dramatic changes. \r\n\r\n\"Spectrum,\" the right to send information through the airwaves, is becoming the key resource for the future of the entire communications industry. \r\n\r\nTelevision stations, radio stations, cell phone companies, ambulance and police dispatchers, even satellite signals being uploaded from giant TV network vans or downloaded to rooftop receivers, all depend on the technical ability and the legal right to send or receive electronic signals at varying frequencies and strengths. \r\n\r\nHeavily regulated by national governments and international agencies, spectrum is some of the most valuable property in the world.  But the rules for creating and regulating this unique form of property have been changing.  Since the mid-1980\'s, spectrum has been auctioned off to the cell-phone industry, usually for billions of dollars. This was a radical change from 50 years earlier, when spectrum was called \"the people\'s airwaves\" and the rights to use it were routinely given away -- free -- to radio and television broadcasters. \r\n\r\nNow a shortage of spectrum, of frequencies that can be effectively used to communicate, is causing significant conflict among groups that want to use it. \r\n\r\nThe deployment of wireless broadband is crucial to the development of so-called third-generation Internet services.  Technology pioneers like Bill Gates and Craig McCaw are requesting new allocations of spectrum, in order to offer innovative, Internet-based services for wireless devices.  These potential new products and services create the possibility of expanded growth and new jobs in a sector of the economy that was already battered by the collapse of the dot com stock boom. \r\n\r\nThe September 11 terrorist attacks highlighted this issue even further.  In the aftermath, emergency officials are pressing telecommunications companies and regulators for ways to give priority to emergency communications.  Most potential solutions require a significant increase in the spectrum devoted to emergency communications.  No one currently using that spectrum is willing to relinquish it, even for a cause this worthy.', 'Various reformers and critics have wrung their hands in the past about the impact of U.S. television and radio.  Newton Minow, the FCC commissioner who called U.S. television a \"vast wasteland\" in 1961, wrote in 1991 that the situation was so much worse 30 years later that he worried that TV was doing measurable harm to his grandchildren.  \r\n\r\nIt\'s easy to make the case that TV, with its emphasis on sex, violence, instant gratification, and relentless materialism, makes the job of every parent, teacher and religious leader in America more difficult.

Until recently, even the most passionate critics glumly acknowledged that U.S. broadcasters have one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington and that significant change was almost impossible to imagine. \r\n\r\nHowever, for the first time in modern communications history, people and organizations with real clout face incentives to do something almost never been done before:  re-visit decisions made decades earlier about important communications resources. \r\n\r\nThe pleas of emergency officials for better cell-phone service ring much louder today.  The possibility of new jobs and new investment in promising technology looks far more compelling today. \r\n\r\nThere is a real chance that a coalition of educators, technology companies and Internet activists could at least start a national debate about our decades-old policies of spectrum allocation -- and the old pattern of relying solely on new technology to solve the problems created by earlier technologies.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-11-14 19:54:33', '2002-01-28 07:08:59', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 48, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

More than ever, global competitiveness today is shaped by the effective engagement in the rapid creation and diffusion of knowledge and information, changing how investments are made and the way goods and services are produced, marketed, and traded.\r\n\r\nA knowledge economy involves the development, exploration, storage, interpretation and application of knowledge in the computer, telecommunications and multimedia industries (collectively known as Information and Communications Technology - ICT), as well as their application to more traditional sectors of economy such as agriculture and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nComing out with new ICT-based products and processes depends on knowledge-based approaches and management. Hence, the need to develop a knowledge society: Malaysians who have the ability, capacity and skills to generate and capture new knowledge, and access, absorb and use effectively, information, data and knowledge, with the support of ICT.\r\n\r\nIn short, the development of a knowledge economy is dependent on the development of a knowledge society. Here, the key factor of production is people, rather than land, labour or capital. \r\n\r\nSo it is that people development sits at the heart of the National IT Agenda (NITA), identified by the government as the key development thrust for Malaysia for the next millennium. Launched in 1996, the NITA\'s final goal is the creation of a Values-based Knowledge Society.\r\n\r\nThis task to develop and oversee the NITA falls upon the National IT Council (NITC), chaired by the Prime Minister and comprising of Cabinet ministers, senior government officials, private sector leaders, academicians and community sector representatives. \r\n\r\nIn building a k-society with Malaysian values, the solution lies beyond merely laying cables to wire up the whole nation and placing computers in every home. The overarching need is, in fact, to ensure that a digital divide does not widen the economic divide between those who have access to ICT and knowledge, and those who do not. Three issues, in particular, need to be addressed: access and equity, creating value and qualitative transformation. \r\n\r\nThese issues can only be addressed through comprehensive people development within the tripartite relationship of infostructure and ICT content and application development. \r\n\r\nHowever, to inspire citizens to get on board the ICT bandwagon, the NITC would have to demonstrate the real benefits that can be reaped by various communities and individuals by migrating to the information age via use of ICT. \r\n\r\nA solution would be the use of demonstrator application (DA) or pilot projects. DA\'s are small projects that span a short time frame, with clearly defined objectives. To be accredited DAs, nominated projects must feature the following characteristics:\r\n	\r\n·	Small, focused and short-term projects\r\n	Ideally, the projects should be small and focused on solving a particular problem within a target community. The implementation of the project should not exceed a period of more than 12 months. \r\n	\r\n·	Smart-partnership driven\r\n	The roles and responsibilities of each partner in a project should be clearly defined with each contributing a specific value towards the set objectives.\r\n	\r\n·	Emphasis on community inclusion, community building and local content creation\r\n	Each project should actively involve the community members at large and contribute towards the knowledge acquisition process by the community. The community, for its own consumption, should also create local content, ideally. \r\n	\r\n·	Model of sustainable development\r\n	The project should be able to sustain the continued development of knowledge for the benefit of', 'Proposed by the NITC in early 1998, DA is a key initiative for the realisation of objectives set out in NITA (National IT Agenda).

The majority of these projects focused on e-community development. This indicates that these projects have a wide and common appeal, and are not esoteric in nature. \r\n	\r\n	From these 45 DA\'s projects, an estimated 1.24 million people from 15 different target communities will potentially benefit from ICT exposure in various ways. \r\n	\r\n	The 15 target communities include:\r\n·	Small and medium sized enterprises.\r\n·	Educators.\r\n·	Orphanage and Home administrators.\r\n·	Patients and their family members.\r\n·	Army veterans.\r\n·	Researchers.\r\n·	People with disabilities (hearing impaired).\r\n·	Farmers.\r\n·	Mixed community in locality.\r\n·	Students.\r\n·	Urban and sub-urban family members \r\n·	Members of women\'s organisations.\r\n·	General Practitioners and doctors.\r\n·	Government servants.\r\n·	Publishers.\r\n	\r\n	In terms of technology development, most of the projects are focused on leveraging the power of the Internet to serve targeted communities, that is, via  the development of a vertical portal. This portal is  supplemented by database development.\r\n	\r\n	In certain instances, specific applications were developed for target communities. They include multimedia information kiosks, e-commerce tools, e-mentoring systems, multimedia courseware, an IT system for the hearing impaired community, and e-book technology. The development of these applications is encouraging  and indicative of the availability of local talent and resources to create applications that suit specific needs.', 'The Demonstrator Application (DA) a unique formula established in 1998 to give all Malaysians an opportunity to be acculturated and be involved in ICT-based and related activities. \r\nLessons learned\r\nThe introduction of the DAGS to citizens was one of the first efforts by the NITC to practise what it preaches by providing the financial impetus to e-projects. The Demonstrator Application Grant Scheme (DAGS) has experienced rapid growth since its launching in April 1998.  Along the way, DAGS has come to be recognised as a dynamic program that supports innovative projects relating to information communication technology (ICT), as well as being a model of a smart partnership project between the public, private and community interest sectors. Looking back, we acknowledge that the NITC Secretariat was not completely prepared for what took place since the announcement of the DAGS. But it resulted in valuable lessons learned, which has helped make the DAGS projects an even more effective and worthwhile endeavour. Some of the crucial lessons that the DAGS Secretariat members learned are:\r\n\r\n·	The need for a strong Promoter and Knowledge Broker\r\nFrom the onset, it was evident to the DAGS team that the identification and participation of a project promoter is critical to the success of the DA project. The promoter generally plays the role of knowledge broker, who takes ownership of all development pertaining to the DA project. The promoter is instrumental in encouraging, inspiring and pushing the limits of human ability in completing the task ahead. Without the promoters, the DA project will be as good as failure from the start.\r\n\r\n·	A willing and available pilot community\r\nA willing and available pilot community as a target is the flip side of a strong promoter. Having a good promoter alone will not suffice. The community, who are the direct beneficiaries, needs to have a right mental attitude and correct mindset in order to succeed. With the involvement of the target community, the promoter need not swim against the current. Rather, they flourish as a team, heading toward a common objective.\r\n\r\n·	An experimental attitude\r\nBoth the promoter and the community need to have an innovative experimental attitude in order to test the limits of human creativity. Without creativity and an experimental attitude, there will be little improvements and innovation to the way things normally progress in the course of time. Smart partnerships with private sector technology providers will further require a risk-taking attitude. As this is purely a project to demonstrate the viability of a DA project, a certain amount of risk-taking spirit needs to be considered by the technology providers, which goes beyond the secular reasoning of profit-oriented approach.\r\n \r\n\r\n·	Sustainability plan is important to ensure for project continuation\r\nAs the DA program only funds a project for a period of twelve months, the project needs to develop a clear sustainability and commercialisation plan into their business model right from day one. Without sustainability and self sufficiency plans, the project risks collapsing after the twelve-month period of financial support from the DA program. The whole effort then would turn into a wasteful endeavour and a costly lesson learned.

Unfortunately there is a scarcity of what Ray Oldenburg calls \"great good places\" that are convenient and welcoming. In many regions of the world people have forgotten how to \"hang out\" with friends, a lost art that refreshes the spirit and &mdash; sometimes &mdash; leads to social action as well.', 'This pattern is applicable to any place where people live.

Unfortunately these locations are threatened in many places. Many factors can contribute to the decline in great good places. Some neighborhoods may be dangerour or have a mistrusting atmosphere. Some may be too economically disadvantaged to be able to afford a safe place with a roof overhead. Moreover in the era of television and the car, the art of spending time around people that might be strangers may be dying. Other locations may have such high rents that it becomes necessary to cycle customers quickly to increase the \"efficiency\" of the cafe.\r\n\r\nOldenburg discusses many instances of the role of the \"great good place\" in history. These include German beer gardens in the US in the early 1990s, Viennese coffee shopts, French cafe society and the like.  It also discusses the fascinating role of taverns etc. in the development of the journalism, the media, business practices, and social change &mdash; including the American revolution against the British. Oldenburg quotes Sam Warner (1968) who states that the informal tavern groups \"provided the underlying fabric of the town, and when the Revolution began made it possible to gather militia companies quickly, to form effective committees of correspondence and of inspection, and to organize and to manage mass town meetings.\"  \r\n\r\nBradie Derrenger makes the important point that the \"great good place\" might not always be a traditional coffee or donut shop.

Many such arguments are based primarily on the faute de mieux rationale of the prohibitive cost for many of owning technology tools. Yet individual ownership, and individual -or even private- use is not only the dominant (imposed) economic model but also a preferred behavior. It has been observed that intensity of use and satisfaction with ICT augmented when switching from collective to individual access (1). However, the preference for individual ownership and use coexists with the recognition that not only may technology be financially out of reach, but also that under certain circumstances (e.g., when learning how to use the facility or when encountering particularly stimulating resources), one wishes to share with others the experience of learning and using ICT. Moreover, the positive aspects of the collective mode may be further reinforced by additional experiences found in different milieux, such as those outside the classroom, family home or work place, participating in related useful activities (e.g., training or social work).\r\n\r\nWe are therefore confronted with a dialectic that is not straightforward in Hegelian terms. The\r\nthesis and the antithesis are both ambivalent, borrowing pros and cons from each other, though marginally, and incorporating additional factors which are themselves bringing a mix of pros and cons. The synthesis is consequently far more subtle, balanced and progressive. It is also likely to result in a new confrontation between no less ambivalent poles. Miller and Slater(2) have highlighted this phenomenon of dialectical evolution, which they called \"dynamics\". However, in their interpretation, these \"dynamics\" are described as a tension between homogeneous drives, for instance, to be more oneself (Trinidadian par excellence) while also becoming more another self, creator of a new (cyber) universe. In the system we describe, these two forces can be seen as part of a single pole which is itself working with/against another one both with an ambivalent combination of visibility and privacy drives.  One pole is constituted by the private self who is necessarily also socially situated, while the other is constituted by the collective self who also needs to focus privately on his or her own learning processes. \r\n\r\nAn additional layer of complexity resides in the fact that this dialectical process among ambivalent forces is played out in each of the domains where real people live and communicate: personal, family, social, professional. In each of them, communications may take place in both analog (i.e., non-electronic exchanges with others) and digital form. In most instances, the effect of digital communication cannot be explained without taking into account those of analog communication. Furthermore, there is no strict boundary, at least in terms of knowledge base, among these different domains, and they all interact, as Menou contended in an earlier paper, constituting among them a complex \"composite space\" (3).\r\n\r\nIn such a situation, most established tools and procedures for assessing an initial situation,\r\ndesigning ICT applications that can serve community goals, monitoring their effects, and assessing their outcomes or impact, are grossly inadequate. For instance, asking people if the intensity of their face-to-face social relationships is reduced by their use of the Internet is nonsensical within this framework, as the communication is obviously taking place amidst a set of dialectical ambivalences that seek both more and less interaction in both modes, with both more and less openness or exposure.', 'Use methods of data collection, analysis and discussion of findings that combine the opposite values of each factor. An example is the Yin-Yang scale Menou has proposed (3). Avoid unidirectional scales.\r\n\r\nThe \"Sense-Making\" theory and methodology developed by Brenda Dervin is another example of an enquiry process which maintains a strong association between opposite factors.\r\nThe project cycle should be accompanied by a open, collective and continuous process of learning. The command and control activities in design, managing and evaluating should be left aside of the above learning process\r\nNested micro-projects based upon people\'s real need should be preferred to large catch all projects where people\'s conscientization is very difficult, if at all attempted.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-11-19 13:26:58', '2006-08-05 19:33:54', NULL, NULL, 'City University', NULL, 80, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Should large corporations like Microsoft attempt to address this issue, and if so, how?', NULL, 'Human intuition, common sense, and research (Lewis, Amini, and Lannon, 2000) all support the simple notion that people need each other.  However, over the past several decades, our country has taken several steps to decimate the social fabric that helps us to help each other.\r\n<P>\r\nPutnam (2000) writes about the dramatic decline in civic participation since the 1960s in everything from the PTA to voting in elections to league bowling.  Putnam argues that increased television watching is the most likely reason people stopped participating in their communities.  On average, Americans spend three to four hours every day watching TV; in 1995, the average American spent 40% of their free time watching TV; and between 1965 and 1995, the average American gained six hours a week of added leisure time, and spent just about all of it watching TV (Putnam, p. 222  223).\r\n<P>\r\nDuany, Plater-Zyberk, and Speck (2000) would argue that people watch so much TV because their communities are designed such that people have little reason to walk outside of their homes.  Suburban planning necessitates driving to get anywhere, and the result is communities that are designed to be car-friendly instead of person-friendly.  As a result, people seldom walk around their neighborhoods, bump into each other, and strike up the kinds of informal conversations that form the basis of strong neighborhoods.  When people leave their homes, its almost always in their car (and while people are driving, the last thing they want to do is bump into each other to chat).\r\n<P>\r\nThe effects of declining involvement in community are frightening.  Putnam argues that the decline in community participation creates neighborhoods that arent as safe, economies that arent as prosperous, and people that arent as healthy or happy.  In fact, if you smoke and dont belong to any groups, joining just one group can have the same effect on your long-term health as quitting smoking (p. 331).  Putnam also argues that the decline in community creates less effective schools, a view thats supported by Wagner (2002).  Wagner notes that spending time with adults is critical for developing adolescents, yet adolescents only spend about 5% of their time with their parents, and only 1.6% of their time with other adults.  On average, adolescents spend 27% of their time by themselves.\r\n<P>\r\nUnfortunately, teens in our nation arent the only ones spending so much time by themselves.  We have become a nation that spends incredible amounts of time behind the wheel and in front of the television instead of with each other.  The result is dramatically weakened communities.\r\n<P>\r\nCan technology help to strengthen community at the street-level?  Countless research and development dollars have been spent on technologies that allow us to connect with people on the other side of the planet.  However, perhaps the most helpful technologies are ones that help us connect with people on the other side of the street.\r\n<P>\r\nWhat would such technology look like?  The Internet already serves as a communications infrastructure that links homes, schools, and government offices, but the barriers to communication with our communities still seems to be too high.  Despite research showing that communities can be strengthened with technology as simple as a neighborhood e-mail distribution list (Hampton, 2001), reports of widespread use of e-mail among neighbors seems to be rare.  Getting my neighbors e-mail addresses requires that I knock on their doors.  The barriers to communication are still too high.', 'Large software corporations like Microsoft could lower the barriers to neighborhood communication by:\r\n<P>\r\n1) Automatically generating shared virtual spaces for every neighborhood; every elementary, middle, and high school; and every local, state, and federal government representative district in the United States.\r\n<P>\r\n2) Building software that verifies that people live where they say they do and giving them the ability to join the appropriate shared virtual spaces.\r\n<P>\r\n3) Designing the software such that being a part of these communities is as simple as turning on your computer and connecting to the Internet.\r\n<P>\r\n3) Making the software ubiquitous (for example, by including it in the next release of Windows).\r\n<P>\r\nThis conference asks Tomorrows information and communication infrastructure is being shaped todaybut by whom and to what ends?  Should Microsoft attempt to build this type of software?

Families may become geographically dispersed over time, contact may be lost with former work associates, and/or diminishing physical capacity may limit the aged person\'s ability to be socially engaged in the community in which they live.  Such social isolation and reduced mental stimulation can contribute to clinical depression and retard new neuron growth, thus in itself accelerating the aging process (Fox, 2001).', 'Any situations in which aged persons are living in a socially impoverished environment are suitable for this pattern.  Some environments, however, may be easier to target initially for study because, for other contributing reasons (e.g. inability to physically care for oneself) they have become centres of social isolation for those living within them (ironically, in a \'community\' setting).  Another context to be initially targetted is that of aged persons living alone who actively seek, but may not find, satisfying social engagement in, for example, club environments.', 'Much has been written of the power of new information and communication technologies to bring people together, to allow people to access vast amounts of information from almost anywhere, to engage everyone in a brave new world of digital community.  Yet we are not so naive to assume that the mere existence of these technologies will produce such outcomes.  Also, much has been written of the dangers of the \'digital divide\': the growing accessibility gap to those technologies between, for example, the rich and poor, urban and rural, male and female.  Another sector of society, cutting across all other demographic indicators, who are at risk of falling prey to the digital divide are the elderly.  \r\n\r\nThe tragedy is that, at a time in the lives of the aged when physical and social factors may unavoidably result in their increasing social isolation, the possibility of employing technology to alleviate their isolation has been vastly under-explored.  Perhaps it is too easily assumed that \'old people\' and technology don\'t mix, or that somehow they do not have the mental capacity to cope with new technologies, or maybe through ignorance of what the technologies can offer them, the elderly have not created sufficient pressure in a business sense to attract the attention of developers.  Yet, in an aging Western population, this is a matter of social and economic responsibility that cannot be ignored. In Australia, it is the elderly \'baby-boomers\' who are expected to have a disproportionate share of wealth in the near future. Information and communication technologies exist that can alleviate social isolation and provide mental stimulation. It is proposed that a pattern be developed to address this issue, bringing the technology and the elderly together in productive and sustainable physical and digital environments.\r\n\r\nThe pattern to be developed, therefore, is twofold: promote social settings in which the elderly have constant and convenient access to information and communication technologies; and develop software interfaces which are sensitive to the specific needs of the elderly.  This recognizes that there is more to engaging an aged person in a virtual community than giving them access to a computer (although this is part of it). We must investigate what features of that virtual community and its interface will ensure a socially satisfying experience for this specific sector of our society.  Elements of existing patterns for inclusive interface design are informative (e.g. Bowe, 2000) and may provide the basis for the development of a specific interface design pattern for the aged. We also need to choose or re-design the contexts in which elderly people can access the virtual community in the most satisfying way.', 'By establishing a collaborative consortium of hardware company, telecommunication company, internet service provider, and training/support provider (accessing available government funding), it is possible to provide convenient, staffed internet/email access centres for the aged.  These must be located in sites physically accessible to the aged persons (in the first instance, nursing homes and clubs) to open the door to a vast virtual community.  In conjunction with providing physical access to necessary technologies, a pattern of interface design and meaningful activities for the aged (engaging the elderly in the process) must be developed to ensure that their specific needs are met.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-11-24 15:47:11', '2002-01-28 07:00:03', NULL, NULL, 'Australian Catholic University', NULL, 88, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Other adults are not currently in the workforce, and thus face the heightened challenge of attaining the skills that would allow them to enter the workforce (for example, homemakers, disabled persons, the elderly, and members of minority groups).\r\n\r\nIn the US, and other \"advanced\" nations, many education initiatives are underway to address the challenge of developing an information technology workforce. Most approaches involve formal education, for example, expanding and better utilizing university programs in computer science, or providing university extension or community college programs. It is clearly important to increase the capacity and accessibility of such programs. However, formal education is frequently inaccessible to adult learners in a sense more profound than the mere availability of classroom seats. Adult learners are not engaged effectively by the \"learning for learning\'s sake\" orientation of formal education. For adults it is critically important to learn new skills in a meaningful context in which real goals are pursued and achieved in the course of the learning (Knowles, 1973; Carroll, 1990). \r\n\r\nThe training challenge of an information technology workforce in advanced nations is a special case of what is now widely called the \"digital divide\": The global chasm between those who have access to technology and the skills to use it, and those who do not.', 'Informal, community-based activities can complement formal approaches to the training challenge of an information technology workforce.  Persons not in workforce may still be active and engaged members of their community. Indeed, homemakers and retired people are typically more engaged in community development activities than the fully employed, who often work outside the community.

Based on our (the authors\') experiences in the I.T. field, and an analysis of selected cases, we have developed a typology of victims to be used, we believe, as a very necessary first step in setting a future research agenda. In our typology, we have defined four categories of victims according to characteristics of behaviour that place them at risk of victimization. These are: the naive user, the frugal user, the invulnerable user, and the desiring user.  We have also attempted to define the relationship between user-victim type and risk of victimization for different types of online offences. For example, we suggest that the naive user is an individual who sees the Internet largely as a benevolent place, and therefore he or she is more likely to provide personal information online to strangers. \r\n\r\nWe also discuss the nature of trust and distrust online, and map out two particular types of trust that we see as playing a role in facilitating risk-taking behaviour by individuals online. These are: personal and probabilistic trust. Probabilistic trust is defined as trust that arises from a favourable risk assessment. We see this form of trust as dependant on actuarial calculations (i.e. considering all relevant factors, what is my risk of victimization if I engage in this particular activity?) Probabilistic trust is based on the individuals perceptions of their own ability to discern risk and to take appropriate actions to avoid victimization. This form is contrasted with personal trust, which is defined as trust arising from an users perception of others as trustworthy. In essence, the former user relies on his or her own abilities, whereas the latter relies on the trustworthiness of others. We see both types of trust as existing on a continuum, rather than as absolute values. Thus, a user can exhibit both probabilistic and personal trust, although we do suggest that some users are more likely to act based on one form, rather than on another.\r\n\r\nAuthors: Laura Huey and Richard S.

He has visions of a successful career as a software developer, but either lacks the information that he needs to achieve his goals in this area or has not yet taken advantage of what limited useful information may exist within his social network of family, friends and teachers.  David has access to computers at his home, the local public library and through his high school.  He knows there are classes available at the public library and has taken some classes in his junior high school.  Though David has not recently taken any classes to increase his computer skills and mentioned in an interview that he does not know how to make web pages needs to work on his typing, he is convinced of his future success in the computer realm.\r\n\r\nHis mother believes computers will be important to David\'s future success and encourages him to look into computer classes, but does not offer David specific information about the location or availability of these opportunities.  She encourages David to succeed, but there are clear limits in her understanding of the skills needed to succeed today in the network society.\r\n\r\nDavid lacks not only the specific computer skills (what Bourdieu has labeled cultural capital) but more importantly, we believe, he lacks social capital--networks of people who could help David to understand what either a computer job or a successful career in the IT world would entail.\r\n\r\nWe would suggest that while David may not be \"typical,\" based on continued research in schools and community centers, we have reasons to believe his experiences, and his beliefs about those experiences, are not unusual or idiosyncratic either.  Case studies and ethnographically gathered data can provide a level of evidence and understanding that would be more difficult to obtain through other research methods.  Not only can we see the things that David, essentially, does not know about his future prospects (information that would be difficult to gather through a survey, for example), but we have not seen in our interviews that he even knows what he doesn\'t know--and that is the tragic part about the disconnect for teens like David and where the lack of social capital most affects David and others like him so adversely.  \r\n\r\nThrough open-ended, though focused, ethnographic interviews with David and his mother, we can begin to understand, for example, the ways in which it is clear that there exists a great disconnect between, for many today, dreams and aspirations regarding future participation in the network society and a lack of means by which these dreams can be reached.

The development of such a system presents unusual technical and social challenges: the technical challenge of developing a complex, multipurpose database and World Wide Web interface and the social challenge of building a community united by the shared purpose of serving our areas young people. This pattern explains how participatory-design (PD) processes grounded in activity theory are helping us to conceive and build this complex technical/social system.', 'These challenges will present themselves in any local community but will be particularly daunting in a community characterized by a digital divide, and the wider the divide, the greater the challenges will be. Our own community of Troy, New York, is a typical decaying Northeastern city, with a substantial minority population, low income levels, low levels of educational achievement, all clustered in an aging urban central city. Home to two major colleges, the city nonetheless has a population of only 18.4% with bachelor\'s degrees, according to the 1990 census. It is a mirror image of the digital divide.', 'Our project, tentatively called Connected Kids (http://troynet.net/connectedkids/, March 12, 2002), embraces a diversity of participants within a complex \"activity system\" representing city, county, public and private schools, and youth-services organizations (see Figure 1). We brought these participants together in a series of focus groups in October 2000, to develop specifications for the youth-services information system, and in a series of PD sessions in November 2001, to confirm our understanding of these specifications and to invite participants to review mockups and get some hands-on experience with a prototype of one of the system components. The PD sessions renewed and revised our understanding of our shared purpose, expanded our understanding of our audiences and users, and identified system enhancements through hands-on activity and collaborative discussion. The sessions also revealed contradictions or tensions within the activity system and thus invited changes in the prototype and in the activity system itself.\r\n\r\nBuilding a Shared Purpose. At the beginning of each PD session, we explained that we understood from the focus groups that the information system would have to provide a central location for Web-based information for youth-services organizations, parents, and kids, Web-site service for some (usually smaller) organizations, and general information, with links to existing Web sites, for other (usually larger) organizations. For the most part, participants simply confirmed these understandings, often without further comment, but they also revealed tensions within the activity system, such as doubts about the need for fiber-optic cable linking organizations within the city and about the reliability of our undergraduate students, given their relatively short-term (usually one-semester) commitments to our project. We realized that we needed to address these tensions, for example, by enlisting students to provide technical support for participating organizations over the longer term.    \r\n\r\nDefining Audiences and Users. Participants also expanded our understanding of our audiences and users by pointing out the needs of young people for legal services, such as alternative-sentencing opportunities, the needs of our areas growing Hispanic population and the needs of neighborhood organizations, and the concerns of school administrators about the security of the system. We acknowledged these needs but noted the challenge of attracting graduate students or staff bilingual in English and Spanish or conversant with the special needs of students with disabilities or otherwise able to help us to meet the many and diverse needs of young people in our community. We have not yet been able to resolve all of these tensions in our activity system.   \r\n\r\nIdentifying System Enhancements.

Although we had anticipated the need for a copy-and-paste function to permit easy transfer of electronic data, we had not anticipated the need to duplicate whole pages of input, a concern of organizations with numerous programs and services to enter into the system. In addition, we had not imagined the need for different key words to describe the same activity for different audiences, such as \"recreation\" for young people and \"gang prevention\" for parents.\r\n\r\nEncouraging Hands-on Activity and Collaborative Discussion. We invited participants to engage in hands-on data input and share their experience with the system in collaborative group discussion. We suspected that a hands-on activity followed by group discussion might be productive of new possibilities that might not emerge in one-on-one discussions between participants and designers. For example, we had not anticipated the need to permit users to duplicate and revise whole pages of data. This possibility, though obvious enough in retrospect, emerged only when one participant from a large organization noted the difficulty of retyping the same data on numerous pages, and another participant with a technical background reminded us of the relative ease of duplicating pages of data already stored in the database.', 'We are aware that our complex \"activity system\" is replete with contradictions and tensions, and we do not yet have sufficient evidence to demonstrate that PD processes alone can resolve all of these difficulties. Nonetheless, we believe that bringing together a diversity of participants in hands-on activity and collaborative group discussion directed toward a shared purpose can help us to build both a better technical system and a stronger social community over the longer term.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-11-28 23:13:29', '2002-04-07 14:57:21', NULL, NULL, 'Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute', NULL, 87, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

While this may seem expedient in the short term, it often leads to serious problems and distortions, particularly in times of crisis or transition when the correlation between ersatz measures and actuality substantially drifts or even suddenly disconnects.  Actions can be based on these measures or models of reality rather than on reality.', 'Many problems were partly responsible for the disaster at the Three Mile Island.  One crucial problem in particular arose from the design of a feedback loop.  A switch was supposed to close a valve.  Beside the switch was a light that was supposed to show that the valve was closed.  In fact, rather than having the light actually go on as the result of feedback from the valve closure itself, the signal light was merely a collateral circuit to the switch.  All it actually showed was that the switch had moved position (Wickens, 1984).  Under normal operation; that is, when the valve was operating normally, these two events were perfectly correlated.  At a critical point in the meltdown, however, the valve was not operating properly and an operator believed that the valve was closed even though it failed to close.  The resulting actions, taken on the basis of the assumption that the valve was closed, exacerbated the problems.\r\n\r\nIn running an application program recently, I was given a feedback message that a file was posted.  In fact, it wasn\'t.  The programmer, rather than checking to see whether the file was actually posted, merely relied on the completion of a loop. \r\n\r\nIn advertising campaigns, it is difficult to measure the impact on sales.  Instead, companies typically measure the \"recall\" and \"recognition\" rates of ads.  This may often be correlated with sales changes, but in some cases, the ad may be very memorable but give the customer a very negative impression of the company and decrease the chances of actually selling a product. \r\n\r\nHistorically, monarchs and dictators often surrounded themselves only with people who gave them good reports and support no matter how their decisions impacted the reality of their realm.  Eventually, the performance of such people tended to deteriorate over time because their behavior was shaped by this ersatz feedback rather than reality.\r\n\r\nDuring the \"oil crisis\" in the seventies, oil companies relied on mathematical models of continually increasing demand.  Year after year, for seven years, they relied on these models to predict demand despite the fact that, for seven years, demand actually went down.  The results are purported to have cost them tens of billions of dollars (Van der Heijden, 1996).', 'Forces \r\n\r\nOrganizations are often hierarchically decomposed and  bureaucratic.  Therefore, it is often simplest to communicate with those close to us in the hierarchy and to build systems that rely for their model of reality only on things within the immediate control span of our small part of the organization. \r\n\r\nWhile more comfortable to limit system design and development to those things within one\'s own team or department, it is often precisely the work necessary to capture more reality based measures that will reveal additional challenges and opportunities in business process coherence.  \r\n\r\nThe measure of reality is often more time-consuming, more costly, or more difficult than the measure of something more proximal that is often correlated with reality.\r\n\r\nIt is likely to be exactly at times of crisis and transition that the correlation between proximal ersatz measures and their referent in reality will be destroyed.  \r\n\r\nIt is likely to be exactly under times of crisis and transition that people will tend to simplify their cognitive models of the world and, among other things, forget that the proximal measure is only ersatz.\r\n\r\nKnown Uses \r\n\r\nRichard Feynman, during the Manhattan project, noticed that the bureaucracy was worried about the possibility of accidentally stockpiling a critical mass of uranium.  To prevent this, each section chief was required to insure that their section did not have a critical mass.  To insure this, each section chief instructed each sub-section chief to insure that their subsection didn\'t have a critical mass and so on, down to the smallest level of the bureaucracy.  Upon hearing this plan, Feynman observed that neutrons probably didn\'t much care whose subsection they reported to! (Hutchins, et. als., \r\n\r\nIn another incident, various bureaucrats were each trying to prove that they had better security than their peers.  In order to prove this, they escalated the buying of bigger and thicker safes.  The bigger and thicker the safe, the more they felt that they had made their secrets secure.  Feynman discovered that more than half of the super-safe safes had been left with the factory installed combinations of 50-50-50 and were trivially easy to break into.   \r\n\r\nPaula Underwood, in The Walking People, describes many mechanisms that the Iroquois used to keep their oral history accurate.

', 'Two forces have been thwarting the success of community networking on the Internet: the move from a text-based medium to a multi-media platform; and the increasing commercialization and conglomeration of the Internet providers.  Although the technological changes brought about with digital processing allow for a many-to-many model of communication through the Internet, advances in digital processing have also meant that designing a multimedia message requires a complex set of skills including traditional literacy, visual literacy and HTML or Java programming and digital literacy.  Barnes, 1996, 1999).  And with the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 creating a competitive commercial telecommunication environment through deregulation, consolidation has occurred in the communication industry and most broadband Internet providers are designing their systems as walled gardens, keeping their customers within the confines of the service (Aufderheide, 2000) limiting the Internet from its potential as a fully many-to-many communication medium for all.  Although the E-Rate provision of the 1996 Telecommunications Act offers an antidote, it only provides support for K-12 schools and libraries, not community organizations, urban health care providers, church groups, and other not-for-profit organizations.  Community networks are gradually being taken over by commercial interests, which are not interested in public access networking.  In contrast to the United States, Canadas community networking systems are highly successful because Canada has established government support and public policies to help community networks (Travers, 2000).\r\nLack of digital literacy skills combined with no provisions for public networking by Internet providers are keeping many individuals and grassroots community groups from being able to utilize the medium effectively or at all.

Others suggest that these skills will be essential to future success, regardless of where students acquire them (Stjern, 2001).  Beyond curriculum changes and purchasing decisions, many schools are offering after-school sessions where students are encouraged to spend time in a computer lab, taking advantage of relatively unstructured access to either the Internet or educational software.  Is this an effective use of time for these schools (and students) and what can we learn from examining computer and Internet use at these sites?', 'Schools are important sites where it is suggested that the negative attributes of finding oneself on the \"wrong\" side of the digital divide, meaning not only access to computer and Internet technology, but also access to skill training related to this technology, can be lessened.  Access to computers and the Internet is increasing at these locations (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2001), but beyond purchasing more computer hardware of software as a presumptive necessity to close this divide, my work focuses on what happens in schools when this technology is made available.  The question is, therefore, not what is available to elementary students, but equally importantly, how do they use this technology once it is made available?', 'I spent 120 contact hours at Lincoln Elementary School, a 450 student K-5 school within the Mountain School District, 30 miles outside of Denver, Colorado.  According to the Colorado Department of Education, a little over 50% of the students at Lincoln Elementary were eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch in 1999 as compared to 27% of students both statewide and within the entire Mountain School District.  I additionally volunteered at Lincoln\'s Family Library and Computer Night (\"Family Night\") from February through June, 2001, where I worked with other teachers and the director of Lincolns Federal Title 7 grant to make sure the students who arrived each Tuesday were able to use the computers and access the Internet without incident.  The goal of the Family Night was to offer students and families another point of contact to Lincoln Elementary and Eve Simpson, the teacher in charge of the family night, had a specific vision for the students\' time: They were free to access on the Internet any site that passed through the firewall set up by the district after working on an educational site for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nImportantly, this time on Tuesday nights was seen as an opportunity to bring students and parents into the school--giving them another opportunity to connect.  This is not to say that the computer training was unimportant, but there were no structured classes or lessons offered.  I would typically arrive before family night began at 7pm and search the Internet for an interesting educational site the students could access.  Most nights, students worked on the educational site only until they were released and given permission to scour the web for their favorite games on foxkids.com or print out the latest pictures from the site of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).  In a future paper my discussion will focus not on question of educational content, but on the ways in which this family night brought students into the network society--of game playing and entertainment sites.  This suggestion--that today the Internet exists for entertainment and game playing--will be considered using stories from families I have interviewed as part of a research team at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  Where once the Internet was touted as a place for democracy and education (it still is, to some extent), today it is increasingly seen by many using it as a place for entertainment and shopping.\r\n\r\nFor many students, family night was their once-weekly shot to surf the web and Eve and others recognized, correctly I would argue, that a connection to their school, even through the auspices of the WWF website, was a benefit for the students.  When I pointed out that one regularly attending bilingual was telling his friends about the WWF site she said to me, \"well, at least he\'s reading.\"  Not all the teachers agreed with Eve, however, and I will relay these stories also in my discussion.', 'The solution rests in recognizing that today many in schools, especially those schools serving children from underprivileged communities, believe that computer and Internet skillsone necessary element to participation in the network society--offer a way \"out\" and the opportunity for a better life.  While this may or may not be the case (and evidence exists on both sides of that discussion) I would like to suggest that there is nothing wrong with offering relatively open Internet access to children who may spend an hour each week at an after-school program playing games on commercial Internet sites.  These students need not interact with educational software and specifically designed games every time they log in to a computer.  Instead, they must be allowed to develop their own interests related to computers and the Internet.  Many of those working with IT today came to their love of computers through tinkering and experimentation with computers when younger.  Educational software may be useful in certain situations, but certainly not in all.  After-school programs can provide a useful opportunity for students to connect with their school and teachers (Walter, Caplan, & McElvain, 2000) and if the Internet is the carrot offered, students benefit from playing the games and surfing the web at these locations.

Depending on online behaviours and the contexts in which e-mail lists are used subscribers might be prompted to become (more) involved with activist groups or prevented from doing so.', 'While Internet technologies play a significant role in the current wave of globalisation-to facilitate the free movement of capital and corporations through the technological restructuring of financial transactions and working conditions-they are also increasingly used by anti-globalisation groups and other social activist groups. In 1999, for example, the Internet was used to organise protest activities surrounding the WTO (World Trade Organisation) summit in Seattle, USA. The success of these protests is often attributed to the use of the Internet and, in particular, electronic mailing lists. At the same time, turnouts to \'mass-protests\' in Europe continued to remain at relatively low levels, despite the increasing use of electronic mailing lists. It is therefore crucial to explore under what conditions the use of electronic mailing lists by social activist groups contribute to or hinder the mobilisation of list subscribers, and whether they are helpful in fostering people\'s short-term and long-term involvement with social activist groups.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Internet in 1999 to help organise activities against the WTO summit was certainly not the first time the Internet was used by social activist groups. In 1997, for example, a group set up an electronic mailing list and a website to facilitate organising against an APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit in Vancouver, Canada. This group\'s electronic mailing list had up to about 250 subscribers. Yet, up until the culminating events during the week of the APEC summit, the number of attendants at group actions only ranged from a handful to about 40. \r\n\r\nConsequently, I undertook research to develop recommendations for uses of e-mail lists. These recommendations should be useful for any activist groups and also other groups that use e-mails list and want list subscribers more actively involved in online and/or offline activities. While, at first glance, some of the recommendations may seem trivial, my research in particular, and observation of uses of electronic mailing lists in general, show that the concerns and problems behind these recommendations are either not taken into account for the use of e-mail lists or are not taken care of effectively.', 'I developed the recommendations below during my study on the uses of two e-mail lists, which, over the course of several months, were used to organise opposition and create alternatives to the globalisation agenda pursued and represented through an APEC summit in Canada and both a European Union and a G7/G8 summit in Germany. In both cases, local groups formed specifically to protest the respective meetings, expecting to exist only temporarily. The e-mail lists were, however, also used by other groups thereby allowing for long-term involvement.\r\n\r\nIn my study, I draw on a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses of the messages sent through both lists and questionnaires sent to and interviews conducted with group participants. Due to my intimate knowledge of the group in Canada--I worked with this group and also helped maintain their e-mail list before I decided to undertake this research --I was able to select interview participants from a wide range of social locations, such as extent of group involvement, age, ethnicity, gender, and class background. This allows me to examine in-depth the uses of the \'Canadian\' list by a cross-section of subscribers for their (non-)involvement in group activities. For the list set up in Germany, I interviewed everybody who volunteered to take part in the study. As a result of this self-selection, interview participants were mostly organisers or had previous experiences organising with groups. This allows me to examine organisers\' different uses of the \'German\' list and to compare these to the organisers\' uses of the \'Canadian\' list.\r\n\r\nThe interviews serve as a means to understand the experience of group participants with the Internet (in general and regarding mobilisation in particular) and the meaning they make of that experience. Subscribers were, for example, asked about their use of electronic mailing lists and the effects online messages had on their involvement with groups using these lists. To assess whether the usage of electronic mailing lists facilitates the mobilisation of their subscribers, a link between what happens online and offline needs to be made. While the interviews serve this end to some extent, I also analyse the messages posted to the e-mail lists. These messages are examined as to: how groups framed their goals and activities; how subscribers responded to these online framing efforts; differences in subscribers\' online behaviour and whether that reflected their social location; how structural features of e-mail lists shaped online messages; and how the contexts such lists were used in (such as group size or a group\'s objectives) affected online interactions. \r\n\r\nLacking any particular control groups (due to the limited time frame of my study), I did ask interview participants about their experiences with other e-mail lists and with other social activist groups (whether these groups use(d) e-mail lists and whether they were short- or long-lived). These comparisons allow me to develop tentative recommendations for how activist groups could use e-mail lists more fruitfully. Further studies on experiences of activists with electronic mailing lists and the employment of the recommendations could improve these recommendations.\r\n\r\nSometimes only some of these recommendations will be needed and sometimes activists might come up with additional ideas for how to make the use of their e-mail lists more fruitful. In some cases processes need to be formalized more than in others. Group participants need to talk about their own needs and set their lists up accordingly and make changes when necessary. The recommendations below are not meant to be a solution to end all problems, but rather to provide a good starting point to tackle common problems in the uses of electronic mailing lists.', 'the following steps might lead to a more fruitful use of electronic mailing lists: \r\n<UL>\r\n<LI> Make group participants aware of where they can get public access to computers and where they can learn how to use computers. (Consider providing these services, perhaps in collaboration with other groups.) \r\n<LI> Make information available to people without Internet access, e.g. through a blackboard with printouts or by passing out information during meetings. \r\n<LI> Remember: the Internet is only one way to get the word out about group actions, meetings, and goals. Posters, phone calls, etc. are a must. \r\n<LI> Write a statement of purpose for the use of the mailing list. Send this statement to every new subscriber. Send it out as a reminder on a regular basis or when needed. \r\n<LI> Consider having more than one list. Maybe one for announcements only, and one for discussions. Have all responses to announcements sent to the discussion list.  Consider setting up additional lists as needed or encourage subscribers to do so. \r\n  <UL>\r\n  <LI> Moderate the announcement-only list. \r\n  <LI> Have a process in place to moderate the discussion list when necessary. \r\n  </UL>\r\n<LI> Regularly send short summaries to the mailing lists about what is going on (online and offline) and what has been going on over time. Include links and contact addresses (electronic and otherwise) for where to obtain more information. Make these summaries available to people without Internet access. \r\n<LI> Make subscribers aware that the mailing list might be under surveillance and let them know how they can protect themselves (e.g. pass on info from http://security.tao.ca/). \r\n<LI> Think about if and when to use anonymous email or aliases (for example for accounts of illegal activities). Don\'t, however, make it a default. \r\n<LI> Have processes in place to deal with problematic behaviours. Consider taking responsibility as a group, or assigning the task to a trusted person. Either way, some sort of guideline is probably helpful. Make sure the person taking on this task is accountable to the group. The guideline should be fair and transparent to all subscribers. \r\n<LI> Think about facilitating long-term involvement of subscribers. However, don\'t let this result in an increase of volume. \r\n  <UL>\r\n  <LI> Send out a weekly schedule consolidating announcements of activities, other than those the list was set up for. \r\n  <LI> Send out a weekly or monthly message with links and contact information for articles or information about other activist groups. \r\n  </UL>\r\n  Somebody needs to be responsible for compiling and sending these weekly or monthly messages out. Guidelines for what to include might be useful. \r\n<LI> Regularly evaluate the use of electronic mailing lists and the processes set up to maintain the lists. \r\n<LI> Discuss regularly if online activities influence offline group activities negatively. For example, does the group not meet or meet less? Do only few online participants attend offline activities? Are online interactions of a contentious nature? Do they result in unresolved tensions? Do they help create or maintain informal hierarchies within the group? \r\n<LI> If a discussion of a contentious nature occurs, it might be good to move this discussion offline to sort out the differences in opinion and come to a resolution that works for everybody in the group. \r\n<LI> If only few list subscribers participate in offline activities, it might be good to send out an email with a call for more offline participation, perhaps pointing out how many people are subscribed to the list vs. how many participate in offline activities, and to ask for feedback on why this is so (subscribers should be given the option to respond anonymously). \r\n</UL>\r\nThese suggestions won\'t, of course, work in all cases.

Peters life was an example of the population drift that occurs from rural areas to the developed world, a succession of moves from illiteracy to education, qualifications and skills, and no opportunities to apply those skills back home. He believed that the answer was to take information to people instead of having people move in search of information. He believed that digital technology could enable a practical and cost effective approach to improving educational and employment opportunities in rural areas like his home.   \r\n\r\nDespite Peters tragic premature death in Nigeria in December 2000, his vision has continued to grow and develop. Individuals and groups are developing to take on and extend the many roles he initiated. The OOCD (Oke-Ogun Community Development Agenda 2000 Plus committee) has taken his role as local champion. CAWD, with its history of supporting his vision, and its access to information and technical expertise, is enabling the project from the connected side of the digital divide. Personal communication links between Nigerians in London, and the community in Oke-Ogun, help OOCD and CAWD, and strengthen the foundations on which the project is being built. \r\n\r\nIn Oke-Ogun the information network relies largely on word of mouth, through the village markets, the weekly meetings for religious worship, and the trading networks between the village markets and urban centres. The main urban centres have telephone lines and public e-mail access. Some e-mail and telephone communication is possible between the urban centres and the UK, but web access is virtually impossible. \r\n\r\nIn the UK access to the internet is easy, so contacts can be made and information can be collected on behalf of the project. \r\n\r\nContact between Nigeria and the UK is enhanced when people visit friends and relatives in Nigeria, and physically carry internet printouts, videos and letters between the two countries. It is not instant online access for the OOCD committee and it is not video-conferencing, but it is a step in that direction. \r\n\r\nTogether the OOCD and CAWD are clarifying Peters digital bridge vision of providing Community Digital Information Centres (CDICs) linked to a community radio station. \r\n\r\nPrior to building the ICT infrastructure, or information highway,  information traffic is flowing in both directions. The OOCD is recognising how the community could benefit from online internet access. CAWD and OOCDs  shared awareness of potentially useful  information traffic is increasing. Later this information traffic will flow through the community network, to and from the CDICs and the linked radio college, and through the wider connected community.\r\n\r\nFor the information highway CAWD UK is researching appropriate technology while the OOCD is discussing ideas with local government chairmen, gaining support and finding appropriate locations. \r\n\r\nThe first objective is to provide the OOCD with online internet access instead of printouts generated in the UK. The vision goes much further, as outlined above. \r\n\r\nThe speed of implementation will depend on the resources the project can attract, but we anticipate an incremental approach, growing in response to expressed needs of the community.', 'The Oke-Ogun digital bridge project combines a technology led approach (from the connected side of the digital divide) with a needs driven approach (from the rural communities and their representatives).  This has been achieved by recognising the value of existing human communication networks in the rural areas, beyond the reach of the telephone network. The fact of population drift from rural areas to the developed world adds to the scope of the network. From the beginning the project has involved a human network ranging from the multi-cultural community in the UK to peasant farmers in distant rural Nigeria.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-11-29 15:27:40', '2006-08-05 19:30:06', NULL, NULL, 'CAWD', NULL, 71, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Physical public spaces, as arenas for a wide range of  interaction and social change are losing their importance, as the global marketplace has shifted its locus from the accessible public markets to the dispersed and elusive global networks.', 'In the era of mass homogenization of branded public spaces around the world, we propose a research into the historical examples of sustainable urban spaces that focus on dynamics and diversity in the social, biological and cultural domains. The examples of such public spaces are community gardens and pocket parks, non-institutionalized plaza and street life, travelling fairs and periodic festivals. From these spaces, we learn about ways of conducting an alternative economy based on emergent trans-local actions, rather than accepting the generic, mono-cultural approach of the global free-market.', 'We propose two projects: Hubbub and GroWorld as case studies for a pattern that deals with sustaining trans-local diversity in the social, organic and cultural domains. This pattern is based on the assumption that social interaction and exchange can take advantage of the information technologies to augment site-specific urban contexts with a layer of pliant digital media, that can be shared between several localities and communities. By developing (elements of) spaces that can be seen as autonomous, \'alive\' entities, the public arenas acquire additional layers of interaction (human-human, human-built space, human-media space...), that can yield unexpected social participation.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nHubbub, a project developed in the Topological Media Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology, is an investigation of how accidental and non-accidental conversations can by catalyzed in urban spaces by means of speech projected onto public surfaces. Hubbub installations may be built into a bench, in a bus stop, a bar, a cafe, a school courtyard, a plaza, a park. As you walk by a Hubbub installation, some of the words you speak will dance in projection across the surfaces according to the energy and prosody of your voice. We\'ll capitalize on recognition errors to give a playful character to the space. Hubbub\'s success will be measured by the extent to which strangers who revisit a hubbub space begin to interact with one another socially in ways they otherwise would not. Hubbub is a part of a larger cycle called URBAN EARS, which explores how cities conduct conversations via the architecture of physical and computational matter.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nGroWorld is an initiative that started within FoAM in Brussels.  It encourages multidisciplinary discussions, bringing different research topics into a common focus: \'growth processes\' in (physical and virtual) life. GroWorld is currently developed in three parallel trajectories: ecological, technological and socio-cultural. The trajectories are mutually independent, but complimentary, with their results being integrated into several experiments.  The ecological strand involves building a trans-local network of public gardens concerned with preserving local bio-diversity,  grown by scientists, landscape architects and neighboring communities. The gardens are sites evolving on their own accord - becoming patches of autonomous organic wilderness in the midst of an urban jungle, grown and molded by their care-takers and temporary dwellers. They are devised both as growing environments in which the visitors can comfortably linger, surrounded by specific local flora, and instruments allowing their players to collaboratively shape and steer the environment\'s processes of growth, decay and transformation.  GroWorld\'s cultural trajectory comprises artists and designers interested in \'biomimetics\', learning from nature to design responsive spaces and objects. More specifically, this strand examines growth processes in audiovisual media, textile design and human computer interaction and applies this research in mixed reality installations, a-life gaming environments and smart textiles. Simultaneously, the technological strand develops responsive media, technologies and interfaces for social interaction, information and entertainment. Its results should be accessible to different communities and should be adaptable for several social, biological and cultural contexts - adaptable to both indoor and outdoor spaces, different climates and cultures. \r\n<BR><BR>\r\nBoth Hubbub and Groworld are phenomenological experiments, that are built upon symbiotic collaboration between different cultures and disciplines.

E-education is but another context for surveillance.', 'One means of power, the invasion of privacy, is to coerce the observed by denying them the right to see their observers. Twentieth-century philosopher Michel Foucault describes this discipline as panopticism, ', 'Our society is one not of spectacle, but of surveillance We are neither in the amphitheatre, nor on the stage, but in the panoptic machine, invested by its effects of power, which we bring to ourselves since we are part of its mechanism (Foucault 217).\r\n\r\nFreely roaming in cyberspace and virtual reality gives the individual a sense of command over time and information, but as people work, learn and play in cyberspace, they are subjected to more control and supervision than in other modes of communication.  Jennifer S. Granick, in the July 1998 issue of Wired, states that new technology makes surveillance quite easy, as there are few protections for the consumer.  She points to the study by the American Management Association in 1997 that found two-thirds of major US companies electronically monitor their workers (86). Stephen Doheny-Farina describes one such device in his book The Wired Neighborhood (1996).  This technology called ubiquitous computing includes the ability to track an employees location at all times.\r\n\r\nWhen we climb into shared folders, download assignments, and surf the Web, data are gathered directly and indirectly about us.  From what feels like privacy, we participate in on-line chat rooms, leave a message on a bulletin board, shop online, and register with a commercial site. With more classes and degrees offered online, education is becoming consumer oriented.  Knowledge is now considered a content commodity. Students have a sense of being in control with access to information anytime and anyplace.  Ironically, in cyberspace we are more visible and open to surveillance.  Whether students are forming virtual teams, collecting information on the Web, or participating in distance education, they are under observation, as are we all. The exercise of power in cyberspace may lack documentation; nevertheless, it pervades this virtual community without walls. \r\n\r\nThere is a sense of privacy, autonomy, or control over one\'s learning as hypertext removes the restrictions inherent in linear text.  Certainly pulling information from the Web or an intranet and pushing e-mail from a remote source, at any hour, in the privacy of one\'s own home gives the user a sense of control and psychological distance.  However, as Bentham prescribed, the tower is in the center, be it the Web or the professor opening shared files or a student tracking system. The cells, \"small theatres, in which each actor is alone, perfectly individualized and constantly visible\" (Foucault 200) are the computer terminals, the defining physical space.  Those in the tower can use the latest Web-based classroom management tools to track every connection, edit a file/folder, download transcripts of chat rooms and bulletin boards, or simply observe without being seen.  Computerized forms, identified by one software management company as the Student Record Summary Sheet, track the time the student has spent online, noting log on and log off.  This process recalls the characteristics Foucault attributes to the panopticon: enable the observer to calculate the time taken to perform a task, to note laziness, to evaluate the aptitude of the observed, to judge performance, to assess success and to classify the observed.  \r\n\r\nAcknowledging and understanding this panoptic schema may enhance procedures for team building in this new environment. Those confident in their dual roles as observers and observed become independent learners. The ability to be self-directed frees them from power struggles that beset most collaboration.  Self-confidence allows them to appreciate cultural differences, individual reflection, and group reinforcement.', 'Exploring privacy statutes as well as privacy common law provides a context for ensuring students recognize the extent to which they are under observation in an online course. Initially, the focus is on disclosure issues. For instance, a syllabus should highlight the ramifications of tracking procedures provided by course management software such as WebCT or Blackboard. Contractual agreements offer another strategy for verifying the students acceptance of the surveillance inherent in a web-based course.

These gaps are described in terms of distinct social groups, which are often based on ethnicity, geographic location and socio-economic status. While these discussions are critical for understanding the diffusion of information technology, these lines of inquiry do not extend critical attention to social inequalities that are deeper than descriptions of who has and who lacks access, and how various social groups use information technology. We use the term digital inequality to represent the pattern of reproduction that maintains historical social hierarchies through access to and use of new information technologies.', 'The digital divide and its associated difficulties did not suddenly appear in contemporary society. Entire communities in the US, particularly in the inner cities, are not only economically, but also historically disadvantaged. From this perspective, the digital divide cannot be explained as a technological artifact, but rather as a contemporary source of inequality. Attention must also be paid to the broader economic, institutional, social and cultural inequalities that exist in our society.', 'Information technology is often conceptualized from a tools perspective that focuses on technical apparatus such as computing hardware, software, data, and communication facilities. However, different actors will use these technical apparatus in different manners, in different times, and in different places (Kling, 1999).  This highlights the relevance of the social and cultural context of use.  Social and cultural contexts provide legitimate purposes, reasons and support for using the technical apparatus.   Consequently these contexts also provide a grounds for dividing practices which create categories such as  haves and have nots, the digerati and the people of no account (PONO) . One ramification of these dividing practices is the creation of a penal society where judges of digital competence are everywhere  in government, in workplaces, in schools, in peer social groups, and even in homes  and those lacking digital skills become censored from an ever-growing number of societal institutions that provide entrée to improved life chances.  Thus information technology becomes institutionalized as digital skills and technical prowess proliferate and become taken-for-granted.The institutionalization of information technology occurs largely through discourse.   A discourse is a group of statements that provide a language for talking about a particular topic at a particular historical moment (Foucault, 1979). Discourse is more than just linguistic systems or texts that produce meaningful and regulated statements. Discourse constructs the topic. It defines and produces the objects of our knowledge. It governs the way that a topic can be meaningfully talked about and reasoned about. So, for instance, when analyzing statements about the presence of a digital divide, historically underserved communities are inserted into the information technology discourse as have nots. There will always be groups of people that do not to use information technology, but the power of discourse named, defined, and created the subject of a have not. This discourse is disseminated, and our thoughts about the digital divide are structured in a manner that maintains existing inequality.  Non-users of information technology become a subject to be singled out for conversion (i.e. technology training) and punishment (i.e. penalized by labor force for not having technical skills). Underlying this discourse are deterministic tendencies and pro-innovation biases that often lead us to believe that people ought to adopt information technology since it is good for them.  Consequently, we create institutional structures such as community technology centers to facilitate the desired behavior.   While the availability of local access and training facilities enables participation by those who might otherwise not have access, it also makes it much easier to blame non-participants for their situation, and to threaten them with economic sanctions and social exclusion.   However, this shows a type of historical amnesia whereby we have selectively forgotten about the poor state of the public school system, the relative lack of employment opportunities, and the limited availability of affordable daycare that also beset these communities.  For some, these past lived experiences create existential wounds and emotional scars which can lead to nihilism, a disease of the soul where there is little hope for the future and little motivation for struggle (West, 1994).  Nihilism can lead actors to self-exclude, which reproduces inequality by leaving information technology exclusively in the hands of the majority .   For others, these past lived experiences are surmountable and they do in fact become engaged with information technology.  However they tend to participate at a disadvantage because, as prior research demonstrates, their information technology use is often structured by institutional, social, cultural and economic factors (Kvasny, 2002; Lentz, Straubhaar, LaPastina, Main, & Taylor, 2000), (Rojas, Roychowdhury, Okur, Straubhaar, & Estrada-Ortiz, 2001).    We know, but often do not take into account, that people are not treated as equals in the institutional spheres that affect their life-chances: in their education, in their work, in their consumption opportunities, in their access to social services, in their domestic relations, and so forth. These same inequalities structure information technology use. In the hands of historically underserved communities, information technology is often seen as a vehicle for social inclusion and \"catching up\". In the hands of the majority, the communicative resources provided by information technology border on monopoly because it is flexible in its application, it allows for great ideological plasticity, and it lends itself to established institutional purposes. Thus, the increased diffusion of information technology does not necessarily imply greater democracy and social equality.  To the contrary, we argue that increased information technology access and use in historically underserved communities facilitates positive social change as well as perpetuates the status quo.', 'In this situation, it is incorrect to think of solutions and more appropriate to think of actions that can break this reproductive cycle. We know from organizational studies that information technology has beneficial and detrimental, intended and unintended consequences (Kling, 1998), (Kling, 1999), (Sawyer & Eschenfelder, 2002).  Therefore, attempting to provide information technology solutions to age-old problems is somewhat misguided.   The implications for designing systems for historically underserved communities are twofold.  First, we contend that serious discussion of the digital divide must begin with problems of longstanding inequalities in access to life chances rather than simply access to information technology.  The digital divide policy, for the most part, has been largely confined to the issues that the have nots pose for the government and big business, and how the have nots are to be included and integrated into the information society.  The implication is that majority institutions such as corporations and governments define what it means to be a member of the information society, and everybody must simply fit in.  What this standpoint fails to acknowledge is that the digital divide is rooted in historic inequalities, which are constitutive elements of American culture.Second, the designers of the hardware, software, content and information technology training programs must take the unique characteristics of this audience into consideration.  While people consume similar information technologies, they do so in culturally informed ways.   Thus, consumption of information technology is patterned along lines of ethnicity, social class and gender (Schement, 1998), (Schement & Forbes, 2000).  Information technology, if it is to be used effectively in historically underserved communities, has to be engineered for users with different technology skills, different levels and types of literacy, and lower cost thresholds than todays typical consumer.   The challenges are in how information technology is communicated, and how it is positioned so that potential users understand what they can do with it.  And as our interactions with technology increase, the social implications of design become critically important.  Given access to the information technology, the guiding question should be:  How can information technology be used to redress and remove these historical patterns of inequality?', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-11-30 08:27:16', '2002-02-18 14:24:33', NULL, NULL, 'Penn State University', NULL, 46, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

More than ever before, educators have a responsibility to provide students with opportunities in this area.  Yet surveys show that less than 7 percent of college students meet even basic standards of global preparedness.  Less than 1 percent of American students study abroad each year, and students consistently performed poorly on global competency and geography surveys. (Oblinger, 2001). To address these issues, Metropolitan State College of Denver brought together interested faculty and challenged them to find ways to enhance the educational opportunities of students in a global environment using some of the technology that is available to many people worldwide.  This paper focuses on the results of that effort and suggests initiatives that may be of value to other institutions.\r\n	Definitions\r\n	Prior to examining this topic in detail, it is important that we provided some definitions for key terms.  The Stanley Foundation (2000) provides these possibilities:\r\n	International education refers to the body of activities that engages Americans in contact with individuals and institutions outside U.S. borders. Intercultural education and multicultural education focuses on undertakings that deal with the rich diversity of cultures within the United States.', 'Review of Literature\r\n	International education\r\n	International education has long been valued in colleges and universities, but never more so than during the past 30 years when all of us have become part of a global economy. According to Oblinger, \"Our world is interconnected; industries, products, technologies and jobs often depend on events taking place elsewhere. And according to Merryfield (2001), \"Globalization is the defining issue of our time.  We live in a world characterized by the interconnectedness of global economic, environmental and political systems, dynamic technological innovations, and increasingly complex cultural diffusion, conflict, inequities, and change.\" Imig and McKay (2001) state the need for international education this way: \r\nIn a world of increasing complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty, we will need educators who can draw upon the works of a Danish colleague who is working on cases, and a Japanese scholar who is designing assessment systems for Tokyo, on the work of Namibians who have answers about community schools and role of teachers, and Israeli scholars who know more about teaching mathematics to prospective teachers.  In turn they will need to prepare teachers who will increasingly work in changing and complex environments with little that is either fixed or isolated.\r\n	The summary of the report  ', 'Methods\r\n	On August 16, 2001 the faculty of  MSCD were called together and challenged to find new ways to enhance the educational opportunities of our students, and the college\'s ability to compete in a global economy.

Finally faculty suggested that technology competencies be required in more courses.

In addition adjunct faculty should be considered for their contributions and expertise in internationalism and technology, as well as their expertise in subject matter.

The population has been noted for an orientation toward oral communication, a highly developed sense of community place, and the perception that education is the method for sustaining that communal locale.\r\n\r\nVia a quilting metaphor, a traditional Appalachian pastime, and the epitome of multiple complex contexts of creation and utilization; we can conceptualize more specific situated and efficacious patterns for educational technology networks and evaluation.  By piecing together the patches of rural life experiences, communal senses of place, the old/new pedagogies and teachers technological competencies;  a new quilt of technological efficacy may emerge, specifically designed to bridge the digital divide in Appalachian higher education communities .   \r\n\r\nAppalachian regions have much in common with other culturally distinct\r\nregions of the world that continue to be bypassed by the information and communication technology (ICT) revolution. Appalachia has a pervasive history of resistance toward modern approaches and technological innovation more typically manifest in cosmopolitan and suburban areas (DeYoung, 1994). Mainstream educational buzz words such as constructivism, problem-based learning and on-line virtual community building may be commonplace in contemporary urban learning environments, yet these terms retain an aura of mystery and a history of under-utilization in traditional rural Appalachian institutions.\r\n\r\nAppalachian practices in respect to education, work and leisure have been\r\nlabeled by many outsiders as evidence of the existence of an oppositional culture, characterized by contradictions, insularity and backwardness. For example, rural Appalachian populations in Ohio and West Virginia have been found to place more value upon oral communication, to be more attached to a sense of community place or locale, to perceive education as a method of sustaining a situated community, and to engage in smaller-scale organizational efforts than urban populations (Howley, 1997).\r\n\r\nEquitable accessibility is an important issue in Appalachian.   For instance, high-speed Internet access is readily available in urban and outlying suburban communities.  However, even if Internet access is available in Appalachia, it is generally available via telephony, resulting in slower-speeds and reduced capabilities for up-to-date information acquisition and technological efficacy.  According to Samarajiva (1999), Internet connectivity should be implemented via the more innovative high-speed broadband and wireless technologies, since voice transmission technologies are less flexible and adaptable for the needs of developing software and hardware.\r\n\r\nThus, in order to alter Southeastern Ohio attitudes toward digital technologies, the Appalachian sense of community should be seen as a building block, rather than a something to stumble over.   The College as a community hub can be used as a place where learning can be enhanced in ways that are sensitive and in harmony with local Appalachian cultural practices. Successes in this region can offer models for other rural, isolated, and technologically-challenged communities across the globe.', 'The pattern proposes a research design situated within the constructs of diffusion of innovations, constructivism and the efficiency/creativity functions of technology.  Initially, an exploratory analysis of technological innovators is proposed, thus, two to three previously identified  technological innovators from within member institutions of the Ohio Appalachian Consortium for Higher Education (OACHE) will complete a survey instrument designed to measure their perceptions regarding the level(s) of technological efficacy exigent in their particular institutions; becoming facilitators and change agents in identifying the unique institutional faculty characteristics and cultural values relevant for technology adoption and efficacy in their communities.  A series of tutorial workshops and collaborative approaches designed to bridge the old traditions with the new will help alleviate institutional and faculty concerns regarding infrastructure and personal implications and autonomy issues, while concomitantly fostering a sense of unity and community. These workshops will integrate old and new pedagogies and technologies, and optimally, faculty will be empowered to learn individually and collaboratively within familiar locales, accompanied by their community peers; thus narrowing the gap between traditional and modern, novice and expert.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-11-30 14:05:22', '2006-08-05 19:24:55', NULL, NULL, 'University of Rio Grande & The Ohio State Universi', NULL, 119, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This skewed development, which fails to address the digital divide in a meaningful way, tends to perpetuate the very gap governments allegedly seek to bridge. It also creates unhealthy dependence of developing countries on suppliers of information infrastructures.', 'While the digital divide has indubitably emerged as a serious form of social inequality in many societies and there have been varied and creative responses to it, in the developing countries, responses from governments have been generally tied to meeting structural imperatives. Resources both from local and foreign donors and creditors have been massively directed at acquiring computers and IT infrastructures as well as at promoting computer literacy at various levels of education both formal and informal. This development comes as a kind of catch-up effort on the part of developing countries; otherwise, they are presumably doomed to the vicious cycle of poverty and under-development. For instance, the UNESCO once estimated that for the Philippines to be globally competitive, at least 65% of its citizens must be computer-literate.', 'Such an otherwise well-meaning injunction on a developing country may, however, do more harm than good if it does not come with culturally and socially-sensitive measures.  By far, computer literacy in developing countries is often associated with government target quotas in producing or retooling workers for various economic sectors, improved productivity in manufacturing sub-assemblies and labor sub-contracting. While these can be legitimate goals of governments, projects in computer literacy also need to mitigate the social imports that the whole \"computer culture\" brings: labor and market efficiency, means-end connectivity, mass productivity--values and assumptions that are not necessarily shared in project sites. It doesn\'t come surprising, indeed, that computer literacy has remained an alien and alienating experience for masses of people in developing countries. Largely the resulting experience has so far been dependence on suppliers of computers and IT infrastructures. Software and hardware dominance comes from developed countries whose leaders only recently pledged to help poorer nations (a charming thought indeed if only it doesn\'t perpetuate the cycle of dependence the actions of these rich countries have so far created). Contents flowing on Internet infrastructures continue to be dominated by media conglomerates that tend portray computers and technologies in overly-glorified ways, thus, increasing frustration when such technology \"come down\" to developing countries.', 'For computer-literacy programs to be meaningfully successful, they need to be aligned with the goals of communities in developing countries (which of course need not exclude some of the systemic goals set by their governments). So far there have best practices in this respect. Depending upon diverse contexts, these practices may have features including (but not limited to):\r\n\r\n1. more emphasis on computer-literacy as communication-enhancing skill, enabling people to reach more people and hear from more people outside the immediate limits of the community where they belong; initially less on computers as tools of productivity; \r\n\r\n2. more emphasis on computer-literacy as <i>a process</i> (which can be a very long one) of learning new things with machines; less emphasis on computers as number-crunching, word-processing, media-spinning machines;\r\n\r\n3. more emphasis on what people in the community can do together with machines to find (and act on) better ways of sustaining individuals, families, and groups (not necessarily in terms of jobs which are of course also important); less on technical competencies that make one \"computer literate\";\r\n\r\n4. more emphasis on creative ways of sustaining existing communicative practices of individuals, families, and communities; less on fancy \"high tech\" media delivery which is, more often than not, unaffordable to most people in developing countries.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, as far as \"solutions\" go in real life, they cannot be static or permanent.

We define Code as the hardware and software of information technologies.  Code is important, because it is a means of regulating behavior in cyberspace.  It is analogous to the law of cyberspace.  In discussing online societal concerns such as free speech, privacy, and trust we must consider the role of code.  Our research seeks to provide a better understanding of code.\r\n	One aspect of our project is to understand the origins of code.  Code is not produced in just one institutional framework, but in a number of different ones.  These institutions include universities, firms, the open source movement, and consortia.  To study these institutions we chose four historical case studies.  They are:  NCSA Mosaic developed at the University of Illinois; cookies developed by Netscape; the Apache web server developed by the open source movement; and the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  Based on these case studies, we have analyzed how these institutions tend to embed different values in code.  \r\n	We found that code is materially affected by the institution it is developed within.  For example, firms tend ignore unprofitable societal concerns in the design of information technologies.  For example, when Netscape introduced the cookies technology, it did not attempt to design the code to consider privacy.  Instead, it focused on how cookies could be used to generate revenue through electronic commerce.  However, other institutions, such as the open source movement do consider unprofitable societal concerns in the development of code.  This led us to develop some normative proposals to ensure code meets the need of society.  It is these normative proposals that we seek to present.', 'The design of information technologies is important and within society\'s control.

It now appears that the availability of information technology may outstrip demand. Some parts of the US lag in the rate of adoption and use of IT by organizations, institutions, and individuals, even though broadband Internet access is becoming widely available. Research suggests that without strong, IT-savvy leadership, easy to use, and patently useful information tools, adoption will be limited. This situation can be addressed via a program to inform community leaders about the IT, to identify, organize, and engage technologists in community development, and to facilitate community IT projects. Digital development is the process of applying computing and telecommunications to the challenge of community economic development.', 'Information technology', 'Digital development involves three components, IT facilities, the skills and talents of individual citizens, and the capacity of local organizations to produce and adapt (see Figure 1). These components are complementary and best developed together incrementally via a series of discrete, meaningful projects. Such projects require effective community technology leadership. Leadership links community goals to action, supplying the opportunity and motivation for talented citizens to participate by building IT solutions for their community (see Figure 2). \r\nMost communities have little awareness of a key component of digital development: individuals with some talent or predilection for technology, their technologists. The challenge then is to identify the technologists, facilitate project dialog among stakeholders about what can and should be accomplished using IT, and locate project resources. The role of the catalyst is to build support for projects among business and civic leaders, engage technologists in the process, and then let them do the project for themselves. The digital development value chain is a link in a larger learning process, in which competence and capacity are incrementally improved via guided experience, leaning by doing. In order to be effective, the digital development process must be:\r\n&#9642;	Flexible and customized to each community\r\n&#9642;	Broadly inclusive of stakeholder objectives and challenges\r\n&#9642;	Broadly inclusive of talent and potential technology leadership\r\n&#9642;	A list keeping of technologists and projects\r\n&#9642;	A resource brokering of subject-matter experts and tactics\r\n&#9642;	A partnership between community-oriented persons and organizations\r\nThe digital development process involves identifying opportunities for using IT in the community, cross-training leaders and technologist, and organizing stakeholders for collective action on projects. At the crux, it is up to some community members to decide to do a project, what project to do, and to actually do it. For those communities interested in pursuing digital development there is a wide variety of tactics from which to choose.', 'Each community is unique, a unique set of people with unique resources, opportunities, objectives, and challenges. Thus digital development services must be customized to each community, which is to say that the community is the customer for the catalytic agent. Such customization can only be accomplished through a partnership with a community sponsor, community supportersbusiness and civic leadersand community technology leaders. This team is responsible for choosing and implementing a project. During the project subject-matter experts, in funding, technology, management, et cetera, may be brought in to supplement the team. \r\nFor digital development to be effective objectives must be clearly defined. Then existing demand and expertise is aggregated via an alliance of technology users. Leaders and technologists need to learn more about each other, more about what IT is, and more about how to use it. Basically, technologists are activated to lead projects that put IT to work for the community, but the leaders provide them with guidance and support. \r\nCommunity technology leaders are first and foremost community members. They live in the community and are committed to it. They also have some expertise, talent, or just an interest in information technology. Finally, these individuals must be willing and able to lead projects, which involves understanding community requirements, gathering and managing resources, devolving objectives into tasks and getting other to do those tasks.\r\nTactics for digital development might emphasize the technology itself, skills related to the technology, applications that enable organized activities, or some combination of these things (see Table 1). Tactics should be considered in terms of community goals. Is there some consensus about a particular use for IT? This would require a tactic focused on defining an IT architecture and/or deploying an IT application. Or is the concern primarily with technology skills? If so use a tactics that makes citizens more aware of, and improves their ability to use, existing IT. Often the concern is simply with making facilities more available or to increase access, and there are tactics that concentrate on these objectives.\r\nTable 1.

The output is a set of tactical, action-oriented recommendations, it is a broad consideration of where the community is today, where it might want to go in the future, and how IT may be used to help it get there. Data for the assessment is gathered during a focus group with representatives of the various community stakeholder groups. The results are read out to a similar group. The dialog resulting from these sessions are a key output of the CTOA, as well, because it is this dialog that begins building collective will to do a project. \r\nTechnology Alliance Start-up Kit\r\nPossibly the most effective means of doing digital development is to aggregate existing demand and pool talent and expertise. A technology alliance accomplishes both of these objectives. The start-up kit contains a blueprint for an alliance, including boilerplates for by-laws and articles of incorporations, but more importantly it includes logistics for monthly meetings of technology leaders. Each meeting consists of a splash topic of interest to the group, a showcase of a local user, a forum for sharing technical information, and updates on projects. The primary outputs are the meetings, a list of technology leaders, and information tools (e-mail list, website, newsletter, et cetera). The start-up kit establishes an environment in which technologists can bond and work on projects.\r\nTechnology Leadership Training\r\nA community must be able to talk the talk and walk the walk of technology in order to make digital development projects successful. Possibly the most challenging component of this is informing existing community leaders about not only what IT is, but what it means for them and their community. Often theyve heard the jargon being thrown around and are baffled by it. They want the terms explained to them in a non-threatening manner, but they really need to know the implications of usingor not usingthe technology. Its somewhat easier to introduce the technologists to leadership, especially if its done in the context of professional development. The program consists of several sessions over several months, and is structure such that leaders and technologists are being cross-trained and planning a community technology project in the process. \r\nProject Management Assistance\r\nThe community teams will need at least some assistance to complete the project, from identifying best practices to locating resources, from conducting research to guide projects to measuring their results. General assistanceadministrative and logistical support, in particularcan be provided by community sponsors and other local groups. Project specific assistance may need to be provided by subject-matter experts. An array of resources is available to support community projects, the challenge lies in tapping into and coordinating them.

There may be significant barriers to both taking up and using the service, including: little existing interest, fear of the technology itself, fear that the technology will be used to spy on them, and disbelief that the service is free. Even for those who profess the positive power of the technology there may be no personal motivation to take up the service. Just because the technology is taken up, doesnt mean it will be used. Again, lack of interest and fundamental skills may discourage use. The technology might not fit the subscribers habits, or it could have technical limitations and/or problems that discourage use. There are also questions about whether most individuals with use a technology without clear purpose or encouragement from an opinion leader.\r\nPublic information infrastructure such as LaGranges requires significant investment, a solid long-term strategy, and partnership with private sector entities. Internet TV would not have been possible without the historic precedent and preceding initiatives. While the Internet TV initiative shows some evidence of improving skills and economic opportunity, it is unclear whether those improvements are significant or systemic. Positive results from Internet TV might be intangible or long-term. And it would be nearly impossible to disassociate any clear results from a host of other socioeconomic factors. Regardless, contemporary social context seems to be making effective information managementand tools and skills needed for such activitiespractically mandatory. In such an environment, information infrastructure can be argued to be essential for modern life, and characterized as non-rival and non-exclusive in consumption. This provides the conceptual basis for publicly provisioning connectivity, information, and information tools. The City of LaGrange has demonstrated that it can be done economically. This pattern suggests that some sort of public information infrastructure is necessary for a community to prosper in the 21st century.', 'The primary relationships in this pattern are local and public-private. This is an example of blurring, or at least flexing, the lines between industry and municipality, of both cooperating to meet a common objective. The locality of the pattern appears to be a necessary element of such efforts. Locality allows for longer-term efforts, of which Internet TV was but one. It also allows for focused, small-scale experiments, which can be scaled up or down with relative ease. Both of these situations support shared learning among participants. This is the fundamental value of locality: it facilitates repeated interactions based on shared needs, resulting in learning opportunities not only for the citizens, but for City officials and Charter, too. \r\nThe other relationship, implicit to this pattern, is that of individuals to information tools. Basically, this pattern is all about closing that distance, making the relationship closer and more meaningful. The man-machine relationship can be very chaotic and complex. Some people love technology for its own sake, but most dont. Many appear ambivalent towards or fearful of computers. And its insufficient just to have ready access to technology. There can be huge psychosocial barriers to using whats available. These barriers are overcome by relationships: with leaders, and to specific, highly valued goals or activities. Thus vital factors in public information infrastructure are locality, public-private partnership, widespread use by leaders, compelling uses for the populace, and social connection between the leaders and the populace by which usage habits can be transmitted.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-01 10:05:03', '2002-01-28 07:00:03', NULL, NULL, 'Georgia Tech', NULL, 121, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Note that the pattern at issue here is not the roles <em>of</em> media, but participant roles <em>in</em> media.', 'This problem applies to all communication media (systems of communication) that enable people to interact with each other, whether in the network context or the general (including face-to-face, human mediated, paper-analog-based, electrical, and broadcast) media contexts.  It is of particular interest for establishing generic design patterns across media, including patterns associated with operational and support workflows, and opportunities for computer and networked human mediation in support of media instances operated by individuals, teams, and small and medium sized organizations.  Not all roles occur in all media. Indeed, there are patterns of association of specific association of roles with specific generic media types.  Because virtually all communication, networked or otherwise, occurs within the context of media (systems of communication), this pattern is rated as high in invariance.', 'An understanding of the communication process must take account of both the language that communicators use to construct and understand messages and the media they use to deliver and receive them. Existing contextual theories of communication contribute to our understanding of these elements, but ignore the substantial commonality that exists in interpersonal, live presentational, small group, organizational, static presentaitional, correspondence, publication, broadcast, and other communication contexts.  The roles that are associated with our use of media provide one of these commonalities.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be relatively unexplored ground.  See Foulger (2001).\r\n\r\nIt can be argued that the question of generic roles was one of the first areas for which assumptions were made in forming the modern field of communication. Shannon\'s model of the communication process includes two such generic roles (sender and receiver).  Almost all introductory textbooks in the field of communication make reference to this and other related models, including the interactive, transactive, and gated models of communication.  All of these models make reference to variants of the sender and receiver role.  One makes reference to a third role, the gatekeeper.  These roles are presented as being common to all (or in the case of the third role, many) media, but are assumed to be self-evident.  They are rarely discussed in any detail.\r\n\r\nTexts associated with \"mass\" communication frequently make reference to specific roles in specific media, often within the context of career possibilities or a \"typical\" organization chart (e.g. directors, writers, and camera operators in motion pictures; producers, talent, and recording engineers in music recording; editors, correspondents, and rewrite desks in newspapers; program directors, news reporters, and engineers in radio). Little or no attention is paid to the similarities between these roles across these different media. A similar pattern can be observed in discussions of interpersonal media. Although there are discussions of roles within specific interpersonal contexts (including McLean\'s 1957 categorization of roles in groups, Brody\'s (1991) taxonomy of stakeholders in organizational environments, various organizational communication network roles), no attention is paid to the similarities between these roles in different media (managers, account executives, and secretaries in business correspondence; chairpersons, meeting participants, and recording secretaries in committee meetings; judges, witnesses, and court stenographers in judicial proceedings). \r\n\r\nThe increasingly complex communication media environment set up by networked computers increases the value of understanding the generic roles associated with media.  Education of communication professionals, for instance, is generally isolated to a few key media (e.g. journalism, radio broadcasting, television broadcasting).  The range of media is exploding, however.  It is not reasonable to expect that we can have professional education that targets each network medium.  Role commonalities and media design patterns provide a way of creating generalized programs that train people to work in a variety of related media.  The design of media and implementation of media instances are another place where the generic role patterns may be important.  Can we really afford to rediscover the lessons of older media in newer media because we haven\'t learned the generic problems and solutions associated with related roles and workflows in other media?', 'At least nineteen generic roles can be identified that are associated, in various combinations, with different media.

Material texts are highly differentiated by location and as material objects. But existing knowledge of material texts in the real world often doesn\'t simply transfer across to the Internet.  Beginners need to construct models for themselves of the new kinds of superficially undifferentiated texts (e.g. websites, email) they encounter and how they work, and also construct mental maps of how these texts are being produced in, and fit into, the real differentiated world.  They need to recognise what\'s likely to be of use to them, and feel confident about their ability to make selections and judgements. Most importantly, they need to find meaningful social contexts, both online and offline, for engaging with the Internet.\r\n\r\nLearning to use the Internet therefore involves becoming familiar with a whole set of new literacy practices. In recent years literacy studies theorists (e.g. Brice Heath 1985, Street 1995) have shown that reading is not just decoding, and that literacy always has a social context. While people in better-resourced, more affluent circumstances can afford to take their time and let their understanding of the WWW, the Internet, and cyberculture develop gradually, as their Internet usage continues or increases,  people on beginners\' courses are anxious to progress quickly and feel they have a lot of catching up to do. Their initial lack of experience of browser interfaces, hypertext and even of computer keyboards obviously puts them at a disadvantage. Their lack of experience of the world of online texts compounds this, as this world isn\'t visible to non-users in the same way that material texts are.\r\n\r\nTo counter this feeling of disadvantage, and also to resist the far from neutral bids for their attention that they will encounter online, beginners need to mobilise their existing real world knowledge. Tutors need to know how to help them through the complete process of becoming skilled, confident, demystified, social users. In the time they have, beginners need to do a lot more than simply acquire some technical skills. To continue as confident users they must find their own communities of practice, for as Agre (1996) puts it, \"Knowledge lives in communities, not individuals. A computer user whos not part of a community of computer users is going to have a harder time of it than one who is.\"', 'We need to get beyond the notion of \"configuring the user\" to adapt to the technology.  People becoming Internet users are having to develop new literacy practices, and new understandings of them. They need to find their activities purposeful in the widest sense, and experience themselves as participants in a new social context. The tutor\'s role needs to include facilitating this wider learning, by helping students build conceptual models and create their own understandings within contexts that are meaningful for them. Literacy studies theory has much to offer here. Educators can not only help people learn what to do when they sit at a computer, but can help them work out for themselves \"what\'s going on here?\" as social actors.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-01 15:36:20', '2006-08-05 19:26:46', NULL, NULL, 'University of Sussex', NULL, 120, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This is a satisfying result insofar as it turns the traditional dichotomy between interpersonal and mass media into a continuum that includes a variety of network-based interpersonal mass media. It is an unsatisfying result in that it denys the essential uniqueness that inheres to these networked computer media.', 'This observation appears to apply to all known networked computer media.', 'Characteristic-based media taxonomies, like those provided by Bretz (1971), Ciampa (1989), \r\nFoulger (1992), and Hoffman and Novak (1996), provide a useful starting point\r\nfor describing understanding the relationships between media.  Indeed, Foulger\r\n(1992) proposes that they can provide a window through which the capabilities\r\nof new media can be understood, and through which the possibilities for new\r\nmedia can be projected.  The very different taxonomies of Bretz, Ciampa, Foulger,\r\nand Hoffman and Novak each list a wide variety of media (28 for Bretz, 35 for \r\nHoffman and Novak, at least 43 for Ciampa, and 52 for Foulger) and organize \r\nthem in interesting ways.\r\n\r\nTaken in aggregate, these sources suggest that it may be useful, at least for \r\nsummary purposes, to group human communications systems as follows:\r\n\r\n<i>Propinquitous Interactive Media</i>, including Intimacy, Face-to-face Interaction, \r\nSocial Dancing, Small Group Interaction, Brainstorming, Family Interaction, \r\nParticipatory Games and Sports, Classroom discussion\r\n\r\n<i>Live Presentational Media</i>, including Speeches, Lectures, Town Meetings, Judicial \r\nProceedings, Ritual Ceremonies, Legislative Assemblies, Mobs, Theatrical \r\nPerformance, Bonfires, Political Rallies, Live Musical Performance, \r\nSporting Events, Puppet Shows\r\n\r\n<i>Static Art Media</i>:  including Cave Paintings, Bas Relief, Oil Paintings, \r\nDioramas, Quilts, Pottery, Sculpture, Architecture, Animatons, Photographs, \r\nFilmstrips, Holographic Recordings, Signs, Billboards\r\n\r\n<i>Correspondence Media</i>: including Letters, Notes, Memos, Business Correspondence, Telewriting, \r\nTelegrams, Telex, Facsimile, Tape Letters, Personal Video, Recorded \r\nTelewriting, Electronic Mail\r\n\r\n<i>Publishing Media</i>:  including Books, Daily Newspapers, Magazines, Video Recordings \r\n(Videotapes, DVD Video, etc.), Weekly Newspapers, Journals, Recordings \r\n(Records, CD\'s, Cassettes), Newsletters, Merchandise Packaging, On-line \r\ninformation, Online databases, Online services, Electronic Publications, \r\nMultimedia Documents (VideoText)<i>, </i>Billboards, Direct Mail Advertising, \r\nMicroforms\r\n\r\n<i>Telephonic Media</i>:  including  Telephone, Teleconferencing, Intercom, C.B.

Many are also visible in a\r\nsimilar two-dimensional representation by Hoffman and Novak (1996).  Although\r\nneither resort to pictorial representations, both Bretz (1971) and Ciampa (1989)\r\ncapture a number of these groupings in their tabular summaries (<a href=\"http://www.oswego.edu/~dfoulger/research/bretz.htm\">Bretz</a>; <a href=\"http://www.oswego.edu/~dfoulger/research/ciampa.htm\">Ciampa</a>).\r\nAlmost one hundred media are identified above, and the interested reader \r\nshould have no trouble identifying more, including a variety of additional\r\nnetworked computer media.  The interesting question, however, at least for the moment, is not what is\r\nmissing, but what is in the middle.  In both the Hoffman and Novak (1996) and \r\nFoulger (1992) characteristic-based typologies, computer and network based media\r\nreside in the middle ground between, in particular, correspondence, telephonic,\r\nbroadcast, and publishing media.  Most networked computer media show an\r\naffinity for one or another of these clusters.  Some, including hypermedia and\r\ncomputer conferencing systems, don\'t show such affinities.\r\n\r\nThis is a satisfying result in many respects.  Almost all media that exist prior\r\nthe arrival of networked computer media fall fairly cleanly into the category of\r\neither interpersonal medium (e.g. propinquitous interactive, live presentational,\r\ncorrespondence, or telephonic) or mass medium (e.g. publishing, dynamic art, \r\nbroadcasting, or static art).  Only Ham and Citizens Band radio suggest any\r\ndifficulties with the dichotomy (e.g. they broadcast interpersonal content).\r\nNetworked computer media, however, destroy any illusion that the interpersonal \r\nand mass media content can be treated dichotomously.  Computer conferencing and\r\nweb hypermedia, in particular, are both intepersonal in aspect and mass in reach\r\n(potential audience size and persistence).\r\n\r\nIt is also an unsatisfying result in some respects.  Tom Novak, in a private\r\ne-mail, comments:  \"I don\'t really believe this conclusion.   It suggests to me \r\nthat the variables used to classify media don\'t include any dimensions on which \r\nthe Web is truly different.   That is, the key dimensions that differentiate \r\nthe Web are being left out.\"  This may well be the case.  Bretz (1971) compares\r\nmedia based on five characteristics.  Hoffman and Novak (1996) use eight.  \r\nFoulger\'s (1992) typology is based on only twelve media characteristics.  While \r\nCiampa\'s (1989) ad hoc comparisons do not depend on a consistent set of \r\ncharacteristics, he does develop a between 2 and 9 characteristics (depending on\r\nhow you count) that provide a basis for many comparisons.', 'It is possible to envision a much larger set of characteristics on which media\r\ncan be usefully compared.  Indeed, a data set has been constructed that compares\r\nover 130 media on over 180 characteristics.  These characteristics themselves be\r\nusefully organized into the following clusters:\r\n\r\n<i>Characteristic Participants</i> in media.\r\n\r\n<i>Characteristics of Consumer/Audiences</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Characteristics of Creator/Performers</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Message Modalities</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Feedback Modalities</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Interface Characteristics</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Transmission Characteristics</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Storage Characteristics</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Feedback Characteristics</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Marketplace Characteristics</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Performance Characteristics</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Production Characteristics</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Message Characteristics</i>\r\n\r\nIt is thought that analysis based on this broad range of characteristics of \r\nmedia may reveal the additional dimensions of media that Tom Novak suggests \r\nwill properly differentiate the web and other networked computer media from more \r\ntraditional media.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-01 16:06:47', '2002-01-28 08:49:56', NULL, NULL, 'Oswego State University', NULL, 122, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

A conceptual understanding of this digital divide, both its statistical patterns and psychological and social-demographic underpinnings, leads us to defining the unique challenges and generating solutions that must necessarily differ from approaches more typical to the rest of the country.', NULL, 'Additional authors:\r\n\r\nLaura D.

Dowling\r\nDirector of Community Development\r\nSan Diego Regional Technology Alliance\r\nmdowling@sdrta.org\r\n\r\nAs two recent studies in San Diego illustrate, the portrait of San Diegos digital divide drastically differs from the statistical snapshot outlined in the nation-wide Falling through the Net surveys [1]. Not only are rates of computer ownership and Internet access 20-25% higher in San Diego than in the nation, but social and demographic characteristics of San Diego households necessarily modify our perceptions of the factors undermining digital inclusion. With general rates of computer ownership so high, the focus of analysis shifts to: (1) actual computer and Internet use patterns (for email, education, work-related activities, job search, banking, news, etc.) which become an increasingly important differentiating factor; (2) the transition group of recent computer and Internet newbies and wannabees overcoming a variety of social and psychological barriers to computer literacy, and (3) using the potential of high tech neighbors to support computer literacy training and otherwise ease inclusion for low income communities in the Digital Age. This new focus suggests that specific digital inclusion strategies appropriate for San Diego must differ from the rest of the country. \r\n\r\nA comprehensive analysis of digital divide and inclusion in San Diego county was made possible by two surveys that used complementary methodological approaches. The study by the San Diego Regional Technology Alliance (www.sdrta.org) used phone interviews of 1000 randomly sampled residents of San Diego county to generate a statistical snapshot of digital divide in San Diego [2], and explain computer and Internet ownership and usage patterns based on demographic, ethnic, education, income and other characteristics of households (the survey is accessible via the Sociology Workbench (www.edcenter.sdsu.edu/swb/), an online system for analysis of user-supplied sociological surveys). The survey showed, for example, that lack of both general education and knowledge about technology, especially among respondents from single parent homes, were among the prevalent factors of computer illiteracy. Ethnic differences remained strong, with African American (52% accessing Internet from home) and, especially, Hispanic (41%) households at a clear disadvantage. At the same time, an increase in household income appeared to eliminate the digital divide for African Americans, while it had less impact for the Hispanic population. \r\n\r\nThe psychological underpinnings of these and other conclusions could only be uncovered through in-depth interviews undertaken within the UCSD Civic Collaborative (www.ucsd-civic-collaborative.org/) survey [3]. This study selected respondents from among computer novices or prospective computer users in low-income neighborhoods and asked them to articulate and explain their resistances to this technology. This research explores how individual psychosocial resistances to computer and Internet use (among them: being too old to learn, fear of breaking the machine, peer expectations in a low income and not computer-savvy surrounding, low value of educational success within a particular sub-culture, etc.), are often multiplied by lack of awareness about what computers and the Internet have to offer, and how they can be accessed. The study also found that, while only a small fraction of population use Computer Technology Centers, these community-based centers support a hands-on acquaintance with computers in a comfortable adult learning environment that makes the transition to computer literacy easier for many adult users. This study concludes that the digital divide in San Diego is characterized by more of a perceptual than a material disconnect.', 'These surveys identify several general strategies for bridging the digital divide in a large high tech city: \r\n(1)	providing public access to the Internet at Community Technology Centers. While the proportion of computer users served by such centers is relatively small, these centers focus on creating a supportive environment for adult learners and easing their transition to computer literacy, emphasizing efficient and productive uses of computers and the Internet;\r\n(2)	building mutually-beneficial relationships between technology companies and Community Technology Centers. Initial investments of equipment and networking, as well as continued technological support through RTAs Digital Connections and similar programs, pay off in workforce and community development;\r\n(3)	better understanding of the psychosocial components that perpetuate the remaining digital divide through a combination of methodologically different but complementary surveys, and returning survey results and conclusions to communities via easy-to-use online analysis techniques, as well as descriptions of best practices and lessons learned. \r\n(4)	 increasing community awareness about the unique services CTCs offer residents for digital inclusion thus pre-emptively addressing individual concerns about the cost, ease of access, and relevancy of computer literacy to their lives.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-01 23:46:31', '2002-01-28 08:49:56', NULL, NULL, 'SDSC/UCSD', NULL, 124, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Ironically, approaches that combine these areas have received very little attention in theory and practice.  From among the three models of community engagement with technology  community technology centers (CTCs), community networks, and community content (Beamish, 1999)  there is a limited number of projects that have engaged community residents as active participants in using technology to define processes for neighborhood revitalization.  Conversely, from among the multitude of models for community engagement with revitalization  such as community organizing, community development, community building, and comprehensive community initiatives (CCIs) (Hess, 1999)  we are only beginning to witness the benefits that are afforded by incorporating new technologies into these approaches in a way that truly leverages their potential.', 'This pattern could be used in physical, geographic, low- to moderate-income communities.  The project that constitutes the basis for this pattern is the Camfield Estates-MIT Creating Community Connections Project, a partnership between the Camfield Tenants Association (CTA) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), started in January 2000.  Camfield Estates is a 102-unit, predominantly African-American, low- to moderate-income housing development in the South End/Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts.  The Camfield Estates-MIT project has as one of its goals to establish Camfield Estates as a model for other housing developments across the country as to how individuals, families, and a community can make use of information and communications technology to support their interests and needs.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, we have established a community technological infrastructure at Camfield by offering every family a state-of-the-art computer, software, and a high-speed Internet connection, along with comprehensive courses at the Neighborhood Technology Center (NTC), an approximately fifteen-computer community technology center (CTC) on the premises.  We have also created a web-based, community building system, the Creating Community Connections (C3) System, that I have co-designed with Camfield residents, specifically to create connections between residents, local associations and institutions (e.g., libraries, schools, etc.), and neighborhood businesses.  The project combined these elements in an effort to achieve a social and cultural resonance that integrated both community technology and community building by leveraging indigenous assets instead of perceived needs.', 'The Camfield Estates-MIT Creating Community Connections Project has employed a methodology that integrates community technology and community building as shown in the descriptive image.  The paper will describes these steps in greater detail.  The following is a discussion of the early results in relation to community social capital and community cultural capital.\r\n\r\nCommunity Social Capital\r\n\r\nI define community social capital as the extent to which members of a community can work and learn together effectively.  Increased community social capital includes: 1) reconfigured (Contractor & Bishop, 1999) social networks (e.g., broader extent, proximity and valued inhered in strong and weak social ties) as opposed to reinforcing existing ties), 2) increased obligations and expectations of trustworthiness  (e.g., increased reliance on neighbors for advice or help and other social support measures), 3) expanded access to information channels (e.g., heightened awareness of community resources), and 4) strengthened norms and effective sanctions (e.g., increased interaction among residents that inhibits negative behaviors).  The following is a summary of the early results from the post-assessment in the context of community social capital:\r\n\r\n* Social Networks: Participants have expanded their local ties.  The number of residents that were recognizable by name increased from 30 to 40 out of a possible 137 adults; the number of residents contacted via telephone and e-mail doubled (t = -1.978 ; p = 0.063); 53% of participants reported that they were more connected to family and friends in the local area.\r\n\r\n* Access to Information Channels: Participants have a heightened awareness of community resources.  The number of City of Boston services, programs, and/or departments that participants had heard of or used increased from 34 to 43; a paired-samples T test of residents awareness and utilization of community resources in nine categories resulted in a statistically significant increase in four of those categories (a fifth was nearly significant) including: residents skills and abilities (t = 3.284 ; p = 0.004), volunteer opportunities in the neighborhood (t = 3.684 ; p = 0.002), social services and programs provided for the community (t = 3.240 ; p = 0.005), community projects, activities, and events (t = 4.371 ; p = 0.000), and employment opportunities in the community (t = 1.924 ; p = 0.070); the Camfield Estates website and the C3 system received high marks from participants when asked to rate its usefulness in this regard.\r\n\r\nCommunity Cultural Capital\r\n\r\nI define community cultural capital as various forms of knowledge, skills, abilities, and interests, which have particular relevance or value within a community.  Activated community cultural capital constitutes: 1) exchanging knowledge and resources (e.g., formal or informal sharing of information, products, services, etc.), 2) improving technological fluency (Papert & Resnick, 1995; Resnick, Rusk & Cooke, 1998) and the ability of community members to express themselves via technology (e.g., the ability to create a personal website that portrays a particular interest such as books), 3) coalescing around shared interests (e.g., a group of mothers discussing effective child rearing practices), and 4) shifting individuals attitudes and perceptions of themselves and the world (e.g., renewed confidence in their abilities, their capacity to learn, and their appreciation of assets in their community).  The following is a summary of the early results from the post-assessment in the context of community cultural capital:\r\n\r\n* Knowledge and Resources: Participants are better informed about local issues and there is an improved communication and information flow at the development.  Almost half of participants (47%) reported that they are more aware of what is going on at Camfield when compared to before the project was started; this was partly due to the fact that a core group of residents and staff have taken the lead in actively contributing to the Camfield Estates website and the C3 system; the most popular C3 modules were the resident profiles (31% of traffic), calendar of events (18% of traffic), and discussion forums (13% of traffic) on the Camfield Estates website, and while these modules experienced moderate use, their traffic has steadily increased since the site went live.\r\n\r\n* Attitude and Perception: Participants have cultivated the meta-competence of a renewed confidence in themselves and their ability to learn.  Qualitative responses from the one-on-one interviews revealed a shift in participants attitudes and perceptions of themselves as learners.  Several participants described their personal transition of moving from a reticence toward technology to envisioning themselves as (or taking actual steps to becoming) web designers, network administrators, and programmers.  In particular, their participation in the training has given them a greater appreciation of their strengths, and it has given the community a greater appreciation of its most basic assets, the skills and abilities of its residents.', 'Since its inception, the Camfield Estates-MIT Creating Community Connections Project has sought to integrate community technology and community building by drawing upon the theories of sociocultural constructionism (Pinkett, 2000) and asset-based community development (Kretzmann & McKnight, 1993).  However, the community technology movement, primarily in the form of community technology centers (CTCs), and the community building movement, primarily in the form of community-based organizations (CBOs), have historically existed in separate, rather than holistic spheres of practice.  Leaders in both fields must devise strategies to connect these two movements toward unleashing their collective transformative power.  For this to occur, the following things must happen:\r\n\r\n* Theories must be developed.  This paper will offer the theoretical framework of sociocultural constructionism and an asset-based approach to community technology and community building, which represents just one of a growing number of theories dealing with these issues.  There is both a need to further develop this perspective by applying it in different contexts toward different outcomes, and a need to establish new perspectives that suggest alternate approaches which can also be explored.  Such a strategy can simultaneously serve to broaden and deepen our understanding of these issues.\r\n\r\n* Research must be advanced.  The Camfield Estates-MIT project is one of a growing number of initiatives seeking to demonstrate the role of technology for community revitalization (Kirschenbaum & Kunamneni, 2001).  These other examples fall into the categories of advocacy and online organizing, community information clearinghouses, networking and online communities, innovations in service delivery, interactive database development, and community mapping (Kirschenbaum & Kunamneni, 2001), and are beginning to grow in number, size, and scope.  We must to continue to study and highlight examples of community technology and community building projects as a means to disseminate lessons learned and advance our understanding.\r\n\r\n* Practices must be changed.  Community technology practitioners must connect their activities to more traditional, outcome-driven program areas such as youth, workforce development, and health care  as these areas also represent more established and stable sources of funding.  Community building practitioners must closely examine the role of technology in improving their organizational effectiveness and supporting their efforts to reach out to the community  as such an examination also holds the greatest promise for identifying new innovations in the work they perform.\r\n\r\n* Funding must be shifted.  There are a number of grant programs that will provide money for hardware or software only, without associated funds for the necessary courses and training required to make productive use of these tools.  Conversely, there are a number of grant programs that will provide money for specific programs, such as youth development or improved delivery of health care, without simultaneous support for technology development and infrastructure.  Community technology and community building initiative requires funding that allows them to pursue an integrated and comprehensive agenda.  Although both movements combined would benefit from additional resources, and easier \"win\" could be achieved by simply leveraging existing resources more synergistically. \r\n\r\n* Policies must be altered.  For example, the federal E-rate program that provides subsidized telecommunications services to schools and libraries, should be extended to nonprofit organizations.  In short, government must acknowledge the inherent synergy between programs aimed at bridging the digital divide and those aimed at alleviating poverty.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-02 13:34:18', '2002-01-28 07:00:03', NULL, NULL, 'Building Community Technology (BCT) Partners, Inc.', NULL, 127, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

During its stay on earth, it has changed the world dramatically through social and technological innovation. In spite of great success in increasing its numbers and gaining dominion over much of the planet, the problems that humankind has created—war, famine, environmental degradation, injustice, and a host of others —may be increasingly immune to its attempts to correct them. Unfortunately there is ample evidence that the economic and political elites of the world are not able—or willing—to address these problems effectively, humanely, and ecologically responsibly. Civil society is emerging as an important force to address these problems, but in spite of best intentions, civil society efforts are often disjointed, duplicative, inﬂexible, ineffectual, and destructively competitive. \r\n', 'The social and the natural environment face profound challenges at the dawn of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Society often develops intelligent collective responses to collective problems, often through citizen activism. Civil society and ordinary citizens are often at the forefront of the creation and adoption of new paradigms, ideas, tactics, and technologies that are used to address shared problems and create a better future. ', 'In early 2003, days before the United States invaded Iraq, Robert Muller, former assistant secretary general of the United Nations, called attention to the incipient otential of the citizenry: ‘‘Never before in the history of the world has there been a global visible, public, viable, open dialogue and conversation about the very legitimacy of war’’ ( Twist 2003). He was describing the unprecedented movement that arose simultaneously in hundreds of places around the world. What this movement represents is the advent of an immensely powerful force. Muller called it a ‘‘merging, surging, voice of the people of the world.’’ And James Moore (2003), a multifaceted scholar, activist, and businessperson, called this same phenomenon the ‘‘second superpower’’ whose ‘‘beautiful but deeply agitated face . . . is the worldwide peace campaign,’’ and ‘‘the body of the movement is made up of millions of people concerned with a broad agenda that includes social development, environmentalism, health, and human rights.’’ Both are expressions of pent-up desire and a will to work for a better world, and both are manifestations of civic intelligence. \r\n\r\nTo meet the need for civic problem solving, governments, companies, nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs) citizens, and ordinary people are beginning to acknowledge the vast problems that humankind now faces and are devising new strategies, tactics, and paradigms to ameliorate them. To help with these daunting tasks, a growing array of sociotechnical information and communication systems is being developed. People and organizations need both general paradigms and speciﬁc ideas to help them devise tactics and strategies that further their objectives while working cooperatively with other people and organizations. \r\n\r\nCivic intelligence, like Daniel Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence (1995) or the various types of intelligences identiﬁed by Howard Gardner in Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983) (or even erotic intelligence, the cover story in a recent edition of the Utne Reader (September/October 2003)), is a type of intelligence, one with a speciﬁc focus; it can be used to explore and invigorate a ﬂexible and powerful competence that goes beyond the traditional notion of intelligence (which is typically equated to what IQ tests measure) in several important ways. Civic intelligence is a type of intelligence that focuses on the betterment of society as a whole, not just on individual aggrandizement. Moreover since it is a capability of society as a whole, its manifestation is collective and distributed throughout the population. The boundary between one person’s ‘‘intelligence’’ and another person’s ‘‘intelligence’’ is permeable, indistinct, and constantly shifting. Ideas in your mind today might be central to my understanding of the world tomorrow. How ‘‘intelligent’’ would one person be without interacting with other people directly (through discussion or argument) or indirectly (through reading books, watching television, or pondering works of art) or with the nonhuman world (observing nature, for example). \r\n\r\nCivic Intelligence builds on what we know about how people learn and maintain knowledge about the world and their place within it. Intelligent behavior in individuals is rich and multifaceted. It involves perception, monitoring, deliberating, remembering and forgetting, categorizing, coming up with new ideas and modifying old ones, negotiating and discussing, making decisions, testing hypotheses, and experimenting. Society as a whole engages in analogous activities, and these are embedded in our institutions, traditions, artifacts, and conversations. That these activities of collective intelligence exist is indisputable. Less obvious but also true is the fact that they are all subject to change. The idea that they could and should be consciously improved is the heart of this pattern. This recommendation is bolstered by the ﬁndings of Jared Diamond, the prominent historian and author at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has extensively studied how societies face challenges with potentially catastrophic consequences. Somewhat incredibly, Diamond’s research reveals that the ‘‘commonest and most surprising’’ of the four ways in which societies fail to address their problems is their ‘‘failure even to try to solve a problem that it has perceived,’’ even one that ultimately results in that society’s collapse. To avoid that mistake, we must go beyond examining how we as a society collectively think and take a critical look at how our knowledge and ideas are—and could be—channeled into actions. \r\n\r\nThe number of organizations exhibiting civic intelligence today is vast and growing. There were ten times more transnational advocacy organizations in 2000 then there were in 1900 ( Keck and Sikkink 1998). Not only are these organizations more numerous, but they are increasingly thoughtful and forward looking. While in the past, protest may have been simply opposed to something, it is not uncommon today for organizations to develop sophisticated analyses and policy recommendations. In an earlier exploration of civic intelligence (Schuler 2001), six dimensions were identiﬁed (orientation, organization, engagement, intelligence, products and projects, and resources) in which organizations and movements that demonstrate civic intelligence are likely to differ from those that do not. The set of attributes associated with those dimensions that tend to characterize civic intelligence organizations and movements is a ﬁrst approximation of a descriptive model of civic intelligence. Some notable examples (among tens of thousands) include the worldwide Indymedia network, the World Social Forum, the Global Fund for Women, Jubilee 2000, Science for the People, and New Tactics in Human Rights. Civic intelligence can also be manifested locally. The graphic at the beginning of the pattern, for example, shows how neighborhood art —in this case a mural about the causes and effects of asthma—can be educational and lead to political engagement and other proactive civic activities. Many of these efforts are of necessity holistic, multidisciplinary, and entrepreneurial since the people and organizations that the efforts would ideally engage with cannot necessarily be expected to do what might be considered the right thing. In an interesting turn of events, the idea of collective intelligence, which is not necessarily aligned with civic intelligence (also a form of collective intelligence), is now receiving attention from various quarters. One group, the cyber pundits, are hoping it will be the ‘‘next big thing.’’ Tim O’Reilly (2006), publisher of O’Reilly books and the man who coined the expression ‘‘Web 2.0,’’ deﬁnes it as ‘‘the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform. ‘‘There is another side of this growing interest in collective intelligence as well. This approach is less concerned with making money and more about solving global problems. While these two groups have different aspirations, both of their revolutionary visions are generally based on side-effects or technical aspects, such as new algorithms, semantic webs, or tipping points. Both groups seem to place less faith in the value of collaboratively working together and thereby trying to address the problems that humankind is facing by actually addressing the problems.\r\n\r\nA complementary model (illustrated below and described in more detail at http://www.publicsphereproject.org/civint/model-functional.html) of civic intelligence that depicts its primary functional processes has also been proposed (Schuler 2001). This model (or framework) is an amalgam of concepts from social change theory and models of education and human learning. The model is aimed at providing useful exploration in these areas as opposed to offering an algorithm or mechanism that always behaves accurately and with the prescribed result. Generally the two models are to be used in tandem: the descriptive model describes the what, while the functional model describes the how.  The functional model contains three main components: the environment, which includes everything that is relevant to the organization yet outside the organization; the mental model (or core), which corresponds to the sum of knowledge that the organization uses; and the remaining constituents of the organization, including its resources (e.g., people) and, most important, the interactive processes under the control of the organization that link the environment and the mental model. The functional model contains eight types of interactive processes that a movement, organization, or other group exhibits when engaging in civic intelligence: \r\n\r\n1. Monitoring How the organization acquires new relevant information nonintrusively. \r\n\r\n2. Discussion and deliberation How organizations discuss issues and determine common agendas, ‘‘issue frames’’ ( Keck and Sikkink 1998), and action plans with other organizations. The mental model of any participants or the organization itself can change as a result of the interactions. \r\n\r\n3. Engagement How the organization attempts to make changes through varying degrees of cooperation and combativeness. \r\n\r\n4. Resource transfer How noninformational resources like volunteers and money are acquired from the environment. \r\n\r\n5. Interpretation of new information How new information is considered and how it ultimately becomes (or does not become) part of the core. New information can also include information about the organization. \r\n\r\n6. Maintenance of mental model (includes resource management) How the organization maintains its organizational integrity by consciously and unconsciously resisting change over time. \r\n\r\n7. Planning and plan execution How a campaign is initiated, carried out, and monitored. \r\n\r\n8. Modiﬁcation of mental model How the core itself is scrutinized by participants in the organization and modiﬁed. Another term for this is organizational learning. \r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of each of these processes will help determine the effectiveness of the entire organization. For that reason, it is important to develop surveys and other types of diagnostic tools that can help organizations use the civic intelligence paradigm effectively. This information could be key in evaluating actions or developing plans. Some of the other uses of this knowledge are inventorying civic intelligence initiatives of geographical regions or thematic activist areas, convening interorganizational workshops, designing curricula, planning campaigns, or even developing new organizations. One of the most important uses of this information is metacognition: examining and evaluating how the processes are used within an organization and changing them as necessary. \r\n\r\nThe physical, social, and intellectual environment is changing rapidly. Intelligence, more than anything else, describes the capacity to inﬂuence and adapt to its environment. Organizations with civic missions have the responsibility to keep their principles intact while interacting effectively with other organizations, both aligned with and opposed to their own beliefs and objectives. \r\n\r\n', 'An effective and principled civic intelligence is necessary to help humankind deal collectively with its collective challenges. People need to develop and set into motion theories, models, and tools of civic intelligence that can help integrate thought and action more effectively.

Unfortunately, this is all too often not the case. One group builds a \"solution\" for another group without fully understanding the culture, the user needs, the extreme cases, and so on.

The tribe had as one of its members, a man who took it upon himself to learn all that he could about wolves. He became such an expert, that his fellow tribespeople called him \"Wolf.\" While Wolf and several other braves were out on a long hunting expedition, it became clear to the tribe that they would have to move to a new location. After various reconnaissance missions, a new site was selected and the tribe moved. \r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, it became clear that a mistake had been made. The new location was in the middle of the wolves breeding ground. The wolves were threatening the children and stealing the drying meat. Now, the tribe was faced with a hard decision. Should they move again? Should they post guards around the clock? Or, should they destroy the wolves? And, did they even want to be the sort of people who would kill off another species for their own convenience? \r\n\r\nAt last it was decided they would move to a new location. But as was their custom, they also asked themselves, \"What did we learn from this? How can we prevent making such mistakes in the future.\" Someone said, \"Well, if Wolf would have been at our first council meeting, he would have prevented this mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough,\" they all agreed. Therefore, from now on, whenever we meet to make a decision, we shall ask ourselves, Who speaks for Wolf? to remind us that someone must be capable and delegated to bring to bear the knowledge of any missing stakeholders.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch of the failure of \"process re-engineering\" can be attributed to the fact that \"models\" of the \"as is\" process were developed based on some executive\'s notion of how things were done rather than a study of how they were actually done or asking the people who actually did the work how the work was done. A \"should be\" process was designed to be a more efficient version of the \"as is\" process and then implementation was pushed down on workers. However, since the original \"as is\" model was not based on reality, the \"more efficient\" solution often left out vital elements. \r\n\r\nTechnological and sociological \"imperialism\" provide many additional examples where the input of all the stakeholders is not taken into account. Of course, much of the history of the US government\'s treatment of the Native Americans was an avoidance of truly including all the stakeholders.\r\n\r\nA challenge in applying the \"Who Speaks for Wolf\" pattern is to judge honestly and correctly whether, indeed, someone does have the knowledge and delegation to \"speak for Wolf.\" If such a person is not present, we may do well to put off design or decision until such a person, or better, \"Wolf\" can be present. \r\n\r\nAs a variant of this, a prototype creativity tool has been created. The idea is to have a \"board of directors\" consisting of famous people. When you have a problem to solve, you are supposed to be reminded of, and think about, how various people would approach this problem. Ask yourself, \"What would Einstein have said?\" \"How would Gandhi have approached this problem?\" And so on.', 'Solution: Provide ways to remind people of stakeholders who are not present.  These could be procedural (certain Native Americans always ask, \"Who Speaks for Wolf\" to remind them) or visual (e.g.,diagrams, lists) or auditory (e.g., songs).

They can often lead to the attitude, \"Well,  since I can\'t solve such a problem, I will simply ignore it.\"  In fact, a common practice in business circles is to use \"World Hunger\" as an epithet for a problem so complex and diffuse that there is no point in addressing it.  \r\n\r\nYet, clearly issues of this magnitude do need to be addressed.  Typically, in the tradition of 19th and early 20th century science, the approach to a complex problem is to break it down into subproblems and then solve each of the subproblems.  For example, one might break down the problem of world-wide pollution into problems of chromium pollution, lead pollution, etc.  Such analytic techniques, however, do not work well for inter-related systems. In addition, such an approach still seems overwhelming to the individual.  I would have to gain access to information about how to change my behavior with respect to lead, to chromium, etc. and then actually institute those changes in order to make a difference.  This seems a daunting and lonely task.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative proposed here (but certainly not invented here) is to leverage the power of Communities including geographic communities, communities of interest, and communities of practice.  Many such communities already exist.  They have developed mutual trust and a common ground.  Leaders exist within these communities.  They are already capable of dealing with systems problems.  \r\n\r\nA community of practice in psychology might not know much about nor have much directly on reducing chromium pollution.  But what they do know about and can make a contribution to is using psychological principles to making people aware of the long-term consequences of behavior and of facilitating behavioral change.  A community of practice of lawyers may not know much about, nor be much interested in lead pollution, but they might enjoy and be quite knowledgeable about legal remedies to encourage compliance to existing laws and they may also be knowledgeable about drafting and passing new legislation.  \r\n\r\nIn solving complex systems problems by engaging a community of communities, the idea is not to construct some huge centralized plan that everyone must conform to (detailed centralized planning does not work as the Soviet experiment taught us).  Rather each community within the community of communities needs to set its own goals, define its own issues to focus on, make use of the special knowledge and talent that exist within that community.  \r\n\r\nRepresentatives from each such community may nonetheless find it useful to inform each other of their plans, make suggestions, trade tips and so on.  This can help increase the level of synergy among community plans and increase the effectiveness of each community as well.\r\n\r\nAdditional reviewers/editors: Alison Lee, Catalina Danis, David Ing, Ian Simmonds\r\nEarth photo courtesty of: \"Visual by www.PDImages.com\".', 'Develop a ring of rings.

(419, 400, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'As Herb Simon (1962) pointed out in the \"Architecture of Complexity\", a common heuristic for dealing with complexity is to break complex problems into smaller, more or less independent components.  When a complex organization is broken down into smaller units (such as divisions, departments, teams) each unit specializes.  People are selected, trained, and motivated to optimize the performance of that unit.  However, there remains the necessity for coordinating across units to deal with changes, exceptions, and errors in organizational design. In these cases, it is necessary for human beings to solve problems across organizational boundaries.  However, since people in different organizations have been selected, trained, and motivated differently, such conversations are often very difficult.', 'Context: Organizations strive to become more efficient partly through automation and partly through specialization of function. Organizations train one group of people to perform a function and then \"hand off\" the process to another group trained to perform another function, etc. \r\nIntegration often extends across formal organizational boundaries so that; e.g., various participants in supply chains attempt to coordinate their efforts.  Such larger scale integration can result in greater efficiency.\r\n \r\nSystems are not designed, however, with complete knowledge of every possible contingency. When design assumptions break down, it is important for people on both sides of a functional boundary to have a cooperative conversation in order to solve the problem left by the gap between reality and the design assumptions.', 'Forces:\r\n\r\nMany processes are too complex to be understood in detail by one person.\r\nPerformance on a task is generally a logarithmic function of time on task.\r\nA person\'s time is limited.\r\nComplex systems are typically designed and built by decomposition. \r\nSystems to automate, semi-automate, or coordinate are generally designed by people who are not the people who actually do the tasks.\r\nDesigns can never anticipate all contingencies.\r\nHuman beings can negotiate to solve novel coordination problems via conversation.\r\nPeople find conversation in the service of finding and solving problems rewarding.\r\nPeople are subject to forming \"in-groups\" and \"out-groups.\" \r\nIf \"in-groups\" and \"out-groups\" are formed, rather than negotiating a solution to a problem that is globally optimal, each group will try to \"win\" by forcing the solution that is optimal for their subfunction.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nHistorically, many organizations have recognized the need for such informal conversational ties and have provided both special places (Officer\'s Club; Traditional Pub; Company Cafeterias) and events (Company Picnics; Religious Retreats; Holiday Parties; Clubs) to facilitate such interchanges.  As organizations attempt integration across ever wider scales however, providing appropriate venues becomes increasingly challenging.\r\nIn some cases, two related functions report to a single manager and the manager may serve as a communication bridge.  Clearly, however, in complex organizations, formal management methods alone will be insufficient for coordination across all the boundaries. \r\nWhen links in a processing chain do not converse, inefficiency results.  For example, telecommunications company Customer Service Reps gave out credit card numbers to business customers.  However, they had to get these numbers from the accounting department.  The customer service reps were only allowed to make outbound calls between 12 and 1.  The accounting department generally had lunch between 12 and 1.  As a result, it was often many days before customers were able to begin using their business accounts.  The accounting department and the customer service reps also disliked each other, had no informal contact, and when other coordination problems arose, generally blamed each other.  \r\n\r\nThe same general difficulty arises in attempting to deal with any complex problem; e.g., attempting to voluntarily and democratically facilitate social change.  For instance, in the pattern, \"Community of Communities\" it is possible for various communities to develop plans that inadvertently interfer with each other.  That is why it is useful, on a regular basis, to have conversations that cross community boundaries.\r\n\r\nAt IBM Research, I used to play a lot of tennis with other IBMers including an inter-company league.  Here, I met someone in the corporate tax department named Frank. \r\nI also used a system which returned the abstracts of scientific and technical articles that contained key-words of interest.  Such systems return many false positives.  One in particular had nothing whatever to do with my interests; it was about a new federal program that allowed highly profitable companies to trade tax credits with companies that were losing money.  Instead of throwing this in the trash, because I had had conversations with Frank, I forwarded him the abstract. He looked into this program and saved a lot of money for IBM. This case illustrates that ideally even  people with no obvious process connection should be able to converse informally. \r\nIn planning the first Universal Usability Conference (ACM SIGCHI), it was necessary to delegate various functions to various parties.

Once people had mastered that, they were transferred to the much smaller production size.  This eliminated the \"age effect\" and in fact, both older and younger people learned much more effectively and efficiently.  \r\n\r\nIn similar fashion, we argue that trying to solve a complex problem with virtual strangers, especially when there is reason to believe there may be a difference in agendas, is a \"tangled problem.\"  Untangling the getting to know people from the complex task will help insure ultimate success. \r\n\r\nSome care should be given to the task and setting.

Current public policy in Canada and the United States is driven by an ideology of information technology that narrowly defines universal access strictly in terms of connectivity to promote economic development. Issues of intellectual property, access, government information policy, cultural identity, and so forth are delineated within economic parameters ignoring civic, cultural, and educational needs social and individual needs. It is proposed that a right to communicate, first enunciated in the late 1960s, is required to address this broad range of public policy issues within the current evolving global telecommunication environment. Furthermore, the right to communicate also provides a framework for a new concept of the library as an institution that provides public spaces embodying all the elements of the right to communicate.', 'Universal access has been a longstanding public policy concept and objective arising out of the development of telephony. During the closing decades of the twentieth century a prevailing ideology of information technology led to the re-formulation of this concept into a narrow objective of connecting consumers as opposed to citizens to the information highway for the sole purpose of economic development. A cluster of rights relating to privacy, intellectual property, and access to information, intellectual freedom, and so forth are framed within this economic framework. This public policy framework has distorted the objective of such public spaces as libraries.  The library\'s role of serving civic, educational, social, and cultural needs has been constrained while the library is expected to focus on advancing economic development and to provide access to the information highway mall for those who cannot afford a computer in the household. The library is transformed into a social welfare agency to serve the disadvantaged trapped on the wrong side of the digital divide (Birdsall 2000).\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is a new conceptual policy framework that addresses issues of access, intellectual property rights, intellectual freedom, and so forth in the new electronic environment that recognizes these are rights of citizenship and not just consumer rights.  This conceptual framework should offer as well an alternative to the outmoded concept of universal access. Finally, it should also be a new conceptual framework for the role of the library in the twenty-first century.', 'Since the beginning of the 1960s efforts have been made to formulate and entrench in international agreements a right to communicate. Such a right provides a new conceptual framework for the pattern of rights associated with communication: privacy, access, intellectual freedom, assembly, language, etc. It provides a new vocabulary and alternative to the outmoded concept of universal service.  \r\n\r\nThe conceptual framework of a right to communicate also provides a way to develop a new concept of the library that divorces it from the traditional concepts of a material library as place or the more recent digital or virtual library. (Birdsall 1994)Instead, using the right to communicate as a conceptual framework, the library is conceived as an institution embodying a pattern of rights constituting the right to communicate: access, privacy, assembly, language, intellectual freedom, intellectual property, cultural identity.  The library is an institution, then, that promotes and insures a public space for the practice of citizenship regardless of what material or virtual form the library takes.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-10 10:06:45', '2006-08-05 19:22:58', NULL, NULL, 'Novanet', NULL, 140, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Those that are put on display are either on public machines in a gallery, in which case the physical presence of the computers themselves unintentionally become a part of the artwork, or on machines in media rooms, where the art is relegated to a utility space. In fact, Internet art may have no place in physical museums, and require instead a virtual space where visitors can separate the aspects of their haptic environment from the artwork. \r\n<p>\r\nThe Internet has not only inspired new forms of art, but also creative ways of navigation and information dissemination that may augment the experience of physical works. A physical art museum limits the visitor\'s ability to explore tangential experiences -- in a virtual space, one might look at a representation of The Victory of Simothrace, note that it adorned a ship, think of Viking ships and, with little effort, immediately navigate to a site detailing the ships in the Roskilde Viking Museum. If mediated through a coherent shell, the ease of transition in Internet spaces could lead to serendipitous, creative juxtapositions. \r\n<p>\r\nIt is undesirable, then, for an Internet museum to take on exactly the characteristics of a physical museum.

People need places where they can feel at home and hang out for extended periods without the need to spend lots of money. Unfortunately there is a scarcity of what Ray Oldenburg calls \"great good places\" that are convenient and welcoming. In many regions of the world people have forgotten how to \"hang out\" with friends, a lost art that refreshes the spirit and &mdash; sometimes &mdash; leads to social action as well.', 'This pattern is applicable to any place where people live. Whether a community is rich or poor, it needs \"third places\" where people comfortably congregate.', '\"The right of free assembly is the most natural privilege of man.\"  Alexis de Tocqueville (1963)\r\n\r\nThis pattern makes the case that probably shouldn\'t even need to be made; that people <i>need</i> the physical  presence of others and that <i>virtual spaces</i> however important and vibrant they can be, have not made physical meeting places obsolete. \r\n\r\nAlthough situations are different in different locations, the fact remains that communities need what sociologist Ray Oldenburg calls a \"great good place\" or \"third\" place which is a physical location, more-or-less public place, where people can \"hang out\" and talk about whatever they need to talk about.  Unfortunately these locations are threatened in many places. Many factors can contribute to the decline in great good places. Some neighborhoods may be dangerour or have a mistrusting atmosphere. Some may be too economically disadvantaged to be able to afford a safe place with a roof overhead. Moreover in the era of television and the car, the art of spending time around people that might be strangers may be dying. Other locations may have such high rents that it becomes necessary to cycle customers quickly to increase the \"efficiency\" of the cafe.\r\n\r\nOldenburg discusses many instances of the role of the \"great good place\" in history. These include German beer gardens in the US in the early 1990s, Viennese coffee shopts, French cafe society and the like.  It also discusses the fascinating role of taverns etc. in the development of the journalism, the media, business practices, and social change &mdash; including the American revolution against the British. Oldenburg quotes Sam Warner (1968) who states that the informal tavern groups \"provided the underlying fabric of the town, and when the Revolution began made it possible to gather militia companies quickly, to form effective committees of correspondence and of inspection, and to organize and to manage mass town meetings.\"  \r\n\r\nBradie Derrenger makes the important point that the \"great good place\" might not always be a traditional coffee or donut shop.

And  if and when other people started congregating there it might just happen that others would also do so. \r\n\r\nInterestingly it may be the case that communities with more \"third places\" are more politically and economically active. Whether this is always the case, a \"third place\" often contributes to a community\'s \"social capital\" which, as Robert Putnam has shown generally provides a wide range of benefits, including economic.', 'Communities need to ensure that \"third places,\" which are neither the home nor the workplace exist where anybody in the community is free to go and stay for as long as they want.

Many of the problems in the world are compounded by people who are unaware of the damage they are inadvertently perpetuating through their daily lives. Costs are determined in overly simplistic ways such as monetary costs or immediate convenience &mdash; throwing trash out the window or into a river, for example. \r\n\r\nNot only are these problems debilitating to people in less developed countries (thus presenting moral and ethical challenges to their more fortunate brethren), they also have a peculiar way of ultimately affecting developed countries as well (over 20% of the air pollution in the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S. has blown in from China). If people had a better idea what the entire \"cost\" of their actions were &mdash;  not just their own personal costs at that moment &mdash; there is a higher likelihood that they\'d change their behavior to encourage positive changes and discourage negative ones.', 'People in developed countries are always buying &mdash; things &mdash; often from developing countries &mdash; and are generally unaware of the legacy of the product. People may be morally opposed, for example, to the child labor that went into, say, a pair of athletic shoes, yet they implicitly condone the practice with their purchase. The one economic point of view holds is that the whole cost should be reflected in the price tag, but this is rarely possible.  Many of the costs are impossible to put a number on, and they may even differ from the point of view of different people.  (What is the \"true\" cost of taking away a wetland used by geese on their migration?)  So the pattern includes in some sense the common economic understanding but goes beyond it.  All people need to live consciously in this world.', 'In an increasingly globalized world people are connected to each other in ways that are often unknown to each other. One of the main ways that people in developed countries and less developed countries are linked is through products. When a person in a developed country buys clothing, consumer electronics, or other items all the buyer sees is a purchase price. Missing, of course, is the entire chain of lineage that was effectuated in order to place that product within purchasing range and  its enduring effects on the environment  has been dispatched of. Often the price on the product obscures a sordid legacy that could include child labor, environmental abuse such as pesticides in ground water, air pollution or soil depletion, or aspects that are harder to quantify like migration of youth to the urban areas or loss of cultural heritage. \r\n\r\nOne of the basic uses of this pattern is understanding the \"whole cost\" of an object or a service that one is purchasing. Ultimately the intent of this pattern is identifying the whole cost of something and using the information (that a single price obscures) to promote broader public consciousness and ultimately improved social good. There are a great number of ways that the information can be used &mdash; and a great number of ways left to be discovered. Ideally the information behind the price tag will take on greater significance while the price tag itself can also be made to reflect the previously hidden information more accurately including, for example, labeling that tag to include additional information about contents or relevant environmental effects or labor practices. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the \"whole cost is primarily a process of education that can be done individually (by people of virtually any age) or in more public ways through any number of ways. This \"understanding\" can be via a narrative or story or it can be more quantified, including, for example, information about who got paid how much for what at every step in the chain.  One approach is using the origin of the product as an indicator; not buying a product, for example, if it were made by non-union, child, or slave labor or because it was produced by a repressive regime.\r\n\r\nA more nuanced process with a distinctively quantitative feel is illustrated by the work done by the International Center for Technology Assessment in their \"The Real Price of Oil\" report (1998). In that report based on gasoline prices from a U.S. perspective, the authors reveal how ultimately deceptive the idea of the \"price at the pump\" actually is to the actual monetary cost expressed in a specific currency, dollars, for example. And while their approach, like other economically based approaches, ignores (or, at least, re-interprets) the human story, it goes a long way towards developing (and ultimately using) a unitary \"price\" as a meaningful attachment to a commodity or service thats available for purchase. In the case of gasoline, the authors show how multiple government subsidies (huge tax breaks, direct support for research development and other business costs, and \"protection subsidies\" often of a military nature) and a multitude of \"externalities\" (problems as diverse as air pollution, automobile crashes, suburban sprawl and climate change that are \"costs\" which the oil industry is not going to address and are not reflected in any way by the price one pays \"at the pump\") result in a public price-tag for gasoline that distorts the real price by 5 to 15 times. The \"free\" television programming that occupy so much of the time of the U.S. citizenry shows another perversion of the ideas of price and costs. The shows of course are not \"free\" at all &mdash; at least not to the viewers (and non-viewers) who pay for the ads every time they purchase something thats advertised on television. \r\n\r\nA simple use of the information (at least in the gasoline case above) would be eliminate or otherwise lower the government subsidies &mdash; especially the ones that actually hurt the environment and lead to wars and other problems and let the price creep (leap?) up to the actual price (or at least closer to it). This at the least would test the citizenrys commitment to the automobile in a fair comparison with competing approaches to transportation. A related approach is of course un-externalizing the externalities by bringing the costs back home to the companies that are making them possible. This can be done by imposing a \"green tax\" on the companies, which would be used to help try to reverse the damage caused by the companys business practices. Unfortunately, as Peter Dorman explains There is a general distrust of the effectiveness of government, a fear that green taxes will be more regressive than some of our current ones.  The alternative is the creation of environmental trusts, which would collect the money on behalf of the beneficiaries, which could include current people, future people and natural entities.  The trust would pay back some of the money directly (per capita rebates) and also finance ecological conversion.  Vermont and Massachusetts are in the process of setting up a trust of this sort for carbon and New York and California are possibly going this route too. \r\n\r\nThe city of San Francisco recently showed another innovative use of the Whole Cost concept. In the spring of 2005, San Francisco became the first city in the U.S. to enact legislation requiring the city to consider the environmental and health implications when making purchases for the city. Since the city spends about $600 million every year on a multitude of purchases (including, for example, 87,000 fluorescent light tubes) this type of legislation could conceivably have some effect, especially since city officials are hoping that the \"Environmentally Preferable Purchasing for Commodities Ordinance\" will serve as model for other cities. The city is working with community groups, technical experts and other city staff to establish criteria. Debbie Raphael, the city\'s toxics reduction program manager, stated that \"Traditionally, we have a list of specifications we use to decide which computer to buy,\" she said. \"Those specifications do not include things like how much lead is in them? Can you recycle them? What is their energy use? What it does not mean is that cost and performance is ignored. We\'re expanding the universe of criteria\"  (Gordon, 2005). \r\n\r\nA final use of the Whole Cost pattern is to consider the Whole Cost in more of a global \"whole\" way. Looking just in this the area of health reveals the importance of this approach. In a short article called \"The Price of Life\" by Glennerster, Kremer, and Williams (2005) point out that Africa \"generates less than one half of one percent of sales by global pharmaceutical firms but accounts for nearly 25 percent of the world\'s disease burden.\" The lion\'s share of pharmaceutical research and development is for the health problems of rich countries. Sadly the economic equations of the world\'s corporations exclude the vast majority of world\'s population. Lacking money, the \"whole costs\" that are borne by them don\'t show up on anybody\'s balance sheet or business plan.', 'The first thing to realize is that the price one sees on a price tag is rarely the \"Whole Cost.\" The second thing to realize is that the Whole Cost of a good or service is educational as well as inspirational. People have been very innovative in this area but there is room for much more. It\'s important to publicize the \"whole cost\" of a product as well as the monetary price.  This could include what percentage of the monetary price goes to worker and other costs to the environment, quality of life, and other important factors.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-10 15:26:30', '2007-03-11 16:58:04', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

To whom or to what will the benefit of privatizing the Internet accrue?

This private corporation has been working since November, 1998 to take over the functions of the Internet still under the oversight and management of the US government or its contractors.

In the U.S. very few faculty development programs exist to enhance faculty\'s online instructional efforts (Schrum, l995). Those that do consist of fragmented workshops or one-shot conferences on technology (Williams & Peters, l997).  This paper addresses two problems: First,\r\nthe system goal involves the introduction of a competency model of certified training of faculty.  Second, the outcomes goal involves training faculty for certification of online instruction.', 'The issues of online training of faculty resonate across the U.S.  The Professional Organizational Development Network conference addresses the issue each year in its conference proceedings(POD Conference, 2001)  The major question revolves around how to quarrantee consistency of quality in online programs.  With such a mobile student population, institutions even in the same state will not accept transfer credits from other state colleges/ universities if the course credits are for online classes (Colorado Commission on Higher Education, 2001) .  In many instances, online course credit is non-transferable.  This means that despite the many efforts of college administrators to promote online education for its convenience among other factors, these same administrators and college officials do not support the transferability of credit for online courses from other institutions.  The question of quality of instruction and control over content provides the context for much of the controversy over online course delivery.  How can quality be managed for these kinds of courses and programs?  One answer is to develop a national program of Online Instructional Certification.', 'A program of certification in online education operates on the basis of six functions that Duchastel (l997) describes as: l) specifying the goals to be pursued; 2) acepting diversity of outcomes; 3) requesting production of knowledge; 4) evaluating at the task level; 5) building learning teams; and 6) encouraging global communities.  These functions influence the development of five core competency  patterns learned by online instructors: selecting (materials, activities and courses) suited for online delivery; preparing (content for online delivery); delivering (providing instruction online); managing (handling the course online); assessing (evaluating student learning in this environment).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the core competency patterns, faculty need enabling skills (computer skills) that constitute the essential threshold to online education.  These include: selecting computer systems, creating healthy workspaces, using input devices, operating the electronic communication system in the college,using the operating system, mastering advanced features of the operating system, using voice input, selecting and using ADA input and output options, developing word processing and spread sheet competencies, etc.\r\n\r\nSustaining competency patterns represent the third variable in the model of online faculty training.  To ensure that a program of online education does not fall victim to the entropy of complacency, the training must include instruction in those competencies that are essential for creating and perpetuating excellence.  These include: evaluating the effectiveness of the online course and revising or altering the online course when and where it is appropriate.\r\n\r\nEach of these competency patterns in the model is examined in depth in the proposed presentation. \r\n\r\n			A Closer Examination of Core Competency Patterns\r\n\r\nThe five core competencies constitute the heart of the curriculum because they are what faculty do:\r\n	o  From the vast body of domain-specific knowledge faculty select the concepts, information and skills to include in their courses.\r\n	o  They prepare this material for instruction.\r\n	o  They deliver it in such a way that learners can make it their own.\r\n	o  They manage the learning experience, taking into account the mix of personality and ability among their students as well as the technology and logistics of the instructional environment.\r\n	o  Throughout the course, they assess the learning of their students, providing praise, encouragement, and corrective feedback as needed.\r\n\r\nCompetency in these five steps is essential for success in moving from purely on-site instruction to instruction that is either partially or totally online.  The\r\nfollowing sections expand on the concept of each core competency.\r\n\r\nl.  Selecting What to Put Online\r\nFaculty will inventory the courses they teach and identify materials, activities and possibly entire courses that could work well online.  This component of the curriculum will provide faculty with specific guidelines for accomplishing this inventory.  Faculty will be encouraged to work closely with their department chairs for validation of their selection of materials for online delivery.\r\n\r\n2.  Preparing the Learning Experience\r\nWith specific instructional content in mind, faculty will explore the options for preparing instruction for online delivery.  They will learn pedagogical principles and technques for making the materials they put online more effective for their students.  They will learn to make accurate estimates of how long it will take to implement their plans for preparing their materials for online delivery.  They also will learn how to work with specialists in multimedia development to produce advanced media components or even entire online courses.\r\n\r\n3.  Delivering the Learning Experience\r\nStudies of what makes for successful classroom teaching indicate that personal dynamism, energy, and the ability to make contact with learners are major components of success.  Dynamism, energy, and ability to make contact are also major factors in the success of online delivery, but the effective application of these traits requires a set of very different skills compared to classroom instruction.  Workshops in this section of the curriculum will present methods of online instruction and help faculty identify those methods that are most appropriate for their teaching style, the types of course content, and their students.\r\n\r\n4.  Managing the Online Class\r\nOne of the most frequent comments from  faculty new to online teaching is that they find it extremely time consuming.  Can one avoid being overwhelmed and still provide a quality learning experience for students?  What about decorum in the online environment?  How does the online teacher keep the tone of the entire experience on a high plane?  And what does one do if studnts start \"flaming\" one another or the instructor?  This component of the curriculum will present methods of managing the online class climate and suggest techniques for success.\r\n\r\n5.  Assessing Student Performance\r\nThe online learning enviornment puts in question many of the standard practices of onsite assessment of student performance.  what kinds of test or other types\r\nof evaluation can one offer online?  Is there any way to guard against cheating?\r\nAre proctored tests a good solution?  Can one assess students in other ways than\r\njust testing?  Can one require graded group activities in an online class?  Classes in this section of the workshop curriculum will help answer these questions by presenting options for assessing student performance in online\r\ncourses with an emphasis on alternatives to the proctored written exam.\r\n\r\n \r\n				A Closer Look at Enabling Competencies\r\n\r\nFor faculty members, equipping for the online endeavor means expanding their store of knowledge and skill to include use and mastery of the essential tools of technology.  It means acquiring and installing the essential computer system components.  It means learning how to use those components.  Finally, it means creating an ergonomically appropriate workspace and adopting healthy computer work practices. All these factors become important when the faculty member plans to handle online courses from home.\r\n\r\n			A Closer Look at Sustaining Competencies\r\n\r\nThe two sustaining competencies, evaluate  and revise, are essential to ensure that flaws and weaknesses are identified and eliminated as soon  as possible.  This is a particularly problematic area of endeavor.  Some extensive online education enterprises that have been operation for years still have not determined how to realize peer evaluation  of online instruction.  As to student evaluation of online instruction, it may be simple to implement but quite difficult to validate.  Students come to the online learning experience with widely varying expectations and levels of competency in the computer essentials.\r\nUnder such conditions, students may be incapable of differentiating between peripheral frustrations and the quality of instruction as they evaluate a specific online course and instructor.  Finally, where institutuional evaluation exists, it may be purely summative and generalized, serving as a poor tool for identifying what specific changes should be made to improve instruction in specific course offerings. Thus, instruction in the sustaining competencies will provide instructors the tools for formative evaluation and revision of their own courses as they are teaching them.\r\n\r\nValidation of the certification model results from two actions.  First, the researchers have validated the concept through experts in a conference of peers entitled, \"Teaching Online in Higher  Education Online Conference,\" November 12, 2001 in which the model was discussed and assessed by an online set of peer reviewers at the conference.  Second, a survey of the top 10 institutions with the largest enrollments where the majority of the program majors and minors are taught online is being instituted on current faculty development programs and the data reported in this presentation.  A pilot test of the model also will be initiated during the early summer months at the college through a U.S. Department of Education Title III, Activity Two grant, the funding of which the college received for the professional development of its faculty at the institution.', 'The faculty training curriculum in the model offers learning experiences that lead to certification in each core, enabling and sustaining competency. These learning experiences may be of various sorts, e.g., peer/tutoring or coaching; team teaching with certified faculty; computer or Web-based instruction; workshops; classes; and seminars.  Faculty who accumulate certification or validation in all competencies will earn \"Online Master\" certification.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-11 09:59:14', '2006-08-05 19:39:04', NULL, NULL, 'Metro State College of Denver', NULL, 146, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

However, most NPO\'s do not have the time, personnel, and/or skills to create and maintain web sites. Thus, the service-oriented information needed the most by lower income community members is often not online. In addition, many lower-income community members lack the skills necessary to effectively use web sites. Finally, data supporting the local impact of the digital divide is often insufficient or even non-existent.', 'This problem has a unique solution in regions surrounding college campuses with service-learning programs.', 'The groups most likely to be impacted negatively by the digital divide are paradoxically the groups that need access to basic service-related information the most. Quite often, members of these groups also lack the skills needed to use the Internet effectively. In addition, nonprofit organizations (NPO\'s) often have the information needed by these disadvantaged groups, but also paradoxically are unable to make this information available online. The needs of both groups are in conflict, and create a context in which it is extremely difficult for either groups needs to be met.\r\n\r\nDigital Divide Impacted Groups Needs:\r\n* easily accessible and up-to-date information\r\n* interaction with service providers\r\n* appealing design\r\n* intuitive navigation systems\r\n* training\r\n\r\nNPO\'s Needs/Lacks:\r\n* personnel to put information online while still meeting clients\' needs\r\n* additional time to create and maintain web pages\r\n* knowledge and skill to create effective web sites\r\n* funds to pay for server space or a webmaster\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is for the NPO\'s to rely on a volunteer from the community to create and maintain a website. However, relying on volunteer labor for web sites is risky, due to the turnover rate and varying skill levels of volunteers. What is needed is a pool of skilled, but cost-free, assistance.\r\n\r\nOne place to find this pool is on college campuses with service-learning programs. Service-learning is a pedagogical method designed to link course content with external experiences. Students <i>learn</i> the course-related materials through traditional learning in the classroom and through practical projects in and with the community, as well as about the reality and significance of the social issues faced by the community; while simultaneously providing a <i>service</i> to the community by meeting specific needs of the agencies or the populations with which they work.\r\n\r\nA service-learning class intentionally links the content of the course to a relevant NPO\'s goals. Students benefit from the chance to apply their skills to a real problem, and to learn about the needs of the community; while the NPO\'s benefit from the chance to have some of their goals and needs met, and to influence the next generation of leaders. In the long run, research has shown that students who take part in service-learning courses feel a greater sense of connection to their local communities, as well as an understanding of their interdependence with their neighbors. Connection and interdependence are building blocks of responsibility, and responsible citizens are in turn the building blocks of strong communities.\r\n\r\nThe initiative for a service-learning course can come from a number of different places. Individual professors can choose to use this pedagogical method in their courses, universities may require service-learning in certain classes, or community agencies may propose projects that fit with the learning objectives of a class. Regardless of the source, effective service-learning requires collaboration between the members of the community and the academic institution: it should be done WITH the community, not ON the community. The goals and needs of the community must be combined with the goals and needs of the course. This process of collaboration is often facilitated by offices on the campus specifically designated to assist with service-learning.\r\n\r\nThe service can take one of three forms.\r\n1) Direct service: students work with the community members served by local agencies. In the case of the digital divide, students in a wide range of courses could train local community members to access and evaluate online information. This training could be done at the local library, senior centers, retirement homes, elementary schools, and any other locations with the necessary facilities (connected computers).\r\n2) Indirect service: students work with the local community agencies to provide them with some needed assistance, which indirectly benefits their clients. In the case of the digital divide, students in web design courses can be required to create and/or update web sites for local NPO\'s, or run workshops training agencies representatives to maintain their own sites. \r\n3) Community-based research: students (with faculty support) conduct research for and with a local community agency. In the case of the digital divide, people trying to change the existing systems sometimes lack the hard evidence needed to prove that a problem exists. Students in a wide range of research-methods courses could conduct survey research into the impact of the digital divide at the local level. \r\n\r\nBut most importantly, the impact of a service-learning course goes beyond the immediate project: it results in changed lives. This is because a critical component of any service-learning course is reflection. Research shows that we don\'t really learning anything from experience (we often make the same mistakes repeatedly); we learn from thinking about our experiences. Students in service-learning courses are required to reflect on their experience in rigorous, thoughtful, and evaluated ways. This process drives the learning home, increasing the integration of knowledge they have gained in the present course with the way they live their lives in the future. For example, to create web sites, students must understand the agency, which means they must research the role that the NPO plays in the community, the populations that it serves, and the social issues that underlie its mission. This research helps students understand how critical access to the right information is for everyone, and how information is always related to power. Putting students in contact with members of the local community can also help dispel stereotypes. Students\' easy access to computers often leads them to mistakenly believe that the digital divide is just a \"Mercedes divide.\" Requiring students to work with underfunded and understaffed non-profit agencies, who are themselves working with disadvantaged groups, can open their eyes to the very real informational needs in the communities in which they live.', 'Service-learning provides a way to use the resources of a college or university to meet  real community needs, such as designing web sites for NPO\'s or training community members to effectively access and evaluate information online. Students can create valuable resources for the community while simultaneously becoming more aware of the social issues in that community. This ensures that once people are able to cross the digital divide, they will find the local information that they need, and not just more places to shop. This also creates the possibility for the next generation of leaders to have a better understanding of the information needs of their local community.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-12 08:59:55', '2007-03-18 16:30:42', NULL, NULL, 'Appalachian State University', NULL, 142, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Many such planning and control systems had become a bureaucratic hindrance for both employees and employers in Swedish firms. In 2002, the project, which by then engaged a consortium of researchers from four universities, had developed a quality certification method and demonstrated its viability by certifying two software packages in Sweden.\r\n\r\nThe Users\' Award network is open for employees who want to take part in efforts to raise the quality of software for use in the workplace.  The network arranges User Conferences where Exemplary software is showcased and discussed.

The critique is elaborated in the book The Invisible Computer where Norman argues that 1) the typical computer user the last ten years has been a person with substantial technical expertise, 2) that, due to the fast dissemination of IT services, the typical user in the coming years will be a person without technical expertise, 3) that this will force a fundamental reorientation upon the hardware and software industries, bringing policies of user orientation to the fore.\r\n\r\nDonald Normans analysis has been one of the inspirations for the UsersAward initiative.

Particularly in today\'s climate of declining social capital, concerned citizens find it difficult to adequately educate and organize themselves when faced with better organized and funded special interests.', 'Thousands of small towns in New England continue to be governed by the town meeting.  In these towns the town meeting -- to which every voter in the town is invited -- constitutes the legislative body of the municipality.\r\n\r\nBelow I discuss the possibilities of adding an online component to the town meeting.  I should note first, though, that the lessons apply beyond New England.  Civic governments throughout the world are required by law or tradition to hold public hearings before passing certain kinds of legislation.  New England\'s town meetings are a specific example of these meetings, but lessons drawn from them are widely applicable.', 'Fundamentally, I propose that better access to information leads to better government.  To this end, I propose an electronic meeting place where residents can educate themselves and communicate with like-minded others before the town meeting.  Not only would individual residents become better able to educate and organize themselves, the town meeting as a whole would benefit -- the dialogue would be better informed, allowing for more nuanced decisions.  \r\n\r\nSuch a meeting place might also increase levels of social capital in a community, especially among those segments most often excluded from public debates.  Recent studies have tied the decline in this crucial but elusive variable to health problems, depression and crime.  (Putnam, 2000)  Unfortunately the overall effect of the internet upon social capital is far from clear.\r\n\r\nCritics have come to dramatically different findings with respect to the impact of the internet upon social ties. (Kraut, et. al., 1998) (LaRose, et. al., 2001) (Nie and Erbring, 2000) (Wellman, et. al., 2001) In this particular respect their conclusions have seemed completely contradictory:  they note respectively that the internet has led to increased levels of depression, decreased levels of depression, increased isolation and decreased isolation.  Clearly there is currently room for reasonable people to disagree on this issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, as critics have pointed out (Nie, 2001) many studies conflate different types of internet users and different types of internet use.  Different internet tools have different effects.  It seems reasonable that an internet tool which is devoted entirely to encouraging civic interaction will, if it has any effect at all, have a positive effect on the levels of social capital within a community.\r\n\r\nIt is with this understanding that we propose an online interface to preface the town meetings.  These \"online town meetings\" will allow for a heightened level of debate, and eventually, a heightened level of understanding at the actual town meetings.  Moreover, residents will be able to actually modify the town warrant, should they build enough support around a given issue.

The proposed technology is widely available.  A system of collaborative filtering is at the heart of the system -- the more people participate in a given discussion, the higher prominence the discussion topic is given.   This gives users the power to emphasize the issues that they feel are most important, regardless of the site moderators.  \r\n\r\n     It should be noted at the outset that the online activities are envisioned integrated with a series of offline actions.  The initiative would be publicized in local papers, and public work stations would be made available in every public space within a town, along with instruction with respect to their use.  Such a real world initiative would be crucial in making the digital information accessible to all interested townspeople.

However, not only do ICT enable the experience of multiple identities, but as De Kerckhove (1997) and McLuhan (1964) point out, electronic communication media also in themselves shape and form human interaction and experience.

Projects that endeavor to help address social problems may be well served by examining historical memory and reconsidering how to respond appropriately.', 'Our memory of the past must guide the responsibility we accept in the present for the future. Without this linkage over time I could steal your belongings with no guilt or responsibility. Of course this has happened on a large scale throughout history. One group will murder, displace or enslave another and enjoy the fruits of their sins for lifetimes. Each passing day tends to legitimize &mdash; but never really erase &mdash; the misdeeds of history. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, misremembering history, is institutionalized. It\'s important to understand the motivation and the implications of intentional (let alone unintentional!) misrepresentation of history. Thus in the United States, the enslavement of Africans and the devastation of Native American communities as well as the militaristic forays of recent years including saturation bombing of civilian Japanese populations in World War II to the catastrophic Viet Nam War to the recent illegal invasion of Iraq are generally downplayed and sugar-coated. According to these re-writers of history, Americans always proceed with the best of intentions, perhaps marked by an occasional yet guileless misstep. With ubiquitous misinformation how can the next generation fully understand their country &mdash; with its successes as well as its failures &mdash; and make wise decisions in the future? Howard Zinn\'s <i>People\'s History of the United States</i> serves as an important (though still vastly underutilized) counter-balance to these trends and could also serve as an excellent model for other countries and regions as well as for various economic, political, and religious ideologies. \r\n\r\nWhat can/should people to be done to reconcile past sins and heal historical trauma? Although this question has rarely been addressed peacefully, thoughtfully and effectively throughout humankind\'s vast history, the large number of projects now in progress shows one hopeful sign of our era. According to Richard Falk, the Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany, and directed against Jews primarily as well as against the Roma, Gays, and other groups, marked a central historical marker in this regard. Since that time, movements for redress of war crimes of Japan against China, redress for indigenous people throughout the world, and tribunals and commissions focusing on war crimes and other transgressions have been launched. \r\n\r\nPeople are engaging in innovative projects that help people confront and understand and, hopefully, reconcile the present and future. Some of these examples include the courageous work of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo who publicly confront the abuse of power with photographs of \"the disappeared\" from Argentina\'s \"dirty war\" to seek justice and reconciliation with the past. Other examples to explore include the Seder ritual celebrated by Jews around the world, the post-war efforts in Germany to come to terms with their past, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission work in post-apartheid South Africa (and subsequently in many other regions), and the reparations efforts to help compensate African-Americans for the enslavement of their ancestors. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, the North Carolina General Assembly commissioned a report on an event that had been covered up for over 100 years &mdash; a violent revolt and coup in 1898 that was directed against blacks by white vigilantes in Wilmington, North Carolina. Unwilling to wait until the results of the (fixed) election took effect according to law, white supremacists seized city government, burned black-owned businesses and murdered 100 or more blacks in the streets and in their houses. According to John DeSantis, the draft report released in 2005 concluded that \"the rioting and coup fully ended black participation in local government until the civil rights era, and was a catalyst for the development of Jim Crow laws in North Carolina\" (2006). The report stated that, \"Because Wilmington rioters were able to murder blacks in daylight and overthrow Republican government without penalty or federal intervention, everyone in the state, regardless of race, knew that the white supremacy campaign was victorious on all fronts\" (DeSantis, 2006). \r\n\r\nNot only did this event disenfranchise several generations of black families in the Wilmington area but it actually ushered in a wave of similar actions and intimidation all over the South and became a model for actions in other cities including Atlanta, Georgia in 2006. Interestingly, whites and blacks were both wary of bringing this ugly historical incident back to public visibility and awareness. But what to do with the knowledge that a large number of people were brutalized and murdered (which led to a decades-long denial of basic civil rights) by a large number of people whose great grandchildren are undoubtedly still living in the region. The fact that this historical information has been sequestered for so long, especially in a region of the country that is well-known for its interest in history shows the prevalence of selective historical memory &mdash; which in itself represents many challenges for an exercise such as this. \r\n\r\nThe function of collective memory should promote healing, to set up patterns of behavior that constructively parses history to avoid  future problems and to teach each other through mistakes. The intent is not to blame or punish the descendants of people who perpetuated misdeeds both great and small &mdash; after all, who if anybody would be immune to that historical ensnarement &mdash; but to encourage people to reason together and strive for reconciliation. Ideally the descendants, especially those who have prospered since that time, would play a role in the design of mechanisms and policies to atone for and help reconcile and help redress the sins of the past especially for those who have suffered the most.\r\n\r\nIn another region and in another era, Veran Matic (2004) eloquently described the rationale why the B92 radio station he works for in Serbia, in the former Yugoslavia, keeps working the way they do. <blockquote><em> If we do not grasp our recent past, we will build our present and our future on false assumptions, beliefs and stereotypes\r\n If we do not face the errors of our past we will again seek excuses for our present in the same place Milosevic sought them  the guilt of others, global conspiracy and so on, rather than in the weaknesses of the society.  These weaknesses must be faced in order to understand reality\r\n If we do not fully comprehend our reality, reform programs will be based on false premises\r\n The problems of the repressed past will boomerang, like the permanent problem of lack of cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, or the problem of mafia and police links, or problems with the business elite who amassed their wealth through privileges granted by Milosevic.\r\n Without a radical break with the past there will be no change in the cultural model under Milosevic, which has overwhelmed the entire society, from culture, through education, to the media.\r\n Unless we face the past, we will never know what is good for us and what is bad for us\r\n By not facing the past, we neglect our duty to the future, leaving new generations to pay our debts, just as our generations have paid for the repression of the past of World War II in our country.  This gave rise to new vengeance forty years later\r\n And, finally, without engagement we will be unable to demonstrate authentic belief and strong will to institute changes that should benefit every single individual. </em></blockquote>\r\n\"Forgetting\" the past is not desirable, nor in reality is it really possible. Although Matic is speaking specifically about recent injustice in the former Yugoslavia, his message is universal. Through hard work by all concerned, healing historical wounds can be accomplished. Although it may seem impossible, those who have inherited the results of yesterday\'s actions must relive insofar as it can be done, the past sacrificing as necessary to set a more just course for the future.\r\n\r\nThe best outcome of this pattern, a valuable gift to our descendants, would be the  attenuation or, better, the cessation of current practices of brutality, exploitation, impoverishment and oppression.', 'Think about and confront memory in creative, productive and sensitive ways.

Digital literacy includes skills required to access technology as well as the ability to critically assess, decode and work within networked environments. The access/assess equation is central to the amelioration of digital divides, and includes the concept of accessibility for those with learning and/or physical disabilities.  The notion of access is crucial, not just for those with disabilities; at issue is the free and open access to information that constitutes the lived and material relations of this incipient digital era.  Cultivating communities of practice and learning networks that foster civic engagement and ensure open access and accessibility is a key step in ensuring that digital citizenship is founded upon fundamental rights of participation and engagement for the public good.', 'The access/assess bifurcation unfolds as follows:\r\n\r\nPeople with physical or learning disabilities can be excluded from online learning opportunities when learning environments are not designed according to the World Wide Web Consortium\'s Website Accessibility Initiative guidelines. This means providing an inclusive, accessible environment for learning that might otherwise be closed to people with physical and/ or learning disabilities.  \r\n\r\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) can be enabling. ICTs can provide avenues for social and cultural empowerment, and can help ameliorate digital divides based on ability, class, ethnicity, gender, and social circumstance. ICTs also enable digital pedagogies to be formed that better reflect the nature of living in a digitally networked world.  These digital pedagogies include teaching digital literacy-the ability to critically evaluate all sites of cultural production.', 'The evolution towards learning as process is replacing the old product-centered model, and will result in changing conceptions of the role of learning itself. In order to be effective and accessible, these new digital pedagogies must take issues of access and digital literacy into account when designing programs that use any sophisticated digital media.\r\n\r\nThis environmental shift towards a digital pedagogy will open up the educational process for all, provided this shift includes an emphasis on accessibility. Changing conceptions of education (towards lifelong learning) and in learning styles (with the inclusion of multiple modalities enabled through digital technology and pedagogy) will result in a more positive and inclusive social structure as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe insinuation of ICTs within the broader fabric of culture gives rise to digital pedagogies that are more congruent with the open systems of the Internet and WWW. The open source movement, supported by the philosophy of open access to information and the sharing of information and knowledge, forms communities of practice that share and work together for the public good.  This creates Open Source Learning (OSL), the theory of knowledge sharing and production in both formal and informal settings.  OSL is one way to describe how open environments of knowledge sharing for the public good create opportunities for citizens to learn about ICTs, learn how to use ICTs, and thereby learn how to find a place in the new economy. Open Source Learning environments are where digital literacy skills are taught, shared, and maintained.  When OSL communities of practice are fostered and created, digital divides can be ameliorated, accommodated, and overcome.\r\n\r\nWith Open Source Learning environments, enabling technology thus has two distinct meanings. The first is that technology is enabling to those with disabilities (accessible technology). The second is the fact that technology enables different conceptions of teaching and learning: it mobilizes or is mobilized to construct digital pedagogies. Information and communication technologies can allow access to educational opportunities for a wider audience, especially with asynchronous online delivery of curricular materials. But rather than just using online media to deliver course materials and to perhaps facilitate communication between students and instructors, these media have the potential to radically alter the very   pedagogy that underlies the provision of distance education. Accessibility is factored into building architecture from the ground up.  So too should WWW and Internet architecture account for accessibility initiatives from the outset, to ensure equitable access to online resources. In order to achieve true democracy and the democratization of knowledge, the cultural contexts within which we live must be rendered transparent. We must resist being lulled into thinking we have a democratic knowledge base when in fact we are passive consumers who have learned to live within a commodity landscape.\r\n\r\nRecognition of the socio-technical nature of ICT development and use, and the ways in which the social construction of knowledge is part of an ongoing process of living within the technologically mediated interactions can aid the formation of digital pedagogies and literacies that are community-relevant.  The increasing use of ICTs in all aspects of life influences the social contexts of technology use, as well as the manner in which social constructions of (understanding) technology are created and mediated.\r\n\r\nCommunities of practice, whether on-line or off-, are constructed, mediated, and conducted within a complex system of community exchange that is a combination of social and technological forces.  The social context(s) of learning are important aspects of socialization within communities of practice, particularly as regards open learning environments. Knowledge constructed within open environments and communities of practice is part of an ongoing interactive and iterative process within the social contexts particular to time and place. Contextual understanding of new technologies and their role in mediating knowledge is particularly important for understanding media effects and the informal structures of learning that define everyday life.', 'Cultivating communities of practice that share and foster community-relevant knowledge in an open environment can create open source learning that benefits the communities themselves, as well as contributing to the larger cultural paradigms of digital literacies and ICT use. Following the WAI guidelines for developing and designing accessible online media can help to prevent digital divides from growing disproportionately. Implementing digital pedagogies means understanding the ways in which multiple literacies come to bear on the teaching and learning process, as well as within culture in general. These multiple modalities of learning must be encouraged and embraced in order to pedagogically engage within the lived and mediated relations that we are part of each day. It also means that we encourage accessible media design so that all people can be producers of information, and not just passive consumers.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-13 12:06:03', '2006-08-05 19:22:17', NULL, NULL, 'University of Toronto', NULL, 136, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Technology can provide increased pathways for access to justice, but it can also create significant barriers.', 'The Washington State Supreme Court established the Access to Justice Board to facilitate, enhance and safeguard that access by Order of April 18, 1994.  In that Order the Access to Justice (\"ATJ\") Board was given the mission to promote and facilitate equal access to justice, and, among other tasks, to develop and implement policies and initiatives that will enhance, improve and strengthen access to justice. On November 2, 2000, the Supreme Court re-authorized the ATJ Board, charging it with responsibility to assure high quality access for all persons in Washington State who suffer disparate access barriers to the justice system. The Court gave the ATJ Board the task, among others, to \"develop and implement new programs and innovative measures designed to expand access to justice in Washington State\". \r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2000, the Access to Justice Board concluded that technological innovations and changes and their application to and adoption into various core systems in the broader society, and in the justice system particularly, were still in their early stages, and that as yet but a few waves in the justice system and access to it had been felt. At the same time, the Board recognized that a great volume of change, indeed a transformation, is building and will inevitably and significantly impact access to the justice system, indeed the very nature, functioning and products of the system itself. The Board concluded that in the absence of careful deliberation, planning, preparation and action, these enormous oncoming changes could have the destructive effects of a tsunami tidal wave, but on the other hand if this great energy of change were prepared for and constructively channeled and utilized, the public and the justice system would not only avoid significant damage but would likely garner substantial benefits for all persons to a more accessible, efficient, equitable and effective justice system. \r\n\r\nThe ATJ Board', 'Currently, technology is creating opportunities for people to use their home or a nearby library branch or community center to initiate or respond to court or other legal or law related needs, obligations or requirements, communicate and exchange documents with their legal service provider or others in or associated with the legal system less expensively, using less time and effort, without having to travel to a central city, and with less time away from work or other necessary resources. This can be especially important for the elderly, the disabled, persons with limited financial means, and those who literally cant afford to miss time from work for reasons of financial need or jeopardizing their employment. Similarly, a person with limited mobility or hearing may be able to get information electronically about his or her rights as a tenant; a victim of domestic violence can learn on the Internet what she can do and in fact be able to start the legal process of protecting herself. The courts and other parts of the justice system can operate more productively and less expensively, making court and legal records and information available and receive filings, fees, documents and information, all electronically. These are only beginning possibilities. \r\n\r\nHowever, these very possibilities also create the risk of worsening old barriers or erecting new barriers to access and causing greater disparities. While the opportunities described above seem positive, these innovations assume access to a computer, reasonable proficiency at using the machines and necessary software programs, reading capability, fluency in English and sufficient phone or cable and electricity availability and capacity at affordable cost to support the connections and streams of information and interactivity. Without all of that, those who have the tools and means, the proficiency and the phone or other infrastructure available get further ahead and those without fall further behind in having the justice system work for them. The lack of equality gets greater, not less. \r\n\r\nAs a further example, it has been proposed that the United States Code (the federal law that governs all of us) should be published electronically only - no more paper. This saves money for the government, but the content of the law is then available selectively only, and access to essential information has been made much more difficult for some sectors of society. Barriers like this already exist with respect to what is meant to be and called public information in the records of some federal agencies that are now available only electronically. Consider also a well-intentioned court-based electronic filing system which ends up giving priority attention to those who use that system (those with a computer, an internet connection and the skill to navigate what may be a complex software program) instead of those who do traditional in-person filing. \r\n\r\nThere has been talk of privatizing certain traditionally public justice system functions such as storage, maintenance and access to court files and records, which functions may be rendered commercially viable by the use of electronic digitalization, maintenance, storage and search procedures. Such discussions anticipate that while the courts themselves would not have to pay for these services, members of the public and those who represent, assist or advocate for them would be charged. Without making any judgment as to the desirability or lack thereof of some privatization, it does become apparent that without careful and enforceable standards prerequisite to any possible privatization (in this or other areas), critical parts and functions of the justice system could well become highly and disparately inaccessible to a great many individuals and major segments of the public with often significant and damaging consequences. \r\n\r\nThe foregoing are but a few issues and problems that are readily apparent. Many others exist, some already recognized, others awaiting study, discovery and solution.', 'Our solution is:\r\n\r\nTo develop, adopt and implement an Access to Justice Technology Bill of Rights premised on relevant principles contained in the United States and Washington State Constitutions, the core values of our society and its system of justice and the mission, principles, documents and declarations generated in the creation, operation and reauthorization of the Access to Justice Board. \r\n\r\nIdentify and implement the strategies, means and methods to ensure that the principles contained in the Access to Justice Technology Bill of Rights are adopted by an authoritative body, become publicly known, accepted, enforceable and effective. An example would be adoption by the State Supreme Court as a Court Rule, thus meeting the need for it becoming an authoritative and enforceable standard while maintaining adaptability when changing technologies and societal conditions require, subject to a rigorous and deliberative rule-making process. \r\n\r\nProvide an accompanying document in the nature of a Societal Impact Statement which identifies and demonstrates both the short term and long term consequences that adoption, enforcement and implementation of the Access to Justice Technology Bill of Rights will likely generate for the justice system, its consumers and potential consumers, those working in or associated with the justice system, and also for the broader society, its systems, organizations and personnel, including but not limited to libraries, community and senior centers, infrastructure needs and such.  The societal impact and consequences of not accomplishing the goals and tasks will also be identified and demonstrated.  This document should be the basis for and an incentive to develop a coherent, balanced and timely plan to prepare for and shape such consequences and meet requirements.  It is intended to stimulate, initiate, assist and enable appropriate deliberation, decision-making, planning and implementation, as well as provide an impetus to martial the societal and political will and resources to accomplish these objectives. \r\n\r\nAssure that the product is legitimate and credible by assuring that the process of developing and creating the product is legitimate and credible.  The process must enable, listen to and receive information, viewpoints and suggestions from many people and many groups representing a vast array of backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and expertise, never neglecting to include those the justice system is meant to serve  its consumers and end users.  \r\n\r\nThis effort is the first and to the present only such undertaking anywhere.  As a result, people and organizations from many other places have become involved in this effort to help produce as good an outcome as possible. They have said they want to help develop a model that other states, regions and countries may adapt and use.  This effort may also provide an example that can be used in other sectors of basic public need, such as access to health care.  The process is open to the involvement and assistance of all.  While our charge is to create an excellent result for the people of Washington State, if our process and our product is also of sufficient quality to help others beyond our borders, then so much the better.  Indeed, the happy fact is that such openness also pays the dividend of enabling us to receive the benefit of the vast and different experiences and best ideas of many others, which will in turn benefit the people of our own state.  Value is added for all.  Simply stated, everyone can win.  \r\n\r\nA great deal has been said and written about what has come to be called The Digital Divide, both domestically and internationally.

But these material systems are bound together in a flow of sustaining energy and information: the Earth-Sun-Universe connection.  It is this thermodynamic life force, this radiant electromagnetic environment, and its impacts on the body and mind, to which a sense of ecology must be acknowledged.\r\n	Information can be considered in a number of ways.  Mechanistically, information has qualities much like mass or energy.  It is transmitted and received with some force or action.  Information channels may be compared to the nerves and bones in living systems.  They are the web of social communications.  The flow of information determines the course of dynamic social evolution.  According to this view, information may be treated as a useful natural resource; a commodity that can be transported, bought and sold, and regulated.\r\n	Information, however, must also be considered as patterns of perception, relationships and differences.  In coming to terms with an ecology of the information environment,  with an ecology of the force, the message and the medium of this most natural resource, accounting for such dynamic cognitive-sensory processes must be integral to any comprehensive formulation.', 'Information ecology extends our basic understandings of ecology to the physical, social and economic transformations being wrought by the rapid developments in information technology, networking, and by our becoming an increasingly tele-networked \'society of mind\'.\r\n	The Information Revolution, as a technologically driven revolution, will likely result in increased social systematization, bureaucracy and waste.

If our fundamental motivations and desires are for a healthier, more intelligent and sustainable society, then we must invest with an appropriately reconsidered understanding of economic valuation. \r\n	Agriculture is not going away; it is evolving.  Industry is not going away; it is being transformed.  Information is not replacing these previous cornerstones of our socio-economic foundation.   It is, like water flooding our fields and turning our wheels, flowing through all aspects of society, irrigating our minds and fueling social processes, making six billion (and more) flowers bloom.

In this sense, they could be viewed as a vital knowledge infrastructure, i.e. a shared public good built by collective action; in practice, however, this vast mass of cultural meta-data is largely privatized and fragmented.\r\n\r\nAs Robert Cameron (1997) notes, bibliographic indexing is a major industry supported by large annual expenditures.

The fair outcome of the national elections may hinge in part on the design and management of computerized election ballots.  On and on, the media portray such problems.  In turn, software engineers, designers and developers must now engage not only the technical aspects of their designs but the value and ethical dimensions as well.  Yet how should they do so?

In all these activities there exists the need for explicit consideration of values, value tensions, and value trade-offs.  The Value Sensitive Design pattern can be used throughout all of these phases.  Moreover, it is expected that Value Sensitive Design will be used in conjunction with other successful methodologies (such as Participatory Design, systematic debugging and testing practices, rapid prototyping) with a variety of practitioners including software engineers, usability engineers, interaction designers, information solution professionals, and concerned direct and indirect stakeholders.', 'That technology itself determines what is to be done by a process of extrapolation and that individuals are powerless to intervene in that determination is precisely the kind of self-fulfilling dream from which we must awakenI don\'t say that systems such as I have mentioned [gigantic computer systems, computer networks, and speech recognition systems] are necessarily evil  only that they may be and, what is most important, that their inevitability cannot be accepted by individuals claiming autonomy, freedom, and dignity.  The individual computer scientist can and must decide.  The determination of what the impact of computers on society is to be is, at least in part, in his handsIt is possible, given courage and insight, for man to deny technology the prerogative to formulate man\'s questions.  It is possible to ask human questions and to find humane answers.  (Joseph Weizenbaum, 1972, p. 614.)\r\n\r\nHeeding to the call of computer scientists like Joseph Weizenbaum and cyberneticist Norbert Wiener before him, the emerging field of Value Sensitive Design seeks to design technology that accounts for human values in a principled and comprehensive manner throughout the design process (Friedman, 1997; Friedman and Kahn, 2003; Friedman, Kahn, and Borning, 2006).  Value Sensitive Design is primarily concerned with values that center on human well-being, human dignity, justice, welfare, and human rights.  This approach is principled in that it maintains that such values have moral standing independent of whether a particular person or group upholds such values (e.g., the belief in and practice of slavery by a certain group does not a priori mean that slavery is a morally acceptable practice).  At the same time, Value Sensitive Design maintains that how such values play out in a particular culture at a particular point in time can vary, sometimes considerably.\r\n\r\nValue Sensitive Design articulates an interactional position for how values become implicated in technological designs.  An interactional position holds that while the features or properties that people design into technologies more readily support certain values and hinder others, the technology\'s actual use depends on the goals of the people interacting with it.  A screwdriver, after all, is well-suited for turning screws, and yet amenable as a poker, pry bar, nail set, cutting device, and tool to dig up weeds.  Moreover, through human interaction, technology itself changes over time.  On occasion, such changes can mean the societal rejection of a technology, or that its acceptance is delayed.  But more often it entails an iterative process whereby technologies are invented and then redesigned based on user interactions, which then are reintroduced to users, further interactions occur, and further redesigns implemented.\r\n\r\nTo date, Value Sensitive Design has been used in a wide range of research and design contexts including: an investigation of bias in computer systems (Friedman and Nissenbaum, in Friedman, 1997), universal access within a communications company (Thomas, in Friedman, 1997), Internet privacy (Ackerman and Cranor, 1999), informed consent for online interactions (Friedman, Howe, & Felten, 2002), ubiquitous sensing of the environment and individual rights (Abowd & Jacobs, 2001), computer simulation to support of democratization of the urban planning process (Borning, Friedman, Davis, & Lin, 2005), social and moral aspects of human-robotic interaction (Kahn, Freier, Friedman, Severson, and Feldman, 2004), privacy in public (Friedman, Kahn, Hagman, Severson, & Gill, 2006), value analyses in reflective design (Senger, Boehner, David, & Kaye, 2005), and the place of designer values in the design process (Flanagan, Howe, & Nissenbaum, 2005).\r\n\r\nMethodologically, at the core of Value Sensitive Design lies an iterative process that integrates conceptual, empirical, and technical investigations.  Conceptual investigations involve philosophically informed analyses of the central constructs and issues under investigation.  Questions include: How are values supported or diminished by particular technological designs?  Who is affected?  How should we engage in trade-offs among competing values in the design, implementation, and use of information systems?  Empirical investigations involve both social-scientific research on the understandings, contexts, and experiences of the people affected by the technological designs as well as the development of relevant laws, policies, and regulations.  Technical investigations involve analyzing current technical mechanisms and designs to assess how well they support particular values, and, conversely, identifying values, and then identifying and/or developing technical mechanisms and designs that can support those values.\r\n\r\nHow then to practice Value Sensitive Design?  Some suggestions follow (see also Friedman, Kahn, & Borning, 2006):\r\n Start With a Value, Technology, or Context of Use.  Any of these three core aspects  a value, technology, or context of use  easily motivates Value Sensitive Design.  Begin with the aspect that is most central to your work and interests. \r\n Identify Direct and Indirect Stakeholders. Systematically identify direct and indirect stakeholders.  Direct stakeholders are those individuals who interact directly with the technology or with the technologys output; indirect stakeholders are those individuals who are also impacted by the system, though they never interact directly with it. \r\n Identify Harms and Benefits for Each Stakeholder Group.  Systematically identify how each category of direct and indirect stakeholder would be positively or negatively affected by the technology under consideration.\r\n Map Harms and Benefits onto Corresponding Values.  At times the mapping between harms and benefits and corresponding values will be one of identity; at other times the mapping will be multifaceted (that is, a single harm might implicate multiple values, such as both security and autonomy).\r\n Conduct a Conceptual Investigation of Key Values.  Develop careful working definitions for each of the key values.  Drawing on the philosophical literature can be helpful here.\r\n Identify Potential Value Conflicts.  For the purposes of design, value conflicts should usually not be conceived of as either/or situations, but as constraints on the design space.  Typical value conflicts include accountability vs. privacy, trust vs. security, environmental sustainability vs. economic development, privacy vs. security, and hierarchical control vs. democratization.\r\n Technical Investigation Heuristic  Value Conflicts.  Technical mechanisms will often adjudicate multiple if not conflicting values, often in the form of design trade-offs.  It may be helpful to make explicit how a design trade-off maps onto a value conflict and differentially affects different groups of stakeholders. \r\n Technical Investigation Heuristic  Unanticipated Consequences and Value Conflicts.  In order to be positioned to respond agiley to unanticipated consequences and value conflicts, when possible, design flexibility into the underlying technical architecture so support post-deployment modifications. \r\n\r\nNote: Much of the material in this pattern was adapted from Friedman and Kahn (2003) and Friedman, Kahn, and Borning (2006).', 'Human values and ethical considerations are fundamentally part of design practice.  Value Sensitive Design offers one viable principled approach to systematically considering human values throughout the design and deployment of information and other technologies.

Building such digital cities give a full of suggestions from information point of view to governments, enterprises, communities and individuals who are worried about economic, political and social growth and as a result, they become strong motives to vitalize physical local societies.

For example, supposing that shopping center tried to build a shopping site on the web. But it is clear that they canft flight against virtual shopping malls that have numerous numbers of shops on one site. However such shops, virtual but interactive with real existence, can put high reliability even on a virtual world by means of using high reputations of those real shops. People would tend to use such interactive shops on the web, and which promote vitalization of local shopping area. As a result, that would be able to vitalize local life cycle.\r\n\r\nIn the second context, Digital Cities can support existing cities directly by playing a role of, such as, Yellow Pate. This Yellow Page on the web could not only inform phone numbers but also locate places of a shop or to connect with its web page. \r\nOr Digital Cities can make it easier for people to get information connected to a location. For example, when people feel unpleasant smell in their residential area, and think it because of air pollution contributed by a certain factory. It would be easy to identify one factory and to check the status of control of exhaust gas immediately in Digital Cities where location and factories are connected each other on the web. \r\nOr Digital Cities could support peoplefs real life on the physical world by acquiring city information stored in the web. For example, a city might offer the blind fewer obstacles to live a life as they can get their necessity in a city easier than in suburban area. But it never means it is easy for them to go out without any helps. When they want to deal with city activities, Digital Cities linking maps of the city could support them by informing detailed city information such as signals of a street and numbers of stairs in front of them. For another example, supposing that there would be person searches information about a city he is visiting.

Digital Cities that have all elements of a city could tie individual with commercial and politics bodies, community and NGOs that usually play in different fields.\r\n\r\nIn the last context, Digital Cities could strengthen and stretch out human relations by eliminating distances and lack of interactions that often observed between government and citizens. For example, they could break obstacles and misunderstandings between local government and citizens by information disclosure, one of the advantages of information age. \r\nOr Digital Cites could stretch personal relations by supporting language and excluding physical restrictions such as distance and time lags.

Cultural exchanges and communication with language supports via network could become easier in the web than in face to face where require rich individual knowledge.\r\n\r\nDigital city can be the most fundamental approach in order to support physical social space in this network age as physical social space and digital city are complement each other.', 'Therefore, we need to build digital city as a comprehensive digital sphere which has all elements observed in the physical city.

The motivation, however, of the groups providing search engines is securing profits for their owners; other motives necessarily and inevitably take a back seat. The negative implications of relying solely on commercial search engines, though vast, are generally not recognized. If the enormous gatekeeping potential of commercial search engines is not balanced with open and accountable public approaches, the ability to find non-commercial information including that which doesn\'t appeal to broad audiences or is critical of governments and other powerful institutions could conceivably disappear. The privatization of the means to access information could also lead to a situation where advertisements and other \"sponsored\" information could crowd out non-commercial information.', 'People in their daily lives need, search for &mdash; and find &mdash; a tremendous amount of information. Increasingly, they are looking for this information in cyberspace. While Internet technology has opened up an unbelievably vast amount of information and opportunities for communication for millions of people worldwide, the very fact that we are relying on technology which is out of our control is cause for concern &mdash; if not alarm. Although the application of this pattern is relevant to any system that people use to find information, our immediate attention is drawn to the Interne which is poised to become increasingly dominant in the years ahead.', 'Access to information can be made easier; barriers to obtaining the information that people need can, at least in theory, be anticipated and circumvented. But, like the chain whose ultimate strength is determined by its weakest link, access to information can be thwarted at many levels. Although non-public (commercial and otherwise) providers of information and communication services can be \"good citizens\" who prioritize the needs of their users, the temptation to become less civil may prove irresistible if and when the \"market\" suggests that uncivic behavior would result in higher revenue. In circumstances such as those, they may decide to relax their current high standards accordingly. Big web portals are, for example, becoming increasingly cooperative with the Chinese government, presumably because of the huge market which potentially exists there. \r\n\r\nOne approach to addressing this problem, an open source / public domain classification system similar to that used in the public libraries in the U.S. and other places coupled with open source, community owned and operated search engines, is simultaneously defensive and forward looking. Defensive, because it could serve as a hedge against information deprivation and commodification. Forward looking, because this approach could help usher in an exciting new wave of experimentation in the era of access to information. As the development of the Internet itself has demonstrated, the \"open source\" nature can help motivate and spur usage in terms of the complementary tasks of classifying information and retrieving it easily. \r\n\r\nExisting classification approaches like the Dewey Decimal System also have limitations (Anglo-centrism, for example) and approaches like Dewey are not strictly speaking in the public domain (although Dewey is readily licensable). Nevertheless the Dewey system might serve as at least a partial model. Schemes that are well-known, such as the Dewey Decimal system allow everybody to communicate more quickly and with less cost. It is the open protocol nature of the Internet that has allowed and promoted easy and inexpensive ways to not only get connected, but to develop new applications that relied on the underlying, no license fee, protocols. \r\n\r\nComputing and the potentially ubiquitous availability of online environments provide intriguing possibilities that older approaches didn\'t need or anticipate. The Dewey Decimal system, for example, tacitly assumes a physical arrangement of books &mdash; the code assigned by the librarian or technicians using the system declares both the book\'s classification and the location it will occupy in the library. Although having a <i>single value</i> is not without advantages, an online environment opens the door for multiple tags for a single web page &mdash; or for finer-grained elements (a paragraph, for example, on a web page or the results of a database query) or, broader-grained <i>collections</i> of elements. A federated collection of link servers (Poltrock and Schuler, 1995) could assist in this. \r\n\r\nAs far as search engines are concerned, civil society can hardly be expected to compete with Google\'s deep pockets and its acres of server farms. Yet, it may be possible to distribute expertise, knowledge, and computational capacity in such a way that a competitive \"People\'s Google\" (\"Poogle?) becomes conceivable. The idea of a single organization within civil society that can even remotely approach Google\'s phenomenal computing resources is of course absurd. But so in general is the idea of civil society \"taming\" the most powerful and entrenched forces and institutions. The problem here, though chiefly technological, is very similar to the one that civil society faces every day: How can a large number of people sharing similar (though not identical visions) work together voluntarily without central authority (or centralized support), undertake a project and succeed with large, complex undertakings. The \"answer\" though diffuse, incomplete and sub-optimal is for the \"workload\" &mdash; including identifying, discussing and analyzing problems to devising responses to the problems &mdash; to be divvied up &mdash; as \"intelligently\" as possible &mdash; so people, doing only \"pieces\" of the whole job can be successful in their collective enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis strategy is much easier to define and implement in the technological realm. One very successful example of this is the SETI@home project that employs the \"idle\" cycles of user\'s computers all over the world to analyze radio telescope data in a search for extraterrestrial intelligence. If, for example, one million computers working together on the people\'s search project, could devote some amount of processing power and storage to the project, the concept might suddenly become more feasible. \r\n\r\nAlthough it would be possible for every participating computer to run the same software, breaking up the tasks and distributing them across a large number of computers (thus allowing us to \"divide and conquer\") is likely to provide the most suitable architecture for a People\'s Search Engine. For one thing this allows dynamic re-apportioning of tasks: Changing the type of specialization that a computer is doing to make the overall approach more effective. At the beginning of \"Poogle\'s\" life, for example, half of the computers might be devoted to finding (or \"spidering\") and indexing websites while the other half might work on identifying which web sites meet the users\' search criteria and presenting a list of pertinent results to the user. After a week or so, it may become clear that the first task (identifying and indexing sites) may require less attention overall while the second task (handling user search requests) desperately needs more processing power. In this situation, some of the computers working on the first task could be re-assigned to the second task. Of course this situation might become reversed the following week and another adjustment would be necessary. In a similar way, the contents of indexes could be shifted from computer to computer to make more effective use of available disk space more efficiently while providing enough redundancy to ensure that the entire system works efficiently even though individual computers are being shut down or coming online all the time and without advance notice.\r\n\r\nThe People\'s Search Engine (PSE) would make all of its ordering / searching algorithms public. Google\'s page-ranking algorithm is fairly widely known, yet Google has adjusted it over the years to prevent it from being \"gamed\" in various ways by people who hope to increase the visibility of their web pages by \"tricking\" the algorithm to gain a higher page rank than the Google gods would bestow. Ideally the PSE would offer a variety of search approaches of arbitrary complexity to users. Thus people could use an existing, institutionalized classification scheme like the Dewey Decimal System or a personalized, socially-tagged \"folksonomy\" approach, a popularity approach a la Google, a social link approach like Amazon (\"People who searched for X also searched for Y\") or searches based on (and/or constrained by) \"meta-information\" about the pages, such as author, domain, publisher, or date last edited. \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h6>Card catalog photo from Duke University, http://www.lib.duke.edu/libtour/perkins/cardcat.htm</h6>', 'The development of \"open source,\" public domain approaches to information access is essential for equity and progress among the people of the world.

Most governmental and scholarly research examining the digital divide has focused on national-level data and federal policy programs.  In addition, there has been growing interest among researchers in exploring the digital divide as an international phenomenon.  Increasingly, state government agencies within the United States have begun to research digital divide issues with the goal of developing state-level policies to address the social, educational, cultural and economic issues related to this divide. However, few studies have addressed the role of municipal governments in creating opportunities for access, training, and utilization of communication and information technologies. \r\n\r\nThis proposed paper examines the initiatives developed by key U.S. cities that have identified the digital divide as a significant policy issue within the jurisdiction of municipal government.  The paper explores municipal digital divide policy and initiatives through case studies of Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; and Atlanta, Georgia. The research explores how city governments leverage their existing regulatory powers and develop partnerships with traditional organizations such as educational institutions, social service agencies, and economic development offices to offer comprehensive policies promoting digital opportunities within their cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary research has identified four typical steps undertaken by cities concerned with the technological divide affecting their citizens:\r\n\r\n1. Evaluation and Assessment of Digital Divide within the Community.\r\n2. Development of Partnerships with Education, Social Service Agencies, and Industry.\r\n3. Leveraging existing Federal and State Grant Programs.\r\n4. Implementation of Initiatives that are Unique and Responsive to Community.\r\n\r\nFor example, the City of Austin established a Community Technology Initiative and formed a partnership with a broad-based group of schools, non-profit organizations and universities to bridge the local digital divide through a number of projects--including a successful grant proposal to a Texas state agency.  In addition, Austin has instituted its own Grant for Technology Opportunities in order to encourage Austin organizations to develop programs of their own that promote training and public access to computers and the Internet.\r\n\r\nBy exploring the efforts of municipal governments, it is hoped a model may emerge that might benefit other local jurisdictions with their attempts to bridge their own digital divide.  At the same time, the paper suggests that the trend towards rapid deregulation of communication industries has created an unstable regulatory environment that exacerbates the inequity of information technology access and use.  As deregulation continues and communication industry concentration increases, concerns about the digital divide are likely to grow.  Because the current laissez-faire approach to communication policy at the federal level favors the private interests of communication corporations, a void exists for regulatory jurisdictions supporting policy in the public interest.

Three such questions that are only beginning to be addressed include:\r\n\r\n·	How do individuals use the Internet when seeking information for daily situations?  \r\n·	What barriers do they encounter?\r\n·	What are the benefits of CNs?', 'Context:\r\n\r\nPast studies suggest that equitable and easy access to information about local resources can help people deal with the myriad of situations that arise through everyday living such as finding a new job, locating daycare services, dealing with grief or divorce, moving to a new neighborhood, finding where to get your car fixed, etc. (Chatman, 1996, 2000; Chen & Hernon, 1982; Dervin, et al., 1976; Durrance, 1984a; Durrance, 1988; Harris & Dewdney, 1994; Pettigrew, 2000; Savolainen, 1995).  However, these same studies reveal that all people--despite their education, financial status, occupation, or social ties', 'Patterns to Barriers to Using CI Systems \r\n\r\nBarriers, a key concept in the sense-making framework, represent the ways in which people are prevented or blocked from seeking information successfully.  By identifying barriers, one can devise ways of improving the design of digital CI systems that facilitate users information behavior.  Our respondents were asked several open-ended questions that addressed types of barriers.  Specifically, we asked them to explain what, if anything, would make it easier for them to find what theyre looking for, and to describe any past actions they might have taken regarding their search topic.  In spite of respondents confidence in their abilities to get quality information, along the way they encountered a range of barriers to access. \r\n \r\nBarriers, including cultural, financial, geographic, and physical, further challenge users with successfully seeking CI such that they cannot always obtain information about needed services or participate fully in civic life.  While information technologies hold significant promise for linking individuals with information and one another, they are foreshadowed by the potential for a deeper digital divide between the information rich and the information poor.\r\n\r\nHence, our research questions focused on the types of situations that prompt individuals to use (and not use) digital CI systems for everyday help, the specific types of CI that they are seeking, the types of barriers users encounter and how they deal with them, and how they are helped by networked CI.  \r\n\r\n\r\nA major pattern of barriers that we identified was labeled Information-related.  It contained several subcategories:\r\n\r\n·	Poor RetrievalInformation Overload and Low Precision: Due to poor search engines and site indexing, users retrieved too much CI and were challenged with discerning what was relevant to their search;\r\n\r\n·	Poor Interface Design: Users were often daunted by a sites layout (appeared too busy, too many bells and whistles, poor font and color choice, especially for those who are color-blind) and the amount of text displayed on a single screen;\r\n\r\n·	Poorly Organized (Classified): Users did not find CI where they expected to find it, and there was little cross-referencing;\r\n\r\n·	Out-of-date and Inaccurate Information: CI was either out-of-date or there was no way of discerning when a page was created or last updated.  Inaccuracies in content were also noted;\r\n\r\n·	Authority: Without proper identifiers and author credentials or association endorsements, users found it difficult to gauge the quality of the CI source, i.e., whether they should trust the CI (and its source) or not;\r\n \r\n·	Missing: Users sometimes commented that information was missing although it was described as existing at the beginning of a page or document;\r\n\r\n·	Dead Links: Users were frustrated when finding a link to a page or site that they believe would be highly relevant to their information need, only to find that the link was inactive or otherwise unavailable;\r\n\r\n·	Language Used: Beyond most information appearing in English only, some sites contained information written in jargon or at a level too high to understand;\r\n\r\n·	Security: Users want strong evidence that the information they submit and retrieve is confidential (reassured security, as one user phrased it);\r\n\r\n·	Specificity: Users wanted to search for information at the neighborhood level and to find people; \r\n\r\n·	Non-anticipatory Systems: uses indicated that their information behavior would be greatly facilitated if CI systems were smart enough either to anticipate their next information need (based on the need posed to the system by typed query or by point and click) or a related information need.  All too often users described how the site they found was not quite what they were looking for but they did not know where to go to next.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThese information-related barriers are highly significant because they represent specific impediments that users encounter when seeking information.  The pattern, above, is seen as a ladder with use possible only after overcoming the particular set of barriers encountered by an individual.   Job seekers, for example, feel that they cannot get ahead unless they have access to a computer, not only so they can become more computer literate, but also because thats how they perceive people learn about job opportunities these days.  For any one situation or information need, a user might be confronted by several barriers, which, collectively, can overwhelm the user and prevent him or her from locating needed information.\r\n\r\nExamining barriers from the sense-making framework we see a set of barriers that make if difficult to get and use information.  These barriers were labeled: technological (e.g., slow connection speeds and software, unavailable or incompatible systems), economic (e.g., users could not afford computing equipment or online access), geographic (connectivity was unavailable or people lived far away from a public access site), search skills (users did not know how to search the system/Internet or how to use advanced methods), cognitive (users did not understand how the Internet works in terms of indexing and search engines, how links are created, who creates and manages the information, how sites are updated, etc.), and psychological (users expressed a lack of confidence in their own ability to find needed information, i.e., they internalized search failures and believed the reason they could not find something was because they were unable to carry out the search successfully).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThe patterns shown above use the Dervin framework as the base.  Needs are seen on the left and outcomes on the right.  Barriers are depicted in the center of the pattern as (as seen in the Dervin framework) gaps.\r\n\r\nThese barriers point to problems as well as potential solutions for improving the usability and helpfulness of digital CI systems (discussed in Pettigrew & Durance, 2001).  Despite these information-related barriers, some respondents were highly confident that they could find what they needed through the community network.  They tended to perceive their community network as a ubiquitous source and gateway to all knowledge.  In this sense we identified a mismatch between what users think they can obtain via the Internet and the likelihood that that information exists and can be easily located.  This finding expands on a principle of everyday information behavior: that a mismatch exists between what users believe service providers offer and what they actually do (Harris & Dewdney, 1994).', 'Solutions: Toward Patterns of success\r\n\r\nIn spite of the barriers encountered by users of the Internet, Community Networks are valued and used by the adult population, and enable individuals, from near and far, to find information about local services and events, and facilitate different types of information seeking for everyday living.  Although many barriers are associated with digital CI system access, these same barriers suggest optimal solutions that may assist in creating even stronger and more information literate communities.  \r\n\r\nWe found that each community network reflects the mission of its parent organization, and, just as importantly, the knowledge, skills, and values of librarians. The leaders of these best practice community networks are able to assess situations and local conditions. The actual community network model developed results from a variety of community and library circumstances and consisted of a range of content development and service considerations.  Leaders of the three case-study community networks recognize the need to provide training and technical assistance to community organizations and non-profit groups; how they do it varies. They are likely to convene or otherwise bring community organizations together (through public meetings, listservs, etc). They find different ways to show community groups the value of developing relevant content and linking to related organizations. Community network leaders foster communication among community organizations; communication leads to the creation of new partnerships among community groups. The community network is a mechanism for modeling activities that result in increased collaboration, volunteerism, training, and other benefits to the community.\r\n\r\nThe community network users in our study included men and women of all ages.  They sought CI for personal and work-related situations with an emphasis on CI about employment, volunteerism, and social service availability, along with local history and genealogy, local news, computer and technical information, and other people (residing both within and beyond the community).  Users situations were complex and usually required multiple pieces and sources of CI, hence they often tried other sources (friends, newspapers, telephone directories, etc.,) before turning to the network.  In this sense, we learned that the Internet has not replaced the role of social ties in citizens information behavior; instead, it is supplementing their information-seeking.  Users also tended to be highly confident that they could find what they needed through the Internet, which led to our identification of some mismatch between what users think they can obtain and the likelihood that that CI exists and can be easily located.  In addition to facilitating proxy search where users search for CI on behalf of another person (but not always at that persons behest), we found evidence that the Internet has created glocalization (in Wellmans terms) where it is being used for both local and long&#64979;distance interaction.\r\n\r\nWhile most barriers that prevented people from successfully seeking CI were information-related, others pertained to technology and search skill levels, economics, geography, cognitive understanding, and psychological factors.  Despite facing barriers our respondents indicated that they benefited from an increased ability to access CI, and believe the community network helped them access hard-to-get and higher quality information more easily with decreased transaction costs (time and money).  Thus it is clear that community networks provide access to CI that previously had been scattered and difficult to use.  People reported a number of personal benefits including: increased skill and confidence, employment and educational gains, increased knowledge of community, and benefits that accrued to their family, friends, and neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nWe learned that community networks have a multiplier effect.  Not only do they bring benefits directly to individual users, they also benefit community organizations that reach out to specialized segments of the community (such as the disabled, the homeless, the mental health community, those who serve parents or the unemployed).  We also found that community networks built connections among community-serving organizations. Both citizens and non-profit organizations reported that their community network helped them overcome various barriers, including geographical, digital divide, and personal confidentiality concerns.  Non-profit organizations reported that involvement in the community network resulted in an increased effectiveness that, in turn, resulted in an increased ability to be more responsive to their constituency and the community.  \r\n\r\nThe multiplier effect is also seen in the community networks effect on the way organization leaders approach their responsibilities.  We found that a community network can help community organization leaders think like information professionalsespecially librariansand thus take a broader view of the community, learning how to visualize how their organization (and its information) relates to the information and services of other groups.  This results in an increased respect for the knowledge and skills that librarians bring to the community.  Finally we learned that a community network can contribute in various ways to community building by fostering civic engagement through volunteerism and other means, and increase a sense of community among organizations and individuals.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-14 14:33:54', '2002-04-11 20:35:08', NULL, NULL, 'University of Michigan School of Info', NULL, 165, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

They often do not have the communications and education and training resources they need to do their work. Poor people do not have the information they need in order to take control over their lives and get the resources to which they are entitled, or to advocate effectively for themselves.\r\n\r\nLack of access to communication severely limits the opportunities for building communities where poor people can help themselves access the resources they need and where advocates and activists in the anti-poverty community can be involved in organizing for social change locally, nationally and internationally.', 'The players in this online movement include poor people and advocates involved with community advocacy groups, settlement workers, multicultural groups, seniors organizations, disability groups, legal aid, test case interveners, labour organizations, public libraries, women', 'Poverty is a debilitating worldwide problem that affects poor people directly, and society at large. Although access to information and resources is critical to overcoming poverty and alleviating the problems of people living in poverty, poor people and anti-poverty advocates traditionally have less access to the internet and other communications technology.\r\n\r\nAlthough poverty and computers do not make for an obvious alliance, it is clear that the two worlds have to connect unless we want to have a society where access to information and resources is only for people who can afford access to the technology.\r\n\r\nPublic access sites are rarely adequate to feed public need; users need people to help them do online research, and free printers to print out forms and information. Hosts of public access sites need money to keep equipment up-to-date and tech support to keep computers and internet connections running smoothly. Lack of access to communication makes it difficult to connect communities in the anti-poverty world outside their local regions.\r\n\r\nPovNet is a non-profit society created in British Columbia, Canada in 1997. It is an online resource for anti-poverty advocates and poor people, created to assist poor people and advocates involved in the communities identified above through an integration of offline and online technology and resources. \r\n\r\nPovNet works with advocates and activists across Canada involved in direct case work and social action and justice.  Some of these groups include:\r\n\r\n* The National Anti-Poverty Organization (http://www.napo-onap.ca/), a national voice for poor people, working to eliminate poverty in Canada\r\n\r\n* The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (http://www.policyalternatives.ca/), a left-wing think tank doing research for change in social policy\r\n\r\n* Canadian Social Research Links (http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/), an all-inclusive resource for social policy information about poverty in Canada\r\n\r\n* DisAbled Women\'s Network of Ontario (http://dawn.thot.net/), an online inclusive community fostering virtual activism and indivual empowerment locally and globally\r\n\r\n* The Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action (FAFIA) (http://www.fafia-afai.org/home.php), a coalition of over 50 Canadian womens equality-seeking and related organizations organized to further womens equality in Canada through domestic implementation of its international human rights commitments.\r\n\r\n* The Toronto Disaster Relief Committee (TDRC) (http://www.tdrc.net/), a group of social policy, health care and housing experts, academics, business people, community health workers, social workers, AIDS activists, anti-poverty activists, people with homelessness experience, and members of the faith community who provide advocacy on housing and homelessness issues.  and lobby the Canadian government to end homelessness by implementing a fully-funded National Housing Program.\r\n\r\nPovNet has become an online home base for advocates in BC and across Canada. Its web site provides regularly updated information about issues and policy changes.\r\n\r\nUsing PovNet  resources is an interactive process. Advocates learn the tools because they find them useful in order to do the social justice and case work that they care about; poor and otherwise marginalized people find the web site when they need the information on it that is relevant to their lives.\r\n\r\nFor example, PovNet email lists have grown over the years to be an invaluable resource for specific campaigns (for example the Raise the Rates campaigns in both Ontario and British Columbia to raise welfare rates). They also provide an online support network for advocates working in sometimes quite isolated areas in British Columbia or in other parts of Canada.\r\n\r\nAs one advocate put it: \"I love the PovNet list - on the lighter side there\'s the kibitzing going on amongst the subscribers which often brings me to laughter - always a good thing in this job. On the serious side - the exchange of ideas and generous sharing of experience is a huge boon to those of us who often don\'t have time to pick up the phone to seek advice from our colleagues.\"\r\n\r\nAnother subscriber says: \"The lists that I am a subscriber provide me with first hand current information on what issues are affecting BC residents and/or newcomers. I am able to provide useful information and referrals to some of the requests coming through PovNet lists. They are an invaluable and efficient resource for community advocates, settlement and family workers, especially those issues that are time-sensitive and need an immediate response.\"\r\n\r\nOther PovNet tools include a web site which is updated once a month with new information, online education and training courses (PovNet U) for poor people, for example the course: \"Be Your Own Advocate\" and for advocates (\"Introduction to Advocacy\", \"Disability Appeals\" and \"Tenants\' Rights\") and online space for anti-poverty community groups to have their own web spaces, calendars, and discussion boards.\r\n\r\nPovNet is a flexible tool in that it can adapt to needs as specific campaigns emerge. For example, we set up an email list for a new campaign to raise welfare rates, and created an online hub for papers and press releases when a group of anti-poverty activists travelled to tyhe United Nations in Geneva to speak on behalf of poor people in Canada on social and economic rights.\r\n\r\nBuilding a successful online movement in anti-poverty communities include, first and foremost, the people.  Start by finding local community workers who want to broaden their connections, getting together key people (without computers) to talk about what is needed and identify the technological limitations,  communicate with advocates and activists in diverse anti-poverty communities including urban and ural, First Nations, aboriginal, different cultural communities, disability groups, women, youth, seniors, workers, human rights and anti-poverty workers, and international anti-poverty workers.\r\n\r\nThen identify the barriers, which could include  access to the technology (education, money,  literacy, language), how to share information, resources and skills between \"have\" and \"have-not\" advocacy communities (e.g. community advocates and advocates in funded agencies, etc.), researching how to provide online resources in languages other than English and how to provide an online space for poor people to communicate  and access information via public access sites and web based interactive resources.\r\n\r\nBarriers for advocates and activists using PovNet tools have changed over the years. Initially, fear of technology was a big factor. But as advocates saw the use of it as a communications tool, they taught and continue to teach each other. Money for computers and printers is an ongoing problem; as the technology demands higher end equipment, advocates in rural communities with dialup get frustrated with attachments that take up all their dialup time, for example. The anti-poverty work gets harder as governments slash social services; the advocates have fewer resources to do their work. Technology can\'t help that.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the difficulties, the network continues to grow, make links with other organizations both in Canada and internationally, and exchange ideas and strategies for making social change.', 'The most effective online anti-poverty communities are constructed from the bottom up rather than the top down. Their resources are defined and created by advocates and poor people to address the need for online anti-poverty activism as they come up.

The PLWP organization was formed after users found each other in the MGH Neurology bulletin board, eventually becoming a tight-knit group of like-minded patients and caregivers. The organization now consists of highly motivated members around the world dealing with Parkinson\'s Disease, and the group hosts a number of physical-world fundraisers and has a project to collect demographic research data on young onset Parkinson\'s Disease patients. \r\n\r\nA similar example is the Huntington\'s Disease Advocacy Center (www.hdac.org), one of the most highly recommended websites for people looking for information about Huntington\'s Disease. This resource was created by caregivers who met each other in MGH Neurology\'s chatrooms. What started as typical \"weak tie\" relationships between people evolved into the highly productive coordination and creation of a website that is far more helpful and informative than most of the \"professionally\" created medical resources on the Internet. \r\n\r\nA final example is a group of people with seizures who have undertaken their own nationwide illness awareness campaign.

Existing communications industries seek to limit the disruption to their current business practices and investments that Internet Protocol (IP) represents.   Reaction by governments to the disruption of governance structures has recently begun.\r\n\r\nFor people marginalized by such a society, effective capacity to use the Internet becomes a basic need.   Suitable market conditions alone cannot meet that need.  Only community-based experience and control of communications infrastructure based on Internet Protocol can provide underserved groups with the means to use digital technology effectively.', 'Communities need to assert responsibility for control of their online experience.  Thus we examine ways that community online can enhance the power of individuals and groups within communities to use the Internet for development.', 'The power to distribute processes of transaction and interaction will continue to increase, and its cost to decrease.  This growth in process complexity represents a shift in our capacity to understand and apply the role of dynamic networks in the structure of human relations.  We dont yet know its full impact.\r\n\r\nEffective use of distributed processing power depends on leaving the decisions to connect in the hands of a networks members.  Networks self-organize.  The rules governing their shape are self-referential and internal to each participating element.  Individuals as networks are different from communities as networks, but structured by the same rules.  They are ruled by the need to adapt.\r\n\r\nBecause they can learn, networks are dynamically complex, not mechanistic.  We can grasp their principles of self-organization.  We can follow the story of how they were informed and what they then did.  We cannot predict what they will do.\r\n\r\nIdentity is learned.  The network is always there for reasons that emerge from its experience.  It continuously tells us who we are, and that we are still in control of telling our own story.  For a dynamic network to cohere, the narrative (the story it tells and remembers) must be able to adapt to whatever it experiences. It is never designed.  And a network, and also a society that is composed of networks, always learns its way around the imposition of external order.\r\n\r\nBecause of that need to learn, now is the time to reconceptualize the Internet as critical local infrastructure for the governance of connection.  Now is the time for local governments to accept responsibility for ensuring that this particular public good continues to exist. In the 21st century, moving bits is just as fundamental as moving people and cars. But the Internet is different from other critical infrastructure, because the cooperative dimensions of the essential Internet Protocol need to be protected in the public interest. Getting that protection in place begins from within community.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroadband\r\n\r\nWe should base our definition in capacity to change technologies, not in specific technical solutions.  We cannot yet see the upper limits of network capacity to connect.  But, if our network infrastructure can scale in parallel to growths in data transfer rates and the complexity of networked applications, then we have broadband.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Ownership\r\n\r\nBecause control of a network (of the means by which IP affects the place where we live) is inextricably bound up with capacity for socio-economic development, municipalities cannot afford to wait on the whims of external suppliers.  The market will not give us the IP network flexibility we need to keep moving forward.  To ensure an appropriate network infrastructure is created in a manner that protects community needs, we must do it ourselves.\r\n\r\nBroadband lessons learned make it clear that local ownership drives economic development.  Community-based approaches to control of local communications infrastructure stimulate development from the bottom up, increase social well-being, and improve government service delivery among those groups least likely to have profited from digital opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn an online world, our successes depend on cooperative linkages, and on the way our community uses communications technologies to link to outside producers and consumers that are important to us. If we own the last mile, then our chances of making the interactive development choices we face and learning from what results are better than if we dont. \r\n\r\nLocal ownership and governance of open-access broadband backbones as public utilities are based on 4 principles:\r\n\r\n Autonomy of decisions to connect.\r\n\r\n IP is a public good that local governments must sustain.\r\n\r\n Focus on the uses of ICTs for development, not technologies,\r\n\r\n Public ownership of local networks can be structured to foster the growth of local private enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Defense of IPs Role\r\n\r\nThe key change driver in the current communications context is the Internet, and in particular Internet Protocol, not telecommunications.  Much more than changes in processes, products and services, IP is driving fundamental shifts in the way that things get done.  Local ownership of community-based open networks allows for IP to live and breath.  \r\n\r\nIP itself is not an artifact.  Its a set of rules for codes about how various digital communications capacities will work. All it does is move packets of bits across routers acting as reciprocating peers. .  At any one moment, the constituent bits that make up its flow are the result of millions of decisions to connect that occur at its edges.\r\n\r\nIP and its effects are in the public domain. To constrain the full impact of IP is to enclose a common.  It is the role of governments to guarantee that the IP common remains open.\r\n\r\nIn IP, the choice to connect is an individual choice, not corporate. To sustain the self-organization of networks, the Internet enhances the autonomy of the individual to relate to other individuals without reference to authority or to structures that purport to legitimize or \"represent\" their choices.  The growth and evolution of Internet use continues because more people like the autonomy this gives them than do not.\r\n\r\nThe power of IP comes from the capacity it gives us to spin webs of significance through the choices we make about links.  For new meanings, new perceptions to emerge and survive, it is essential that our decisions about connecting remain self-determined.\r\n\r\nIt is self-defeating for businesses to block our capacity to decide what and where to place our live links among each other.  When a market is informed by peer-to-peer relationships then everyone in it is a member.  In a networked economy, every market is a community that informs its decisions.  There are no more customers. To imagine consumers as passive receptacles of products and services is to ignore the interactive roles we all play in networked systems of demand and supply.\r\n\r\nThe self-organizing networks that IP was designed to sustain are networks of people.  We should not talk about governance of the Internet.  We should talk about governance by the Internet. We have to begin telling politicians that the distributed structure of a society that is online and an economy that is networked is a structure of communities.  In such a society, IP becomes a social contract about collaborative relationships in which everyone acts as router and as  Universal Resource Locator. \r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Access\r\n\r\nThe best means to stimulate local socio-economic development through Internet use is by access to an open network utility where the rules of play are the same for everyone. Networks reduce transaction costs.  Open access ensures we are doing enough for local businesses, organizations and individuals to gain that advantage.\r\n\r\nJust because we own the network doesnt mean we have to operate it.  Operations can and should be outsourced. Public  private partnerships are possible, even desirable, in the creation and operation of essential local Internet infrastructure.\r\n\r\nOpen access creates a level playing field by separating: \r\n Construction and ownership of physical network infrastructure\r\n\r\n Network management (by contracting out when local authorities dont need those skills to reach objectives)\r\n\r\n Service providers (lowering the barriers to entry in local markets for Internet service fairly, thus promoting growth and competition, and generating revenue for both network owners and managers)\r\n\r\nIn such a utility, the better the service providers do, the better the network operator does and the better the owner does.  Both the operator and the owner have incentives to encourage innovation and growth in services.  We create a local market for online goods and services where the major benefits stay in our own economy.', 'Local Government Should Act to Control the Infrastructure of the Local Internet Loop\r\n\r\nThe capacity of communities to make development choices is critical to sustaining the open systems of a knowledge society. Local control of the infrastructure of the local Internet loop supports that essential autonomy.  The price of universal access to technologies is not the primary social issue.  Because IP affects relationships, participation in and effective use of networked social structures is the primary social issue.  Until they move to local control, local governments cant begin to make an impact on correcting negative social change as a consequence of living daily life online.  The actions needed to achieve this result include:\r\n\r\n An approach to broadband communications use that can scale up\r\n Local network ownership \r\n Local government commitment to an open IP common.\r\n Design and operation of local networks as open access', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-14 17:26:29', '2006-10-24 11:19:54', 'Telecommunities Canada', NULL, 'Telecommunities Canada', NULL, 173, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Many community networks find it difficult to sustain this level of service provision.', 'Freenets and community networks emerged in Canada in the 1990s with the goals of providing universal access and creating a vibrant online public sphere.  Many made their services available for minimal or no charge to individual users.  They have traditionally provided internet access, training and user support directly to individual end users, many of whom experience multiple barriers to using online tools.  Building sustainable community networks in Canada has proven to be a formidable task.  Many energetic Canadian groups starting in the early 90s have failed to realize their dreams.  A significant proportion of these early groups no longer exist.  The surviving groups often find themselves managing with a heavy reliance on project funding for their activities rather than on sustainable user-based income.', 'Multiple barriers to internet access continue to exist for a significant percentage of the Canadian population.  While the growth of Internet usage over the previous decade has been astronomical, more recently this rapid growth appears to have leveled off.  Young, urban, educated males with plenty of disposable income are well represented amongst regular internet users.   While those in rural areas with lower income and seniors with less formal education are not.\r\n\r\nMulti-barriered individuals typically require levels of personal support and understanding that are difficult to provide on an ongoing basis.   Furthermore, the same individuals are frequently unable to contribute greatly to the ongoing survival of the network.  Meanwhile, more skilled users who can bring greater levels of support to the network tend to advance rapidly and move on to other providers.  This dynamic presents a challenge for community networks. (Neil Guy \'96)\r\n\r\nIn the past few years Vancouver Community Network (VCN) has attempted to meet its vision for universal access and public space partially through working with community groups.  VCN brings its information and communication technology (ICT) focus and blends it with the expertise of community groups who work with disadvantaged populations.  VCN hopes that this approach also counters the individualization of problems and solutions with a more collective approach to problem solving. (http://www.vcn.bc.ca/whats-new/welcome.html#COM). \r\n\r\nThe activities of VCN that have a direct bearing on this partnership with community groups towards its goals fall into three broad categories: connectivity, content development and public access.  \r\n\r\nBefore community groups are able to take advantage of any aspects of using the Internet, it is essential that they are able to access it with regularity and reliability.  Only after achieving a degree of integration of online activities with their everyday office activities are community organizations able to start developing content of relevance to their goals.  Depending on their goals, location and premises they may decide to extend their provision of Internet access to their members and the wider community.  \r\n\r\n1. Connectivity: VCN has offered a basic connectivity package to community groups to help ease their transition into using online tools to help them meet their goals.   The package consists of unlimited 56K dial-up connectivity, subsidized new or refurbished computer, lab-based training for group members, set-up and installation of working terminal and training review at community group location plus ongoing phone, email and walk-in support.  This package has been delivered to 460 groups in the Greater Vancouver area during the past three years and has been supported by the Industry Canada VolNet program (http://www.volnet.org/)\r\n\r\nVCN has collaborated with a local college students union to provide dedicated modem pool access to students who register with the union.  The students union provides the first level of contact for students and handles registrations and many help requests.\r\n\r\n2. Content development:  VCN has collaborated with groups to develop content that is driven by group needs and based on current activities.  VCN is currently working with user groups at four Vancouver public access sites to pilot the application of online tools being used to support asset based community development processes.  The HRDC Office of Learning Technologies is supporting the project. (http://olt-bta.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/CLN/). Two of the Vancouver Community Learning Network areas of focus are: \r\n\r\nSeniors\r\n\r\nVCN has been working with a senior\'s day centre and residential facility in developing on-line access, user support and other equity issues related to the site. How do you build the capacity for volunteer support for senior\'s organizations?  How do you create community content?  How do you extend the information that is produced with those residents who are unable to get access on-line? How can an asset based community development process enhance these activities?  At the Lion\'s Den, information technology has been a catalyst in leading to a monthly newsletter, a weekly lecture series with volunteer professors and a play produced by local high school students based on the seniors oral histories. \r\n \r\nImpact of the Olympics on Community Coalition\r\n\r\nHow can information technology enhance the ability of grassroots community organizations to engage in a public narrative over public spending priorities?  In Vancouver, through the use of community alliance building, the public dialogue over spending priorities related to Vancouver\'s 2010 Olympic bid has included housing, eviction issues, the environment, sustainable transportation, civil liberties issues and extending the economic opportunities to a wider group of people.  Information technology and importance of developing relevant community content has been vital in providing important information to the public when the mainstream media have failed to tell the whole story.\r\n\r\nWestcoast Child Care Resources Centre\r\n\r\nAt another access site, content development for the childcare community is being undertaken.  Services offered by the centre and prioritized as being widely used are being complemented by the use of online tools.  These include a job posting service, extending the reach and readership of an existing newsletter and a collaborative network to support the work of family outreach workers who spend much of their work time on the road.  (http://www.vcn.bc.ca/vcn/innovations/).   \r\n\r\n3. Public access:  From its earliest days VCN has collaborated with community spaces like libraries and day centres to provide public internet access sites.  Most recently VCN is collaborating with 32 not-for-profit agencies in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia to make internet access available to their users, members and clients.  The public access package generally consists of 2 PCs (though iMac/PC sites have been established) connected via a LAN to a recycled 486 PC Router/firewall/printer server (using the Linux router and terminal server projects) and to the internet via a DSL connection. \r\n\r\nVCN is offering \"User support\" training to staff and volunteers of the host sites in addition to regular training opportunities with the goal of building group technical capacity to support the public access.  Industry Canada is supporting the provision of this package for community groups through the Community Access Program. \r\n(http://cap.ic.gc.ca/).  \r\n\r\nVancouver Community Network has established a 10 terminal storefront internet learning lab in partnership with the Humanities 101 Storefront Society in a low income part of the city.  The lab uses a Linux based application server and recycled 486 work stations. \r\n\r\nThere is a well-recognized glut of used 486 and low end Pentiums available for building community based labs.  However, the cost of software licenses and the need to upgrade donated computers to run proprietary operating systems and software products can be prohibitively expensive for non-profit groups.  A second option is to use open source products that are free to use and can be installed on an application server and shared amongst all the workstations.  Since the server is the only significant expense, this solution can be cost effective with installations of as few as 4 workstations but allows for significant savings with larger labs. (Fred Guptill, 2000)', 'A more robust community network can be developed and sustained by working closely with local community groups.

Potentially, a medically based Web community can become a powerful source of collective intelligence about a particular medical condition, with thousands of people gathering research results, articles, and personal observations to share with each other. Such a community also can be a source of comfort, wisdom, and even new friendships and material assistance. However, the nature of the medium also allows for casual, even abusive use of the information space. How can a site be designed and operated for the best possible outcome?', 'The three-year participatory research on which this pattern was based took place in cooperation with Breast Cancer Action Nova Scotia, <http:/bca.ns.ca>.  It is applicable to adult communities dealing with a long-term, serious disease or condition such as cancers, diabetes, organ transplant, multiple sclerosis, or chronic depression.  However, the study results may well also be applicable to other purposes as well, including social activism.', 'To approach this problem, I turned to social capital theory, which analyzes the elements of beneficial social networks. According to the literature, trust is at the heart of a \"virtuous circle\" of activity wherein people voluntarily help each other, receive benefits in return, and again reach out to provide assistance. Although social capital theory was developed by looking at in-person networks in bounded situations, it appears applicable to any context where mutual assistance is being rendered, such as an online medical mutual-help group.\r\n\r\nThrough a three-year participatory study, I analyzed <http://bca.ns.ca>, Breast Cancer Action Nova Scotia\'s interactive site. My data were derived from content analysis, server log data, interviews, and in-person observation in the U.S. and Canada. I chose Breast Cancer Action Nova Scotia\'s website as an exemplary case to study because it is a powerful engine of social capital. BCANS, as it is known among the \"regulars,\" is the world\'s largest and oldest breast cancer discussion site, indeed one of the oldest medical mutual-help sites in existence, dating from 1996 when it was started by a volunteer. The site began a period of fast growth in 1998 and today serves about 400 closely involved \"regulars\", a wider circle of people who drop in now and then, and an unknown number of lurkers, some of them long-term. Not only women but a few men with breast cancer post to this group, as well as husbands, sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, and friends. Although the majority of users are American, with about one-fourth Canadian, the site also hosts visitors from all the other continents, notably a large and active contingent from Australia and New Zealand, numerous Europeans, and participants from Turkey, South Africa, India, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nParticipants give and receive\r\n·	 reassurance and caring.\r\n·	 informal advice to cope with the myriad sub-acute problems that arise.\r\n·	 encouragement to stick with medical treatment regimens.\r\n·	 professional medical information, such as details of new clinical trials.\r\n·	 support for questioning conventional medical wisdom.\r\n·	 material goods such as cards, gifts, and funds.\r\n·	 \r\n\r\nThe site includes tributes to those who have died; a collection of links to specific breast cancer topics; and a glossary of more than 400 breast cancer-related terms.\r\n\r\nSince its launch with a single discussion forum, an interactive calendar for local (Halifax, Nova Scotia) activities, and a mission statement, BCANS has grown into a community that has written books, given conference presentations, appeared on TV and radio, launched a fundraising arm, and formed numerous in-person friendships. There are two sub-forums now, one to accommodate groups planning get-togethers and one to allow for the swapping of recipes, jokes, and so on. A chat room is open 24 hours a day; regular chats scheduled Wednesday evenings, Saturday and Sunday afternoons. A \"prayer chain\" section is available for users to post spiritual messages. There are two ways for participants to post permanent self-introductions (including photos): by filing a profile, which is then automatically linked with each message; and by posting an autobiography in a password-protected section accessible only to others who have filed a \"biog.\" Many personal friendships have been formed and some community members visit the discussions as often as three times a day.\r\n\r\nIt became apparent in this study that specific features of site design and operations helped to move visitors progressively toward a state of greater trust and reciprocity.  These features allowed new visitors to size up the costs/benefits of participation in a risk-free environment; it allowed longer-term users to stage their level of self-disclosure; choose from many ways to contribute and receive from the group; and take part in various shared experiences, both virtual and face-to-face; and it gave the more established community members chances to develop personal relationships and initiate projects of mutual benefit..', 'This study concludes that BCANS built trust in three stages.  (Note: I am referring to this process in the past tense based on my study data, but nothing appears to have changed at the date of this submission, so the narrative could just as well be in the present tense.) \r\n\r\n1. In most cases, new visitors were attracted and reassured by visual messages saying this was a site built for them. Users cited the absence of advertising, clearly shown  sponsorship by breast cancer survivors, and the opportunity to read caring messages from others with breast cancer as signs that they were in a special, trustworthy place -- a sanctuary.\r\n\r\n2. Self-disclosure, a key step in building mutual trust, was promoted by giving users an opportunity to  choose when and how to give out personal information. In the password-protected \"biog\" section, they could tell their cancer story and pour out their hearts. In a public \"profile\" they could give a quick sketch of themselves if desired. Chats allow a more ephemeral form of \"conversation\" while pop-out email forms permit people to send personal responses to posted comments, instead of posting to the whole forum. Notable in this self-disclosure stage are disclosures about poor medical treatment, alternative and complementary treatments, environmental carcinogens, and other issues that go against mainstream thinking but are received supportively in this community.\r\n\r\n3. Building \"thick trust,\" according to interpersonal relationship theory, usually depends on doing things together, giving people the opportunity to size up the other in a variety of situations.  Most notably, this is accomplished by the webmistress\'s commitment to responding to user needs by building new site features such as the chat room. Sometimes the participants themselves use the site for virtual shared experiences such as written descriptions of \"bus rides\" to visit sick members anywhere in the world and bring them wondrous imaginary gifts. The get-togethers section helps promote face-to-face meetings anywhere in the world, and these are sometimes attended by the webmistress herself.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-14 17:53:18', '2006-01-06 08:18:16', NULL, NULL, 'California State University-Hayward', NULL, 175, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

In the era of the infosphere, the public and private spheres become amalgamated, which results in public exploitation of private lives, increasing invasion of privacy, and continual diminishment of unmonitored privacy.', 'The theoretical discussion of the concept of the public sphere', '<b>Discussion</b>\r\n<u>1. Public/Private</u>\r\nThe notion of the public sphere has been a fruitful analytical category for understanding formations and transformations of public discourse, and for analyzing the modern distinction between public and private from a historical and systematic point of view. Historically seen, the public sphere emerged from a new social, economic, and communicative constellation, the <i>bürgerliche Gesellschaft</i> (bourgeois society). The public sphere must be understood as constitutive corollary of the private sphere. The interaction of these two spheres was a necessary condition for and at the same time birth place of the modern individual. Following Habermas\' sociological and theoretical concept of the structural transformation of the public sphere, one can conclude that the distinction between private and public worked as the basic <i>grammatical rule</i> of early bourgeois society. \r\n\r\n<u>2. Revitalization of Public Discourse</u>\r\nAs analyzed by Habermas, the structural transformation of the public sphere from the early Enlightenment to the late capitalist welfare state led to a \"refeudalization\" and \"ossification\" of the public sphere, dominated by a short circuit of privileged communication between the commercially driven mass media and an elitist political system. This view referred to the period of the German <i>Wirtschaftswunder</i> in the early 1960s, during which economic success was accompanied by a paralysis of public discourse. In his later writings, particularly since the \"Theory of Communicative Action,\" Habermas replaced this pessimistic perspective with a more hopeful model, in which grassroots initiatives and citizens\' movements can influence and instigate public discourse. Thus, the idea of a revitalization of the public sphere could be built upon actual societal agents and existing social movements. Though this view is both more optimistic and more accurate, it does not sufficiently take into account the pitfalls of the information society.\r\n\r\n<u>3. Invasion of Privacy and the Infosphere</u>\r\nPublic discourse is the necessary condition and at the same time unreachable ideal of modern democracy. Yet, it has become a scarce good in the information society and the era of digitized mass communication. At the same time, governmental and commercially motivated surveillance, and the pressure of public opinion cut deeply into people\'s private lives. Privacy is not, however, just a citizen\'s right, it is a need and necessity for civilized life and the development of subjectivity. The normative power of the public eye and the controlling power of discourse formations should be reviewed under the conditions of digital invasions of privacy in global communication networks and databases. Thus, we are witnessing the dawn of a <i>tightly woven global infosphere</i>, a digitized networked panoptic sphere that leaves little space for unmonitored privacy.\r\n\r\n<u>4. The New Sphere of an Amalgamated Public Privacy</u>\r\nAs privacy is increasingly turning into a public and/or commercial good, the distinction public/private is being replaced by an amalgamated public privacy. \r\nThis <i>new sphere of public privacy</i> is characterized by \r\n<ul><li>a culture of public confession and public display and exploitation of the most intimate details of private lives;</li>\r\n<li>a culture of public moralization and condemnation of private lifestyles by self-appointed moral majorities, value committees, and sentinels of politically correctness;</li>\r\n<li>a digitized network of social control, based on vast amounts of personal data, collected, exchanged, and interconnected by commercial, health, governmental, and other agencies.</li></ul> The political reactions to the events of September 11, 2001, have shown that the surveillance function of the infosphere can be triggered when necessary, and basic rights and liberties of citizens are subordinated to the greater good of global surveillance. As much as the public sphere was a corollary of the private sphere in the early modern era, the sphere of amalgamated Public Privacy is the inescapable accompaniment of the infosphere.', 'Due to time restrictions, I cannot address the all the complexities of the sphere of public privacy (see reference 1). In my presentation, I plan to focus on two examples of resistance strategies on the macro- and the micro-level:\r\n\r\n<u>1. The Macro-Level: Revitalization of Public Discourse and the Infosphere</u> \r\nIn contrast to conventional mass media, the Internet permits true nonhierachical, multidirectional communication. In addition, it has a low access and publication threshold; anyone who has the necessary equipment and skills can publish in the WWW or take part in its discussions. As a hybrid medium, the Internet is thus an ideal medium for the interactive forms and needs of communication in the lifeworld. However, it must be emphasized that it is only the social and political actions of human beings, and not the technical structure, that can lead to a revitalization of public discourse in the infosphere. \r\n\r\nThis revitalization is to be found on three main levels of public communication:\r\n (1) <i>Virtual episodic public encounters</i>, such as those that take place in everyday life on the street or in bars, are to be found especially in chat rooms and other loose virtual communities where persons enjoy the protection of \"intimate anonymity.\" (2) <i>Internet-based forms of public assembly</i> can be observed primarily in discussion forums, newsgroups, and mailing lists that are focused on a particular group or topic. (3) Even <i>mass-media based public communication</i> is undergoing a transformation due to the Internet. The conventional media have come under pressure to react constantly to the Internet because of its new role in processes of agenda setting. At the same time, mass media participate in the Internet with their own content and thus constitute a new form of mass communication. This trend is visible in the Internet presence of nearly all print and broadcast media, as well as in the mediamix and cross-media productions of established media conglomerates. \r\n\r\n\r\n<u>2. The Micro-Level: Regulating Invasion of Privacy</u>\r\nCurrently, invasion of privacy is usually understood as a problem of the individual whose privacy has been infringed upon. When it comes to collecting and disseminating data, users are at best asked to opt out, often without a clear description of what the government or commercial bodies will do with the data and, even more importantly, what third parties might be able to do with them. Long documents, usually written in fine print that hardly anybody will read online or offline, are the widespread basis for opt-out opportunities. Moreover, most of these opt-out choices are also presented as possibly disadvantageous to the user. This allows data collecting bodies to accumulate, exchange, and connect immense amounts of personal data without any supervision and usually without the individual\'s knowledge as well.\r\n\r\nInstead of offering a mere opt-out choice, all data collecting bodies should be obliged to offer an opt-in choice as their default setting. At the same time, they must make sufficiently clear to users what they agree to when they opt in. Adopting the <i>criterion of informed consent</i>, I argue that it is not enough to provide a lot of fine print and vague descriptions. Instead, the intended and possible uses by the collecting body and third parties must be clearly and comprehensibly specified, and possible side effects must be addressed, too. This approach might appear as cumbersome at first sight. Yet, it would only reinstate the users\' right to self determination and control over their personal information. The success of this approach depends, of course, on the pressure that public discourse can exert on the agenda of the mass media and on the political system.\r\n\r\n</b>\r\n<u>Note about the images:</u>\r\nImage 1: The conventional model of <i>panoptic surveillance</i>, illustrated with a picture of the floor plan of Pittsburg penitentiary. \r\nImage 2: The <i>digitized networked panoptic infosphere</i> is potentially decentralized, yet in actuality centered around the most powerful computer networks and databases, and on those groups that control access to and flow of networked information in the infosphere.

What can be done to maximize a new communication medium\'s prospects for success?', 'This observation appears to apply to all known communication media, including network computer media.', 'A medium of communication can be usefully defined as being any system that enables the flow of messages between one or more creators of messages and one or more receivers of messages.  The range of media therefore includes such simple systems as face-to-face communication, in which human modalities, light, and air provide all that is physically necessary to enable communication and such complex media as television, in which a broad range of intermediate elements (e.g. mediators) are used as a system to route messages from a small number of message creators to a large number of message consumers.\r\n\r\nCommunication theory is not always focused on media.  Theories of communication also focus on such issues as language (linguistics, grammer, nonverbal), communicators (meaning, information processing, perception, relationships, disclosure, attraction, and conflict), and messages (presentation, information, and persuasion).\r\n\r\nCommunication theory has looked at media from a variety of perspectives.  Systems theories, for instance, generally examine the constituent elements of media.  Reules theories examine the constraints that we impose on ourselves when we use  media.  Diffusion theories look at how messages and new innovations, including media innovations, disperse through socieity.  Mass media theories largely focus on the effects of media.  Reinforcement, agenda-setting, functional, uses and gratifications, and dependency theories are all oriented on the effects of media. \r\n\r\nNo current theory attempts to describe how communication media are invented or how they subsequently evolve.\r\n\r\nNew communication media appear to be invented in five interrelated \"spheres\" of invention.  These spheres of invention include:\r\n\r\n    *  Mediators\r\n    * Characteristics\r\n    * Uses\r\n    * Effects\r\n    * Practices\r\n\r\nMediators are the fundamental building blocks of media, and include such things (using the telephone as an example) as telephones, telephone wires, telephone switches, operators, and billing systems. All media entail mediators. Even face=to-face communication depends on human modalities and the natural resources (air and light) that allow them to function. Mediators can be put together in a variety of ways such that, in combination, they enable a set of Characteristics.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics are the essential capabilities and generic attributes of a medium. A given medium will allow a message to be constructed in a particular number of modalities, travel across certain units of space and time, and to reach an audience of a given size. It is possible to characterize a medium in terms of hundreds of generic characteristics, and to compare media based on those characteristics. Various combinations of characteristics enable a set of Uses.\r\n\r\nUses are the things people use media to accomplish. There are a variety of such uses that have been identified within specific research traditions, including the uses and gratifications approach.  It is not possible to successfully use a medium, however, without some effects.\r\n\r\nEffects are the thngs that happen as a result of using a medium. Effects can be very positive such that they encourage increased use of the medium. They can also be very negative such that they provoke a backlash against a medium. Most successful media experience some measure of both. It should be noted, here, that effects aren\'t simply something that happens. They are, in a very real sense, inventions of the people who decide that a particular effect or set of effects is real and worthy of attention. Indeed, there are specific rhetorics of media effect that, when observed, allow one to conclude that a particular effect of media is real. Several of these rhetorics are enacted, or at least exposed, through media practices.\r\n\r\nPractices are things people do to help maximize or minimize the effects of media. People will seek to maximize what they perceive to be the good effects of media by behaving in ways that maximize a medium\'s potential for a particular effect. They will also seek to minimize what is perceived to be the negative effects of media by constraining particular behaviors within media. Indeed, in some cases, the actions taken to constrain or enhance behavior will be so substnantial as to require a fundamental change to the medium through the introduction of new Mediators.', 'The invention of any medium of communication will entail activity in all of these spheres.  The evolution of media to resolve specific problems can occur in one or more spheres, with results that will often be observable in other spheres.\r\n\r\nNew media will be physically constructed in the sphere of mediators, with people and technology arrainged to obtain a specific set of characteristics.  The process of selecting mediators may not (and probably will not) be thought of in those terms, but the effect of creating a particular arraingement of mediators that enable a flow of messages is to create a proto-medium with a specific set of characteristics.  \r\n\r\nThose characteristics will, to a large extent, determine a mediums potential for success, as it is a mediums characteristics that determine the kinds of things it can be used for.  Media whose characteristics are highly similar to existing successful media are unlikely to succeed, while media with distinctive and useful characteristics are more likely to find a wide usership.  \r\n\r\nThe more distinctive those characteristics are, the more uses a new medium is likely to have, and the more successful it is likely to be, and the more effects it is likely to have.  \r\n\r\nThose effects will, depending on the perspective of those effected, be both positive and negative.  Indeed, effects that might be regarded as some (advertisers, for instance) to be good may be perceived as bad by others.  \r\n\r\nBoth  positive and negative effects, once identified, become the basis for practices.  Strategic practices generally attempt to optimize what are perceived as the positive effects of media by repeating successful usage strategies.  Rules generally attempt to constrain what are perceived to be the negative effects of media by limiting the behavior that is perceived as causing the negative effects.\r\n\r\nMediators, characteristics, uses, effects and practices interrelate in specific ways.  \r\n\r\nIn the cycle of media (mediators to characteristics to uses to effects to practices to mediators), broad characteristics of media can be created, optimized, and changed.  \r\n\r\nIn the cycle of genre (uses to effects to practices to uses), the specific uses of a medium can be modified within a comparatively more stable medium.  \r\n\r\nAll of the spheres of invention in media are subject to negotiation, both within individual spheres and through the interaction of the spheres in the cycles of media and genre.  Hence media are dynamic entities that can be evolved by their users to solve specific problems.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-14 21:27:25', '2006-08-05 20:02:46', NULL, NULL, 'Oswego State University', NULL, 122, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

This expansion of police powers has diminished the space for political rights and created new challenges for human rights advocates.', 'This pattern can be employed in the cyber community of human rights and prisoners', 'Cees J. Hamelink, Professor of International Communication at the University of Amsterdam, writes that human rights provide a \"universally available set of standards for the dignity and integrity of all human beings\"(1994). These standards offer a common frameworkmuch like software standardsin which human rights, including the right to communicate, can be established, protected, and enforced. Communication as a human rightdistinct from freedom of expressionhas been developing in international policy and legal contexts for the last 150 years and is the right most applicable to universal access. Communication in this context is defined as a democratic and balanced dialogue between two or more parties.\r\n\r\nFollowing September 11, 2001, there has been erosion of civil liberties and human rights for detainees and prisoners in the United States. These include rights articulated in the U.S. constitution and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (UN 1993). Main stream media and the public officials who serve as its commentators have not provided an effective space for a proper discussion of these issues.  This pattern attempts to address the means by which information technologies can be used to expand the public space where critical attention can be brought to human and civil rights violations against detainees and prisoners.\r\n\r\nHistorically, U.S. citizens and residents arraigned or sentenced for criminal convictions, as well as illegal immigrants confined in Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) detention centers, have been routinely deprived of certain civil rights and human rights, as defined under U.S. law and international treaties to which the United States is a signatory (Amnesty International 1999; Burton-Rose et al. 1998; James 1996). Key among the rights that have been rescinded are provisions meant to protect an individuals basic needs, such as the right to communicate. Prisoners in the United States, for example, have no uniform guarantees to the right to communicate with family, peers, political, social and legal groups, and the media. Communication rights in the context of incarceration are critical because they are both the sole means for society to receive and impart information regarding the well-being of prisoners and detainees and for informing the public about the conditions of an often forgotten sector of state and societythe American penal system. \r\n\r\nAdvocates and activists for prisoners rights have made efforts to use information technology to inform others, but they have not been prepared, in various ways, to fully utilize their technological resources and human rights frameworks to educate the public and respond to these recent rapid, sweeping changes in U.S. law. \r\n\r\nThe discussion of this pattern will focus on how information technologies can be used to improve the publics awareness of prisoners and detainees access to communication and responses to the curtailment of civil liberties.', 'The solution entails synthesizing a communications network using existing Internet technologies to enable advocates/activists to respond to violations of detainee and prisoner rights.

The Segway Human Transporter (\"IT\") is proposed as a revolutionary mode of intermediate distance transportation that spans a gap between short distance modes of transport (walking, running, etc) and long distance modes of transport (automobiles, buses, ships, trains, and airplanes).  What effects might it have on the ways in which we communicate?', 'The movement of people and message over intermediate distances.', 'The recently announced Segway Human Transporter (\"IT\", according to early press reports) has the appearance of a pogo stick on wheels.  Its appearance suggests a toy, but its design appears to enable very low cost transportation of people, messages, and goods across intermediate distances.  Operation of the Segway has been described as \"magic\" (e.g. \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" Arthur C. Clarke).  As one watches users making use of the Segway for the first time, this description seems apt.  Indeed, the very idea of standing and moving around on what appears to be an unstable platform (a chariot on two parallel wheels without the stablilizing third leg of the horse) is disorienting, and the initial jerkiness of users moving on a Segway for the first time reveals this distrust.  The platform is claimed to be self-stabilizing, however, and the ability of new users to move around smoothly within a minute and to do tricks very quickly thereafter (e.g. Sting on Leno\'s Tonight Show) suggests that the \"magic\" works.  Indeed, it appears to be the first of what may be a new class of \"Do what I mean\" technologies that actively interpret what users want to do based on small variations of position and balance.  The Segway and similar future devices may well turn out to be a very different way of transporting people over intermediate distances.\r\n\r\nToday\'s predominant intermediate distance transportation systems are bicycles, scooters, taxi cabs, panel trucks, and buses.  The bicycle is primarily an intermediate distance transportation system, and is widely used for intermediate distance transportation around the world.  Buses, panel trucks, and taxi cabs are applications of long distance transportation to intermediate distance applications, and while they can generally go anywhere a bicycle can go, they are large, expensive, and generally fuel inefficient in intermediate distance applications.  In its basic configuration, scooters are purely intermediate distance transports.  In more powerful configurations (e.g. motorcycles), they are effective long distance transportation.  In either configuration they are relatively expensive and fuel inefficient when used in intermediate distance applications.\r\n\r\nIntermediate distance transportation systems have proven important to a variety of niche communication media.  The most important of these are correspondence messenger services, mail systems, package delivery systems, merchandise distribution and delivery systems, and the transportation of people to messages and/or audiences (e.g. workplaces, schools, restaurants, theatres, museums, etc.). \r\n\r\nIn its current design the Segway appears to be fairly directly competitive with the bicycle.  It has at least some of the faults of a bicycle (lack of foul weather protection, a single user design, and sweat powered, for instance).  It also has many of the positive aspects (small size, manuverability, and relative efficiency) of a bicycle.  Indeed, the Segway is smaller and appears to be more manuverable than a bicycle, but is fuel efficient without requiring the breaking of a \"sweat\".  It also appears to be safer than a bicycle, as it appears to be engineered to make it hard to fall.  Its biggest fault, as initially announced, is its relatively high cost when compared to a bicycle (currently estimated at about $3000 in consumer models at the end of 2002).  This fault may be fleeting, however.  If successful, there is reason to believe that the price could be driven down to a more competitive price of as little as $600 in large scale mass production. \r\n\r\nThis lower price point is significant, as it is low enough to make Segway\'s affordable in the resource and infrastructure poor countries on the \"have not\" side of the digital divide, countries where bicycles are far more predominant than long distance transports like cars, buses, trains, etc.  Hence there is a significant possibility that the Segway  could be an important enabling technology for increasing the per capita wealth of the over 100 countries that have per capita GNP\'s of $4000 or less, but which contain over 5/6 of the world\'s population.\r\n\r\nOther features of the Segway suggest that the device could have particular value as a practical small factor tranportation device for people with impaired mobility, including people who use walkers, canes, or crutches.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the prospects of the Segway for either enabling new communication media or enabling the evolution of existing media?  What kinds of media might the Segway effect and how?', 'Medium as Process, a theory of media invention and evolution, proposes a framework for examining the possibilities that new mediator technology like the Segway may offer for the invention of new communication media and the evolution of existing media.  This framework involves five spheres of invention in which new media are created.  New technologies like the Segway operate in one sphere of invention, mediators, but have effects in all of the other spheres.  Activity in those other spheres will often dictate the success of new technologies.  Medium as process also proposes a characteristic based typology of media (see descriptive image) which is suggestive of the kinds of media that a device like the Segway might enable and the specific media which it might have a direct evolutionary effect on.  The primary application of this perspective, thus far, has been to electronic media, where the perspective has had some success in projecting new digital media.  It is believed, however, that the perspective can be applied to the assessment of the implications of any new mediator technology, including intermediate distance transportation technologies like the Segway.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-14 23:06:58', '2002-01-28 08:39:17', NULL, NULL, 'Oswego State University', NULL, 122, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Putting people in close connection with one another can be a recipe for intimacy, but can also set the stage for violent disagreement.  Witness the fate of those subjected to domestic violence.', 'In 1949 Clad Shannon and Warren Weaver published their mathematical theory of communication.  This theory, and subsequent work, has made it possible to understand information and communication technologies (ICTs) as technologies that transmit bits over fixed capacity channels.  But isn\'t there a difference between transmission and communication?  Transmission is successful between two people if the receiver can recreate -- perhaps repeat -- the sender\'s message.  In contrast, communication is successful between two people if some form of shared understanding is achieved.  Thus, the email message in a my inbox written in a language unknown to me constitutes a successful transmission, but an unsuccessful communication.  So -- obviously -- yes, there is a difference between transmission and communication.  This difference between transmission and communication explains why -- even as ICTs become more numerous in number and kind -- communication seems to be on the wane.  In short, communication technologies -- as they are currently designed -- do not help us communicate with one another.\r\n\r\nEven though we can exchange bits with one another via the Internet, we do not necessarily communicate with one another.  The ubiquity of online \"flame wars\" in public discussion forums illustrates the truth of this.  In fact, it may very well be the case that the main result of providing universal access to the Internet would be to make it certain that groups fundamentally at odds with one another would butt heads frequently.  In the words of the philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard, online exchanges may very well illustrate a differend, a \r\ndifference so vast between participants that it can never be bridged (Lyotard, 1988).\r\n\r\nIf it is the case, as the Oxford English Dictionary tells us it is, that dialectic was, \"originally, the art of reasoning or disputation by question and answer... [and] the regular name of what is now called logic,\" then I propose that, in the future, ICTs be designed to facilitate dialectics rather than, as they often do now, simply function to transmit the bits of virtual shouting matches or ad campaigns.  The question then becomes the following: How can technologies be designed to facilitate the calm and caring exchange of questions and answers that result in mutual understanding?  In other words, can ICTs be transformed into TADs, techne for artificial dialectics?', 'Recent developments in computational, corpus-based linguistics (e.g., Grefenstette, 1994) make it possible for rough-draft thesauri to be automatically compiled from large collections of texts; e.g., from archives of emails exchanged in online discussions.  These algorithms of computational linguistics work in a strictly mechanical manner: they sum and then average together the language of the texts analyzed and, therefore, also average together the words of conflicting authors if the collection analyzed is a collection of messages from a vicious, online exchange.  Prototype systems that employ such algorithms to graphically summarize online discussions exist.  The Conversation Map (Sack, 2001) is an example of such a system.  The descriptive image submitted with this pattern is an example output from the Conversation Map system.  It was generated from several hundred email messages exchanged in a heated argument on the Usenet newsgroup soc.culture.palestine.  Connected terms in the output diagram are possible synonyms (based on their uses in the texts of the messages).   Thus, the machine-generated summarization of the email texts exchanged resulted in a proposal that, for example, \"israelis\" and  \"palestinians\" are comparable terms; and, also, that \"jews\" and \"arabs\" are possible synonyms.\r\n\r\nIn summary, these algorithms of computational linguistics are doggedly dialectical.  Because of the way they are built, they cannot not find a common ground, a synthesis of the language input.  Consequently, even for an argument so vicious or incoherent that a skilled, human negotiator might find no place to start building common ground, these algorithms will construct -- through mechanical operations -- a potential synthesis.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, it is proposed that we begin to design ICTs that facilitate communication by constructing machinery that can identify possible summaries or syntheses of conflicting -- even violently opposed -- messages.  While the machine-generated syntheses of today may be unrealistic or naive one can imagine a future generation of ICTs that propose compelling and plausible syntheses that could be used by participants as goals for conversation, as common ground that might be achieved through hard work and sincere discussion.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-14 23:19:42', '2002-01-28 07:08:59', NULL, NULL, 'UC Berkeley, SIMS', NULL, 171, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Some might still only see the Web and Internet as a means of connecting to an information /ideas  \'superstore\' (an addition -though rather less proper - to the library or bookshop), but of course the academic Web Homepage offers a way of being out there presenting who we are and what we are, as well as our work. Limited though hypertext is, links to, for example, personal pages or other areas of interest can reveal enough for us to know something of the person and how passions and objections and ideas owned or disavowed, might be better understood. Even with restrictions from an imposed institutional style, the academic Web homepage brings the presence of the person as well as their ideas for inspection, inspiration, the sharing of knowledge and critical review. \r\nIn this pattern we would like to generate greater awareness that the importance of the Web and Internet to academia lies not just in exchanges of ideas but that when presentation of self (eg as a certain sort of thinker, researcher, person and in a particular context) and the work coincide, we can make connections between ideas to the doing of things. We are reminded that our work is part of life and our lives are not abstractions and separate from it   and also there is real possibility it might become part of someone elses mission to create a better world. \r\nWhen we discover the possibility of common academic interest with people from different backgrounds, or with different political or philosophical objectives then we might find common ground for cultural or interdisciplinary work.\r\nWe think one of the most important aspects to study further is how both men and women, the young (and not so young but hopeful) are developing the use of Web and Internet to create academic lives that resist / bypass institutional cultures that only encourages the pursuit of research that fulfils our institutions needs to enhance scholastic credibility in order to compete for financial resources. The web also offers many opportunities for us to share and spread ideas and develop solutions to problems without the patronage, limitations and control of mainstream print media. So we would want to address the many uncomfortable tensions found in some traditional academic hierarchies where control is threatened by the openness and possibilities of the Web (Hess 2001). Participation in presentation on Web offers the possibility for academics to build a career or a reputation based on commitment to positive accountable democratic and life affirming inclusive research and to contribute directly into the wider/global academy.', 'What we would like to see occur from this pattern is to find the ways that Interdisciplinary and fuzzy edged work could be developed through the use of the Web and Internet. We also particularly think theres room in cyberspace to develop ideas and connections in the interstices between disciplines and the establishment of new disciplinary ones. \r\nWe would like to consider how those currently at the beginnings, fringes or those immersed but lost in academic life, could build upon cyber opportunities to confer about and develop ideas that would not otherwise get heard or acted upon. Even within an institution a web presence and the development of interactive skills could contribute to positive change in the cultural life of academy. The development of social thinking and the ability to critically reflect on the nature of our professional praxis would come about from better connections with others in the same situation. \r\nWed like to find ways of advocating the Web and Internet within institutions that would allay any threats they perceive to the undermining of their authority and encourage them to see how active participation in the work and culture would enhance the quality of the work of the academy and maintain standards of scholarship not diminish them. A cultural shift towards improving the acceptability and status of Web based publishing would break some of the difficulties with finding acceptance of publishing inter-disciplinary, interstitial work. \r\nOne solution to the limitations of the virtual presence (for finding others and being found) would be to promote better use of the Web\'s technological wizardry (hypertext possibilities) to enhance the quality of Web self-presentations and reveal the complexities of our work.\r\nIf people find that their work does not coincide with local current ambitions academics the web would help them to explore a revised position for themselves and their work. Furthermore developing a Web presence offers a solution those who lack academic opportunities and the chance of establishing an academic presence because they can\'t get to conferences, or libraries, or who aren\'t linked to acceptable institutions. So people for whom their country of origin or their own immediate or local resources are unable to support their financial or academic needs a solution would be to foster a campaign for better access to Web and Internet facilities. \r\nA wider acceptance of the Web as source for expertise would give confidence to those who may have access to an expert who might be guiding but restricting. The wider view would also enable those people developing independent /distance/lifelong learning skills to tap into the psychological, social and ethical benefits of shared endeavour and the sense of belonging to a wide academic community.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-16 07:45:23', '2006-08-05 20:01:27', NULL, NULL, 'Nottingham Trent University UK', NULL, 177, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

A handful of western-based trans-national media corporations, working in tandem with regional companies, control most programming, emphasising entertainment to recruit urban consumers, and circulating news primarily framed by the interests of corporate business and western foreign policy. Public programming to encourage dialogue and debate of public issues has withered.  Stark inequalities are increasing, in both poor and rich countries, between those with the full means to produce communications and those without, especially if we factor in the violence of poverty, illiteracy, and patriarchal, racial, and caste oppression.', 'A global network of communications activists, advocates and researchers is emerging to address these problems. This network of networks operates simultaneously on at least three planes, the <I>construction of alternative communications media, the reform of the mainstream corporate and state media,</I> and the support of <I>trans-national communications networks for social change movements. Alternative media</I> projects (zines, radio, video, television and internet sites and blogs) not only serve people seldom represented in the corporate media; they also demonstrate what democratic media might look like in their alternative content, modes of operation and overall philosophy.  Communication reformers campaign to make existing local, national and global communications systems more accessible, representative, accountable and participatory. \r\n\r\nFinally, media activists work in support of social change movements whose <I>transnational communications networks</I> also provide additional links for the movements to democratize media. \r\n\r\nWhy now? This is due to at least three inter-related global trends. First, the global shift to neo-liberalism presents people all over the world with a complicated, but very clear set of common problems. Secondly, the communications networks first emerged as links among social justice movements to address these common problems. Finally, the network of communications networks began to take its own shape, as groups everywhere inventively adapted the glut of consumer hardware and software from the transnational corporate market.', '<b>A New World Information Communications Order (NWICO)</b>\r\nThe trans-national movement to transform communications predates the shift to global neo-liberalism. During the 1970s, led by the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a coalition of national governments of the global south, mobilized to challenge the old imperial status quo in which news, information and entertainment media were controlled by western governments and corporate powers. They called within the UN System for a New World Information and Communications Order (NWICO), for an end to the dominance of the western colonial powers, the equitable distribution of the worlds information resources, the <I>right to communicate,</I> and the support of alternative and community based media in democratizing communications. Rejecting this multilateral consensus, the US and UK Governments withdrew from the Commission, arguing with the commercial media industry that any measures to limit western media corporations or journalists represented state censorship of the free flow of information. \r\n\r\nThe US instead shifted to what we now call neo-liberalism, or the Washington agenda.  They called for market rules (privatization of public resources and deregulation of government oversight of corporations) at home and abroad. The Reagan Government successfully gutted anti-trust and public interest rules, as well as public support programs at home, and pushed for the implementation of similar policies in other countries through their powerful voice in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank (WB).  However, the US Government was still unable to win in the multilateral arena, failing to get culture (AV services) onto the trade block in the General Agreement on Trades and Tariffs (GATT), the precursor to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Instead, they decided to work on the less powerful countries one or two at a time, and began unilateral free trade talks with Taiwan, Canada and Mexico. \r\n\r\nDuring the same decade, the number and sophistication of alternative media projects and networks grew around the world. These networks emerged both from the confluence of links between social movements, primarily from the countries of the south, mobilizing against the Washington agenda; and alternative media groups inventively seizing the newly available consumer production media. Primarily based in local geographic communities, media activists began to link across their own countries, national and regional boundaries to share resources, and campaign for greater access to radio, cable and satellite, and the newly emerging computer-linked systems. They also began to support one another on common issues, including the massive cuts in public spending and state-run services, the growth in global media conglomeration, and the US, Japanese and European calls for global standards in digital systems and copyright rules.\r\n\r\nThe trans-national networks begun in this era include the World Association of Community Radio (AMARC) <amarc.org>, and the Association of Progressive Communicators (APC <apc.org>). AMARC now operates via regional organizations, programme sharing through special theme-connected collaborations (against, for example, discrimination against women, and racism) and global media reform coalitions. Formed to support the global network of women, labour, ecologists, indigenous peoples, and of activists organizing against free trade and corporate globalization, APC continues to build on the idea of communication rights, prioritizing the capacity building of women, rural and poor people, and the media reform efforts of member groups.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1990s, a new set of activists demonstrated the more tactical use of the technologies and networks in political change. In 1989, the pro-democracy activists of Tienanmen Square in Beijing China used fax machines to get their message out to the world . In 1994, the Zapatista National Liberation Army built on what Harry Cleaver called the emerging trans-national electronic fabric of struggle,  employing old and new media, and global media networks, to challenge the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Then, in 1997, the Korean labor and social movement activists use highly sophisticated broadband media to demonstrate against the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and also opened Jinbonet, the first Web-based interactive peoples news service. This alternative vision of communications took another leap forward in 1999 when the first Independent Media Center (IMC) formed in Seattle to support the protests against the World Trade Organization (WTO). Drawing from the Zapatistas, the IMCistas created a global news network. Building on the existing networks opposed to corporate globalization, and providing easy-to-use open-publishing software, the global IMC quickly grew to over 150 centers around the world. \r\n\r\n<b>International Network for Communications Reform</b>\r\nIn the last five years, the network of networks has begun to flex its collective muscles to reform the dominant global media system. Coalitions of activists, often in tandem with progressive government representatives, are calling for more democratic communications at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) (<See www.cris.org>); against the US push for the free trade of culture, with a Convention on Cultural Diversity, adopted by UNESCO in 2005 (http://www.cdc-ccd.org>); and for the protection of the global knowledge commons with a Development Agenda and a Treaty on Access to Knowledge and Technology at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).', 'More than a coalition of Nos, this new network of networks demonstrates that another communications is possible and already happening. Its strength is based in cooperation via social movement organizing, media reform campaigns and the adaptation of information and communications for the greater use of all. Almost all are severely challenged by their lack of sustainable funds and technical resources, and continuing inequities between members of racialized and gendered class differences and of cultural capital. However, faced with the stark realities of neo-liberal immiseration, the network continues to build, creating a complex lattice of local-local, regional (especially south-south), and trans-national links that circumvent the old colonial north-south linkages and power dynamics. If there is one glaring structural vacuum, it is the lack of involvement of US activists, and particularly those based in US communities and social justice movements. In the next five years, one of the key challenges will be for US activists to bring together efforts for media justice in the US, recognize the leadership of the rest of the world, and assist in mobilizing against the Washington agenda at home.\r\n\r\nWhat can people do to help build this network? In their own area, they can help support or produce programming for their local alternative communications media. They can also find and support the existing local, national and global campaigns to reform the mainstream corporate and state media. This is especially crucial in the US, whose media and media policy affect so much of the world. Finally they can educate themselves about whats going on in their own communities, national and especially internationally, and then help link the work of the local and global justice networks.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-18 10:41:57', '2007-03-12 18:51:06', NULL, NULL, 'Dept. of Media Studies, University of San Francisc', NULL, 181, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

At the same time, economic downturns have resulted in diminishing revenue streams for legislative support of higher education, and for-profit as well as international educational institutions offer increasing competition. Academic institutions need to explore the greater opportunities enabled by information technologies for inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional pedagogical and administrative partnerships, in order to revitalize their economic circumstances and re-establish their social relevance.', 'Institutions of higher education play a critical role in the maintenance and advancement of a nation and a culture. They are also often mired in organizational fiefdoms and disciplinary rivalries arising from competition over scarce resources. In turn, opportunities for collaboration are neglected that can advance the education of students and the production of knowledge.\r\n\r\nInformation communication technologies (ICTs) enable faculty and students to interact with others in academies across the nation and around the world. Courses engaging other institutions are being taught through video conferencing and computer-based classrooms; groups activities for students using databases and computer-generated learning objects are revolutionizing large lecture courses in physics and other sciences; researchers are using high performance computing to conduct experiments with international colleagues, at the same time that the extra computing power is leveraged to make available to students at their desktops expensive software through virtual computing labs.\r\n\r\nYet, the rapid and continual development of ICTs leave administrative budgets and personnel at universities struggling to adapt to the constant rate of change. In an age of vastly distributed information networks that can speed data and news around the globe, transparency and accountability are still lacking at traditional universities and other academic institutions. Despite the proliferation of communication devices and channels, faculty, staff, and students too often feel that their needs and views go unheard. Though the complexity of technological advances make it impossible for any one person or group to know all that is needed to make the best implementation plans, for example, ICT investment decisions continue to be made without soliciting other viewpoints.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, academic communication systems such as email and electronic calendaring that have become inextricably interwoven with the day-to-day operations of universities are still being run by multiple units and departments who have developed a sense of distrust and distance from central operations. Educational institutions within the same region and state continue to run routine technology networks individually instead of investigating the significant cost-sharing possible through inter-institutional cooperation, and beliefs in the necessity of institutional branding outweigh the advantages to be found in inter-collegiate curricula and teaching.\r\n\r\nPart of what hinders the realization of more of the collaborative advantages communication networks can offer is an administrative hierarchy that tends to favor corporate-style decision-making in the hopes of producing corporate-style efficiencies, especially in light of the huge costs and rapid change of educational technologies. Yet, Institutions of higher education are built on principles of peer-review of evidence, and communal sharing of knowledge. When the diverse constituencies of the academystudents, faculty, administrators, technical staffare not consulted in top-down decisions, and have no forums in which to engage with each other, those foundational principles are discarded and progressive initiatives can be resisted and even sabotaged.  \r\n\r\nA <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> article titled \"The Role of Colleges in an Era of Mistrust  lays out ten communication principles by which colleges can provide leadership and maintain good faith in the public eye. Reporting on a University of California controversy over the cancellation of an invited speaker by the universitys president without consulting faculty or students, the authors press for a process of communication that includes diverse perspectives: When it is possible to make deliberations open and transparent, colleges must do so. When open-door meetings are not prudent or practical, colleges must be careful to ensure that all the affected parties have a place at the table. Just as important, they must emerge with a clear account not only of what was decided but of how that decision was reached. \r\n\r\nMultiplying communication channels do not necessarily yield greater communication. An inclusive environment that fosters transparency and accountability within all academic sectors can go a long way to eliciting the sense of mission and dedication that characterizes the motives of people in choosing to be part of an educational community. Collaborative learning opportunities, inter-institutional partnerships, and inter-disciplinary scholarship are all developments that are supported by ICTs; creating a climate of openness and engagement across the university enterprise will further their realization.', 'ICTs can facilitate the development of new models of teaching, learning and research that take advantage of inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations in higher education and contribute to the quality of an information society. Such developments can be hindered by the persistence of traditional top-down decision-making that excludes the voices of the wider academic community, and in turn perpetuates a climate of disciplinary rivalry and entrenched silos.

In regard to a given research problem we face the necessity to point out the structures of interaction, stakeholders and regional agents of development, on the one hand, and the structures of communication and the infrastructures on the basis of which we can send and acquire reliable and objective information.', 'Since February 2001 CCNS cooperate (leading the Research program)  with The Democracy Works, a joint Russian-American R&D Program (http://www.thedemocracyworks.org) aimed at the creation of a network of community telecentres in Saint Petersburgs secondary schools. The main idea of the Program is to transform social active schools in St. Petersburg into a center of civil initiatives of the local community. In modern world,  schools are a place where future citizens learn their roles so making schools function more democratically is essential to democracy as an idea and an ideal. We believe that schools can be the nutshell structures for the formation and development of communities in large cities in Russia.\r\nAccording to our vision, we should provide equitable access to ICTs outside a formal educational framework, to the wider local community with a proposal for the establishment of multipurpose community centres for universal access to a range of services meeting community needs, with information technology as the backbone.\r\nIn this work we are trying to incorporate community networking (CNs) principles for the development of the project, which are based on several principles and goals, including: \r\n\r\n(1)	content provided by the members; \r\n(2)	bi-directional communication; \r\n(3)	focus on the local matter.\r\n\r\nSchool-based Centre should be open after-school hours for community access. This is an important source of sustainability to underwrite recurrent costs associated with the technology and imp-ove community-school relations. Equally important, this model extends the benefits of technology, the Internet and life-long learning to the entire community for a wide range of development applications. \r\nA sustainable prototype of the Centre are developing through the collaborative work of a partnership including the education community (schools and further education), local government, other private and public sector organizations. Schools and community organizations in the area have been already audited and their needs and interests noted for the development of pilot projects and provision of services.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to give local people and organizations in local communities the opportunity to produce and shape information that reflects their needs, thus creating a model of community development, taking both educational and economic advantage of the potential of the very latest multimedia interactive information technology. \r\n\r\nTraining is a vital aspect of this work. At the first stage of the project we need to form a permanent group from the school teachers and student leaders and provide for them a special training program in order to: \r\n\r\n- explore the concept of school-based Community Access Centres  in relation to their schools and communities; \r\n- connect the operation of a school-based Community Access Centres with the financial sustainability  of  their school; \r\n- begin the concrete steps necessary to plan, initiate, and operate a school-based Community Access Centre successfully. \r\n\r\nAlthough the technology component is an important part of our project, we believe that the effective use  of the Internet has less to do with technology, and more to do with people. Individuals make the difference. We should transform the computer from an arcane and mysterious piece of technology into a tool that opens a world of communication, understanding, collaboration and learning. \r\n\r\nWe are sure that at present times it is very important to strengthen efforts aimed at integration of Russian society (including low-income citizens who do not have a possibility to use Internet on commercial basis) into the world information -nformational openness of the society, practical realization of citizens\' rights to have a free access to information, citizens\' participation in information exchange through up-to-date ICTs we consider to be the most important prerequisite of deep democratic changes in post-communist countries, of fast development of all spheres of life of the society, including economics.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-21 09:56:29', '2005-09-14 11:29:39', NULL, NULL, 'Center CN & Info Policy Studies', NULL, 187, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

And, by doing it through the Internet, they are released from their local anchoring (typical of the BBS and \"Freenets\") to project themselves in a global form through interaction and co-operation with other community and city networks. These organisations do not question Capitalism: they tend to conform global networks aiming to integrate citizens to the Information Society and to diminish or abolish the Digital Divide. A significant case is the Global Partnership, which gathers together citizens networks from Europe, EEUU, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These citizens\' networks use computer-mediated communication (CMC), to expand their scope of activities, achieve better internal and external organization, and get articulated with citizen\'s movements around the world, among other uses.\r\nSupporters of CMC-based initiatives and activists involved in civic networking argue that not only can the new media be harnessed to reverse the decline of public communication and bias, but that they offer new possibilities to surpass all there was previously achieved using old media. Some of the claims civic networks make for electronic citizens networks are: efficiency and ease access to information; new tehcnology can be harnessed to measure citizens preferences in representative democracies, and it makes easier for citizens to respond, thus making political participation easier; CMC can transform the conditions of collective political action by creating new organizational possibilities; the received wisdom will no longer be simply received, but re-processed, re-created, and re-disseminated among other citizens networks; CMC can be used to promote the access of the majority of the population to information Society, thus increasing the access possibilities to education and jobs, among other advantages. \r\nSupporters of civic networks also claim the advantages of new media in terms of efficiency and competitiveness for the local economy (by creating micro enterprises related to informatics and telecommunications), and argue in favor of universal access to the Internet. Many explicitly make reference to a broader Habermasian view of the new media as providing a new arena of communication, a new public sphere that can replace the old one, now limited by fragmentation.\r\nFor Douglas Schuler, author of \"New Community Networks: Wired for Change\" (1998), new computer-based \"community networks\" are a recent innovation intended to help revitalize, strengthen, and expand existing people-based community networks, much in the same way that previous civic innovations have helped communities historically. He states that telecommunications are at the heart of almost all the aspects of contemporary everyday life. \r\nFrom the late nineties on, citizen\'s networks go several steps further: they do not only use ICTs as a main support and organizational means. They claim the building of Information Society as a \"New\" society. In order to do that, Citizens Networks have to build partnerships between diverse social actors: communities, governments, enterprises, and Universities. Richard Lowenberg (2000) explains: \"Community networks (CN) pragmatically integrate virtual communities of interests with geographic communities of place. CN, preceded by community radio and community television initiatives, continue working in and learning about the local realm of their increasingly tele-mediated society. CN are involved in extending local wired and wireless infrastructure: providing access, training and content brokering and development; provoking and facilitating new public-private networked partnerships (', '·	Are the social movements mentioned above representative symptoms of our present society?\r\n·	Are these social movements socially conservative or socially revolutionary?\r\n·	Have they succeeded, to the present, to make a significant political/economic/social/cultural changes among their target populations, and/or and among the society in a larger sense?\r\n·	Which common points have anti-globalization social movements and global community networks between them, and which are their main divergences? Will these movements be able to articulate themselves in the pursuit of common goals?', 'The solution was the creation of Global Community Network Partnership, the international alliance of organizations of civic nets of Europe, USA, Canada, in collaboration with citizens\' networks in the United States, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, Australia, Mexico, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, New Zealand, Japan, Russia, India and África. The initiative was created in Europe, with the implementation of the EPITELIO Project, developed between 1996 and 1998. This project, aimed to overcoming digital divide, and to generate a \"new\" society of the digital era, has a whole library dedicated to community networks (http://canet.upc.es/cn-library.html) . A firs Congress, ECN ´98, organized by Artur Serra in Barcelona in June 1998, gathered not only European representatives of community networks, but also CN members from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, United States, Canada, and Latin America. This first face-to-face contact  was followed by continuous exchanges, that were concretized in a series of national and regional meetings. These meetings built a \"track\" that led to the I World Congress of Community Networks, Global CN 2000, which took place in Barcelona, on November 2-4, 2000. One of its main outcomes was the agreement of a Global Community Networks Partnership. \r\nThe Barcelona Congress was promptly followed by the II World Congress of Community Networks, Global CN 2000, that took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on December 5-7, 2001. One of its main outcomes was the establishing of  the Guidelines for a Global CN Partnership organization and common actions\r\n(The Buenos  Aires  Agreement). It sates that the  GCNP \"can be a new experimental framework to be invented together (instead of copying traditional formulas); A partnership open to CN organizations and individuals and also academic, public and private organizations; Sharing  common values and aims also open to change\". \r\nThe Global CN congress is now the annual meeting of the civic networks, as well as of people interested in their reinforcement, from all over the world. Citizens´networks are the novel forms of civic associations of our digital era. They play an important role in the strenghtening of social networks, in any given population´s access and tools to use the knowledge and work opportunities of the Information Society, in citizens´ participation in local policy making, the creation of better working conditions, and the generation of innovative enterprises. Civic networks means different things to the different practitioners now spread around the world. However, we are reaching a collabotive way of work that facilitates the global as well as local work and actions.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2001-12-23 10:46:53', '2002-01-28 08:49:56', NULL, NULL, 'CONICET, Instituto de Investigaciones Gino Germani', NULL, 190, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(487, 467, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'How can we  improve public consultation between citizens and their public servants? By public consultation, I mean any of the ways a policy maker uses to engage the public in the decision-making process. This extends from simple surveys of citizen satisfaction with public services, to full citizen participation in decision-making, such as town budget setting or New England town meetings. But the most common situation is when an official or politician wants to find out citizens views on a proposed new development or policy change, such as producing consensus plans for town and regional developing in Germany or the Netherlands, reorganizing the school system in Northern Ireland, or running an enquiry into citizen\'s views on active citizenship, or what should be in broadcasting legislation in Ireland. This is not always called public consultation, but processes of engaging stakeholders in shaping the decisions that will affect them exist in every democratic country.\r\n\r\nOne problem is that current consultation techniques do not reach all groups in society, and do not always produce fair democratic dialogue. A second problem is that current techniques rarely help find consensus between different interests. It is easy to find out what people are campaigning for, but not what they will settle for if they have to compromise.\r\n\r\nIn short, the problem is: <i>how can we facilitate the participation of groups who currently don\'t take part, and use their input to find policy consensus?</i>', 'This pattern applies to any e-participation process that might fall under a wide definition of public consultation. This may be a formal public consultation initiated by government agencies, councils or parliaments on a new policy. Or a regular rule review or regulatory impact assessment required by legislation. But it is not limited to the formal processes required by legislation in many countries. It also covers any process in which an organization seeks to solicit the views of people affected by its decisions and actions (the stakeholders) and engage them in helping improve the organization\'s policies, decisions and work.\r\n\r\nExample contexts include: informal communications between representatives (MPs, councillors, ...) and their constituents; community and voluntary organizations attempting to consult their members and clients to determine their response to a policy initiative or government consultation; media or community sponsored discussions on a local issue; mediation between antagonistic communities who have conflicting interests (e.g. unionists and republicans in Northern Ireland, loggers and environmentalists in British Columbia; drivers and local residents along the route of a new road; employers and workers in Irish social partnership negotiations).\r\n\r\nNote that the pattern applies most strictly to the final context, where a government body is mediating between competing interests (e.g. in a planning inquiry). It is one of a number of patterns that can be followed in the other situations.', 'Current public consultation is deficient in a number of ways. Few people have the time or language skills to respond in writing to 20-page consultation documents. It is mainly professionals with a financial interest who do so. Rarely are public meetings attended by more than a few local retired people. The language of the documents is often obscure and couched in public sector jargon. The questions asked are the ones the officials feel safe asking, not the ones local communities would ask. The style is not one that engages the interest of anyone who is not a committed activist, let alone young people.\r\n\r\nThis has become very clear in places, such as devolved regions of the UK, where public consultation has suddenly grown very fast. In Northern Ireland, equality legislation forced 120 public authorities to consult on how they were planning to measure the equality impact (gender, race, religion, age, class) of each of their policies over the next 5 years. This led to 120 long documents being sent to the same 80-120 voluntary organizations, with 8 weeks to reply. Their choice was to ignore them (whereupon the officials could continue to do what they had done before) or to spend every day drafting replies, with very little time to talk to the people who would be directly affected.\r\n\r\nContrast this with experimental use of ICTs in public consultations in the Netherlands, the use of Internet chat to hold discussions between young people in East Belfast (the only neutral venue at the time) on human rights, research into on-line mediation support systems in Germany (for planning disputes), and electronic public meetings that bring together 6000 New Yorkers to discuss the future of the twin towers site.\r\n\r\nCan we design an appropriate use of software to support electronic public consultation that improves both its effectiveness in reaching different people, and its efficiency in controlling information overload and consultation fatigue?\r\n\r\nConsider consultation as an inter-organizational learning process. Knowledge is transfered between citizens and government, as they learn from each other. In particular, the policy makers need to better understand the needs, life experiences, and preferences of different actors in civil society (sometimes called stakeholders). In doing that, they act as both apprentices, learning from citizens, and mediators, managing disputes between different groups of citizens.\r\n\r\nWhen there are strong disagreements between different groups, a mediation or negotiation model is appropriate, based on what we understand about dispute resolution in communities that have been affected by conflict. This can be used to build a pattern of the process, and identify technologies to support different stages in that process.', 'Considering public consultation as a series of mediation and negotiation processes, it should be possible to participatively design software that supports these human processes, in the stages identified in the table below.\r\n<TABLE BORDER=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" WIDTH=\"100%\">\r\n  <TR>\r\n    <TH ROWSPAN=\"2\" WIDTH=\"20%\" BGCOLOR=\"#00FFFF\">Level of groupware needed to support stage</TH>\r\n    <TH COLSPAN=\"8\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\" BGCOLOR=\"#CCCCCC\">Stage of process</TH>\r\n  </TR>\r\n  <TR> \r\n    <TH COLSPAN=\"2\" WIDTH=\"20%\" BGCOLOR=\"#CCCCCC\">1.

Participants decide which innovations to adopt, and to whom and in what route the information will travel.  The goal is mutual understanding among members.  Friendships are formed based on technology sharing.  Many techies attempt to repeat this process within corporations and broader communities with little success.  Their fatal flaw: misunderstanding the communications channel.  \r\n\r\n Outside of innovators, the communications channel is off-line relationships.  As an IT support worker, I found that  computer fixes and work-arounds traveled  among friendships within a corporation, and many times skipped individuals sitting next to each other!  By utilizing the communications channels within the corporation, I was successful in getting new technologies and processes adopted.\r\n\r\n  When organizations see the pattern of technology adoption in this way, their own Divide seems bridgeable.  But more importantly, they will have a framework to understand how technology can be integrated in their communities.  And they will have a vision that can shape Internet use and policy for generations to come.  \r\nOn the community level, this pattern can be implemented in the following ways.  Identify early adopters and pair them with late adopters.  As an example, pair youth and their parents together to send money via the Web rather than Western Union.  Identify innovaters and early adopters in the neighborhoods who will talk and share knowledge about computers.  Connect these folks with techies who can help with more complicated issues.  Gab.  Make sure that the gossips in the neighborhood know how people in the neighborhood are using these new technologies, i.e., disseminate the re-inventions.  Let people observe someone using these technologies. This is the key motivator to try something new:  someone just like me is doing it. \r\n\r\n And if I can see it, I can believe it. \r\n\r\nAnd they will fly, and carry you to heights that we are just now dreaming.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2002-01-20 23:46:14', '2002-01-21 20:34:13', NULL, NULL, 'freelance writer', NULL, 200, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Unfortunately, the majority of these projects are contained within particular disciplines, including communications, cultural studies, English, and sociology, and seldom exist as a transdisciplinary object of study. While this makes for some interesting and grounded research, it fails to benefit from what we might call disciplinary cross-pollination.', 'Ten years ago, the first Conference in Cyberspace took place at the University of Texas at Austin. According to most accounts, the conference was invite-only and attracted some of the best minds around, including Michael Heim, Chip Morningstar, Marcos Novak, and Allucquere Rosanne (aka Sandy) Stone. A year later, the ideas crept to the rest of us, in the form of the appropriately entitled Cyberspace: First Steps, edited by Michael Benedikt.\r\n\r\nThroughout the last decade, many more steps have been taken. While Howard Rheingold\'s The Virtual Community examined communities in cyberspace, Sherry Turkle\'s Life on the Screen, along with the work of Amy Bruckman, Elizabeth Reid, and Stone, explored the formation of identities within online environments. By the mid-1990s, the first steps of an emerging field of study upgraded to a brisk jog. Under the altering guise of cyberculture studies or computer-mediated communication or Internet studies or social informatics, the field began to blossom with books like CyberSociety and Virtual Culture, both edited by Steve Jones, Internet Culture, edited by David Porter, and Network & Netplay, edited by Fay Sudweeks, Margaret McLaughlin, and Sheizaf Rafaeli. As the true millennium passes, the brisk jog has become a modest marathon, as reflected in book-length case studies like Nancy Baym\'s Tune In, Log On, Paulina Borsook\'s Cyberselfish, and Christine Hine\'s Virtual Ethnography, as well as critical subfields within the field, including Race in Cyberspace, edited by Beth Kolko, Lisa Nakamura, and Gilbert Rodman, women@internet: Creating New Cultures in Cyberspace, edited by Wendy Harcourt, and CyberSexualities: A Reader on Feminist Theory, Cyborgs, and Cyberspace, edited by Jenny Wolmark.', 'To date, most of the intellectual energy focused on this problem has been concerned with the *naming* of the field of study (See for example Bell and Kennedy, 2000; Gerlach and Hamilton, 2001; Silver, 2000) and very little spent on the *politics* of the emerging field (with the exception, perhaps, of Nakamura, 2000). Although very real academic turf wars exist on this matter, interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary collaborations yield insights too interesting, important, and powerful to ignore.

In most cases, technology for development is still only affecting 70-80 percent of the people under the poverty line; however, the bottom 20-30 percent are still not benefiting from the advances in ICT. Not until recently have technologies been developed specifically aimed at the most vulnerable poor. When speaking of the digital divide, unless the weakest of the weak (or the bottom n percent) are included in the solution, the digital divide will become a digital hole where the bottom n percent are destined to remain.', 'ICTs for regional development must fulfill four key requirements. First, the technology needs to be obtainable at a relatively low cost; second, the technology must become self-sustainable; third, users must have faith in the technology being provided; and lastly, the information must be immediately relevant to the users. Unless all four requirements are met, \"lasting\" constructive impacts on the most vulnerable will not be achieved. \r\n\r\nICT must meet the demands of the users. Technology is inherently supply driven. Advances in technologies have been brought about by goals that are not applicable to the needs of the most vulnerable. In order for the weakest to benefit from ICTs, technologies for development must become more demand driven. Communication channels must be able to reach the most isolated areas. In addition, terrain and the high cost of cable eliminate any possibility of linking remote areas to information; however, though the use of ICTs, information can now be transmitted via wireless communications. Nevertheless, cost must be within the sphere of attainability for even the poor. \r\n\r\nIn order for ICT to become viable for a developing economy, technology must become self-sustainable. This means, cost recovery must be achievable and management of the technologies must be transferable. \r\n\r\nTraditionally in developing economies, the weakest and most vulnerable are isolated in villages and are not conscious to the technologies of the day. In fact, most potential beneficiaries would not use the technologies, even if they were offered freely. There must be a sense of trust between the users and the producers of the ICTs. Technology is often seen as intimidating, even in developed economies. Therefore, exposure, training, and close relationships are key ingredients for promoting ICTs. Information pertinent to the users may often be private or personal (i.e. government documents, government programmes, financial loans, etc.). It may also be crucial to the user (i.e. heath care, weather reports, etc.). Trust must be built up in order for users to accept the new technologies.\r\n\r\nInformation must be relevant to the individuals using the technology. In addition, the information must be comprehensible to the users. Relevant information that cannot be read is of no use to an illiterate person. When dealing with developing economies illiteracy is as prominent an issue as access to technology. Setting up network architectures and communications infrastructures takes both time and money; nevertheless, many times the user interface, which is one of the most significant ingredients, gets overlooked.', 'In order to initiate a successful regional development ICT program aimed at every citizen in a developing economy, all of the above-mentioned requirements must be met. Without any of these four key requirements, the digital divide will remain a digital hole for the n percent that fall below numerous regional development programmes:\r\n\r\n1)	Developing Economies have the advantage of bypassing the high costs of conventional communication infrastructures through the use of ICTs. Instead of laying expensive copper wires, wireless technologies such as: VSAT (Vary Small Aperture Terminals) or VHF (radio) transmissions can handle the job at a substantially lower cost.\r\n\r\n2)	Government programmes and NGO that finance ICT projects will not produce lasting benefits unless the projects themselves become self-stainable.

Trust needs to be established between the intermediaries and the users of the technologies. In order to establish trust, users must see the technology as a benefit. The role of the intermediary is to facilitate the users needs and to act as an authority, thus emanating an image of credibility. Faith and trust can be more easily obtained if the intermediary is someone within the circle of users (i.e. a community leader, local villager, or a popular figure). \r\n\r\n4)	For the ICT to be successful, information must be easy to obtain.

The Divide is More Than Digital\r\n\r\n                               Think about economic development in emerging countries for a moment -- and you\r\n                               may conjure up grotesque images: smoke-belching factories, workers packed into\r\n                               dense megacities, the rape of rain forests, open-pit mines, the exploitation of\r\n                               women and children in sweatshops.\r\n\r\n                               These ugly images have aroused the conscience of people around the world, who\r\n                               have headed into the streets in recent years to protest the World Trade\r\n                               Organization, the World Bank, the G8, the World Economic Forum and other\r\n                               international organizations that are seen as part of the problem.\r\n\r\n                               While some of these images are accurate, the real truth is even worse.\r\n\r\n                               Much of the world is \"off-the-grid\" --\r\n                               disconnected from the most basic tools that\r\n                               might empower isolated people to emerge from\r\n                               the shadows. More than two billion people live\r\n                               without electricity; more than four billion rarely\r\n                               make a phone call. Three billion people have\r\n                               never seen a doctor; more than a billion adults\r\n                               cannot read or write at all. At the dawn of the\r\n                               21st Century, this disconnection is not only\r\n                               morally wrong -- it\'s also wasteful and\r\n                               unnecessary. It\'s a tragic squandering of human\r\n                               capital.\r\n\r\n                               The \"digital divide\" is much-lamented and debated by coalitions, conferences and\r\n                               corporations. But there are many more divides in addition to the digital -- electrical,\r\n                               telephonic, media, economic, educational, social and environmental. These divides\r\n                               reinforce each other; they amount to a virtually complete disconnect between the\r\n                               economic top third of humanity and the bottom third.\r\n\r\n                               Fortunately, there are constructive solutions; this article points to some of them, and\r\n                               to how anyone can get involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               2. Top-down Economic Aid -- Bankrupt\r\n\r\n                               We in the connected world know the consequences of the great divides intuitively;\r\n                               we see the ugly images, we hear the tortured sounds, we read the tragic stories.\r\n                               But we avoid thinking about it, because it paralyzes us -- the problems are too\r\n                               complex, the solutions just seem to create more problems; there is apparently no\r\n                               meaningful action that one person can take. Out of sight, out of mind.\r\n\r\n                               And out of pocket, too, apparently. Macro political and economic policies are a\r\n                               reflection of the common paralysis. The money spent by the West, especially the\r\n                               United States, on aid to poor nations has declined steadily since the mid-70s. A\r\n                               fearless indictment on the subject of economic development policies under the\r\n                               Clinton Administration (which are now in the process of being tightened even\r\n                               further by the Bush Administration) came from a Harvard professor, Jeffrey Sachs,\r\n                               speaking in the cathedral of the World Bank in Washington:\r\n\r\n                                    In 1998, United States foreign assistance totaled around $8.8 billion, or 0.12 of\r\n                                    one percent of the Gross National Product. And of this derisory sum, only\r\n                                    around one-sixth went to the least developed countries. A sixth of\r\n                                    twelve-hundredths of one-percent of GDP amounted to the grand total of\r\n                                    around $4.95 per American in 1998 for the world\'s least developed countries.\r\n                                    This is $4.95 per year in a country where the average income is more than\r\n                                    $30,000...\r\n\r\n                                    For the complete article, see\r\n                                    http://www.greenstar.org/butterflies/Sachs-Aid-Analysis.pdf\r\n\r\n                               Big business is not asleep to the implications, and to its responsibility to play a\r\n                               pro-active role. Mark Moody-Stuart, Chairman of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group,\r\n                               said recently,\r\n\r\n                                    ... I believe the most immediate challenge is to set the poorest countries on a\r\n                                    path to sustainable development. It\'s not just that a quarter of humans live on\r\n                                    less than $1 a day. Or that the gap between them and others is widening. What\r\n                                    really matters is that the poorest are going backwards... I don\'t think this will be\r\n                                    accepted for much longer in a shrinking world -- where their misery is clear to\r\n                                    us, and our wealth to them. Responsibility for action is widely shared -- for\r\n                                    more and better aid, debt relief, fairer trade, investment.\r\n\r\n                                    For the complete statement, see\r\n                                    http://www.greenstar.org/butterflies/Shell-Statement.htm\r\n\r\n                                \r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                3.

It\'s time to try some new ideas: bold, impossible ideas. Ideas in\r\n                               which everyone, rich and poor, north and south, connected and disconnected, can\r\n                               participate and create value.\r\n\r\n                               A good starting point is a skeptical look at one of the most powerful transforming\r\n                               forces in the developed world -- the connecting power of the Web. Though the\r\n                               Internet is not the panacea that many hoped for, it does serve as an example of a\r\n                               new style of approach -- communications from the edge rather than the center,\r\n                               from many individuals to many other individuals, globally, unmediated, without a\r\n                               centralized point of control. Together with other tools, perhaps the Internet can\r\n                               teach us something about unleashing hidden value in the developing world.\r\n\r\n                               As Larry Irving, former Deputy Secretary of the US Department of Commerce\r\n                               commented,\r\n\r\n                                    \'Think how powerful the Internet is.

But those vestiges of post-colonialism create dependency, drain human\r\n                               potential, devastate the environment and cannot be sustained. And those\r\n                               sweatshop paychecks are only available in crowded, toxic third-world cities: the\r\n                               labor of the two billion disconnected who live in 600,000 remote villages is so far\r\n                               away that it\'s not even worth exploiting.\r\n\r\n                               There is an unknown, unrealized asset of the disconnected that exists precisely\r\n                               because of their disconnectedness. It is priceless, unique, of universal value, and\r\n                               easily exchanged worldwide.\r\n\r\n                               That asset of the disconnected is their voice, their vision, their intimate connection\r\n                               to tradition, to the earth, their families, community, their history, wisdom and\r\n                               legends: their culture.

We in the developed\r\n                               world may have vital lessons to learn from traditional people, in terms of how and\r\n                               why to live as a human being.\r\n\r\n                               Can these cultural expressions be recorded, organized in a digital package,\r\n                               presented by the people themselves in a living form to share with the world, without\r\n                               perverting their simplicity and originality? Can markets be created for these digital\r\n                               culture products that generate income for traditional people, to bring them the\r\n                               health, education, energy and communications services they need and close the\r\n                               great divides, and earn for them the tools of an independent future? Can this be\r\n                               done in a sensitive, decentralized way so that delicate traditions are not polluted in\r\n                               the process?\r\n\r\n                               In Sarawak, Borneo, where this process is underway; a tribal leader explains:\r\n\r\n                                    ...in our race to modernize we must respect the ancient cultures and traditions\r\n                                    of our peoples. We must not blindly follow that model of progress invented by\r\n                                    European wealth; we must not forget that this wealth was bought at a very\r\n                                    high price. The rich world suffers from so much stress, pollution, violence,\r\n                                    poverty, and spiritual emptiness. The wealth of the indigenous communities\r\n                                    lies not in money or commodities, but in community, tradition, and a sense of\r\n                                    belonging to a special place (Earth Island Institute, 1997, p.3).\r\n\r\n                                \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               5. The Significance of a Song, an Image, a Story...\r\n\r\n                               There is a \"cultural ecology\" element to this idea as well. The diversities of human\r\n                               language, history, music, legend and image are just as important to protect as the\r\n                               physical ecology of ocean, atmosphere, earth, rainforest and river. As the\r\n                               developed world\'s McCulture becomes increasingly homogenized, the distinct,\r\n                               varied voices of the villages of Honduras, Tanzania, Jordan, New Mexico,\r\n                               Bangladesh and Mongolia will be seen as just as precious -- and just as vital to the\r\n                               survival of the earth -- as the redwood, the butterfly, the eagle, the whale, the\r\n                               hummingbird and the tiger.\r\n\r\n                                                       During the course of colonial expansion and\r\n                                                       industrial development, the rich nations became rich\r\n                                                       at the expense of traditional culture. Old ways,\r\n                                                       binding us to one another and our surroundings,\r\n                                                       were thought to impede \"progress,\" so they were\r\n                                                       cast aside. Now that the rich world has achieved\r\n                                                       material wealth, we faintly recognize what we\r\n                                                       abandoned, but cannot recover. We\'re drowning in\r\n                                                       a sea of riches, and starving from lack of a reason\r\n                                                       for it. An instinctive sense of meaning has been lost,\r\n                                                       a void that we barely understand, yet feel intensely.\r\n                                                       Could that sense of meaning be the most precious\r\n                                                       resource of the new century?\r\n\r\n                               The traditional voices which retain that meaning and connection are endangered,\r\n                               just as much as the ozone layer and the harp seal. Oral traditions are fragile, like an\r\n                               ecosystem -- they depend on the continuous effort of fathers speaking to sons, of\r\n                               mothers speaking to daughters, of old people sharing honored history, and of\r\n                               young people growing up in respect for the wisdom of their village heritage.\r\n\r\n                               These fragile links are easily fractured in remote communities. Cultures which took\r\n                               thousands of years to refine can vanish in a couple of generations if their young\r\n                               people stop believing in them. This is happening all over the world today, as young\r\n                               people in traditional communities are lured away to the bright lights of the\r\n                               megacities. Our generation could see a great spasm of cultural extinction, as\r\n                               priceless human legacies that reach back into pre-history vanish.\r\n\r\n                               Can markets be created for digital culture products that generate income for\r\n                               traditional people? Can these cultural expressions be recorded, organized in a\r\n                               digital package, presented by the people themselves in a living form to share with\r\n                               the world, without perverting their originality? Could the resulting income be used\r\n                               to bring to remote villages the health, education, energy and communications\r\n                               services they need and close the great divides, and earn for them the tools of an\r\n                               independent future? Can this be done in a sensitive, decentralized way so that\r\n                               delicate traditions are not polluted in the process?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               6. Balanced Prosperity\r\n\r\n                               Wealth that begins with this idea of \"cultural ecology\" builds pride, strengthens the\r\n                               family and the village, makes it possible for people to earn income where they live\r\n                               without being exiled to serfdom in the city...and through creating new,\r\n                               hard-currency income it allows them to acquire critical basic resources like clean\r\n                               water, access to health care and education, electric power, telephones, computers,\r\n                               and a connection to the Internet.\r\n\r\n                               With these tools, people can begin to build a balanced prosperity for themselves,\r\n                               creating their own jobs and income, with access to both local and world markets.\r\n                               They can harness their entrepreneurial instincts -- and break the vicious cycle of\r\n                               dependency and indignity which traditional economic aid programs, for all their\r\n                               good intentions, tend to perpetuate. On the cultural ecology platform, many other\r\n                               important initiatives can flourish, such as improved local trade and marketing,\r\n                               teleworking via satellite, micro-finance, telemedicine, decentralized publishing and\r\n                               broadcasting, international student and teacher networking, and the use of\r\n                               renewable energy technologies.\r\n\r\n                               The forgotten and isolated billions who labored in 20th century sweatshops could\r\n                               become the creative, prosperous citizens, teachers and partners of the 21st\r\n                               century.

Some have argued that media has become so vivid, so real that people can live in them. Media literacy is the process of decoding and making sense of all media. It allows us to critically view media and to evaluate the role that media play in our lives. When someone is media literate, he or she has the skills to identify the ideological implications and manipulative means of media systems and practices.  Unfortunately, exposure to media does not necessarily suggest that people have the critical skills to understand how media systems work or how they are relating to media messages.  Further, there is very little training in media education.  In most places in the world, public education resists the changing media environments.  Also, teachers are not given specific instruction in the workings of media, nor are they trained in the methods of media practices.  Of course, it must be mentioned that in some places in the world, media has a foothold in the curriculum of public education but rarely does this curriculum come with the pedagogical training educators need to reach their audiences.  The study of media has developed into complex systems of understanding, analysis, and synthesis.  Yet, media study is not thought of within the context of traditional academic disciplines. As a result, we live in a world where ubiquitous media messages, without critical appraisal impact our world.', 'Masterman, in particular, stresses the student\'s development of \"critical autonomy\" as a primary objective of media education.  In Teaching the Media, he argues that the key task of media teachers is to \"develop in pupils enough self-confidence and critical maturity to be able to apply critical judgments to media texts which they will encounter in the future\" (24).  Thus, the primary objective of media education is not simply to foster critical awareness and understanding, but to develop a student\'s awareness of his or her role as an active agent when engaged by all media, no matter the context. The \"critical autonomy\" approach to media education differs from its predecessors in three ways.  First, the pedagogical practices of this approach stress investigative strategies; that is, teaching and learning are emphatically student centered and inquiry oriented.  Second, the process of making meaning through critical investigation is emphasized; that is, strategies of decoding are stressed within pedagogy.  And third, visual literacy and media literacy, rather than an exclusively \"print-oriented\" literacy, function as the criteria for evaluation of student work.', 'Until very recently if somebody complained about the media, the typical response was to \"turn off the TV.\" Suddenly it has become commonplace to think of media not as an autonomous system but as an important element in a cultural environment that, like the physical environment, needs to be monitored for degradation and corruption. We need to be able to recognize biases and other problems that we encounter with existing media systems. All messages are made with some sense of the people receiving them.  People filter these messages based on their beliefs, values, attitudes, behaviors, and past experiences. Every media message is communicated for a reason  to entertain, to inform, and usually to persuade. Behind every message is a purpose and point of view. The advertisers purpose is more direct than a program producers, though both may seek to entertain. Understanding their purposes and knowing whose point of view is being expressed and why is crucial to being media literate. Yet the basic motive behind most media programs is profit through practices like the sale of advertising space and sponsorships. These reasons are also important to consider because all media messages are owned. They are designed to yield results, provide profits, and pay for themselves. All news and entertainment programming, including film and television, try to increase their audiences to attract advertising dollars. Understanding the profit motive is key to analyzing media messages. Messages are communicated through the use of elements like sound, video, text, and photography.  But most messages are enhanced by the use of visual and technical elements through camera angles, special effects, editing, or music. Analyzing how these features are used in any given message is critical to understanding how that message attempts to persuade, entertain, or inform. Because messages are limited in both time and purpose, rarely are all the details provided. Identifying the issues, topics, and perspectives that are not included can often reveal a great deal about the purposes of media messages. Because media messages tell only part of the story and different media have unique production features, it helps to evaluate multiple messages on the same issue. This allows you to identify multiple points of view, some of which may be missing in any single message or medium.\r\n\r\nThese are but some of the issues to be discussed when considering the problems and challenges associated with the term media literacy.  Other approaches include concerns about monitoring ownership and the political economy of these systems in the global economy, about interpretation, evaluation and critique of media messages, about knowledge of how media impact and influence, and about how to address the changing needs of a world where media constantly evolves. \r\n\r\nA critical autonomy approach to media education addresses these concerns within an educational context.  As part of the school reform movement of the past decade, media education scholarship assumes a student centered pedagogical practice in which the student is viewed as an active, aware participant in learning, a lifelong learner, and a self-motivated and self-directed problem solver.  This image of the learner is an essential consideration not only in the design of media education, but also within the larger pedagogical frame in which the curriculum is negotiated.  According to Boomer (1992), negotiating the curriculum means deliberately planning to invite students to contribute to, and to modify, the educational program, so that they will have a real investment both in the learning journey and in the outcomes.  Negotiation also means making explicit, and then confronting, the constraints of the learning context and the non-negotiable requirements that apply.  (14) Masterman argues further that \"if students are to understand media texts . . . then it will obviously be helpful if they have first-hand experience of the construction process from the inside\" (26).  To this end, media education includes media production, what Masterman dubs \"practical work,\" as a pedagogical practice which enables students to create media products.  Thus, students are actively engaged both with the production of media and the workings of the classroom.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of their interest in student centered learning, scholars of media education aim to develop curricula which consider the forms and practices of education and of pedagogy.  Curricula which are inquiry oriented tend to offer activities which stress critical strategies, and pedagogy centers around the creation of a dialogue -- i.e., not just discussion, but the kind of talk that leads to dialectical thinking.  In this context, divergent readings of texts are positively valued for their potential to stimulate further analysis and thus growth in understanding. The aim of media education is to encouraged a heightened self-consciousness about the processes of interpretation and meaning making and provide people with an opportunity to recognize that everyone uses a selective and interpretive process to examine media texts.  This process and the meanings obtained depend on psychological, social, cultural, and environmental factors.  In this view, then, media education strives to enable people to understand how media texts come to have a range of meanings or readings ascribed to them, and to develop even richer, more critical readings. \r\n\r\nContemporary media educators are also beginning to challenge traditional notions of literacy.  Literacy, by definition, refers to the ability to read and write.  But scholars insist that there are \"languages\" other than print, such as those related to the mass media, which also need to be considered within the definition of \"literacy.\"  Visual literacy, for example, has been described by Messaris (1994) as \"greater experience in the workings of visual media coupled with a heightened conscious awareness of those workings\" (2).  And Masterman has argued that since both print and visual literacy involve \"the deconstruction of texts by breaking through their surface to reveal the rhetorical techniques through which meanings are produced\" (127), any education for \"literacy\" should focus on that process, rather than on the symbolic form of a particular set of \"texts.\"', 'Education and educational practices need to shift to address the changing media environments. We need to perform more public media criticism. We need to engage with media more closely to keep them in check and to be informed as to how we are responding and why. We need to be more serious about our media environments and foster greater awareness of the impact and influence media systems have on daily life. We must arm all people with the knowledge, skills, and values a media education program provides  granting people access to new technology and information about its workings and ideological implication. Finally, we need more alternative communication systems to counter these problems.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2002-03-22 15:07:57', '2007-03-11 21:42:18', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 345, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This mass connectivity tends to dilute our sense of connectedness to place.

While\r\nthe very definition of what a community is can be a matter of debate, it\r\nremains that concerns about the erosion of local communities have been \r\nmounting since the middle of the 20th century.  The scapegoats for this\r\ndecline are many:  television, automobiles, work pressures, declining \r\nreligious and family values, Shopping Malls, and WalMarts are just a few\r\nof the more popular laments.  It remains that, regardless of source, the \r\ndecline of geographically propinquitous communities is real.  A counterpoint\r\nto this decline has been found, over the last 25 years, in the rise of \r\nvirtual communities.  The communities are often bound by neither space \r\nnor time, but rather by common interests.', 'The common ground in both the decline in geographically propinquitous\r\ncommunities and the rise of virtual communities is the relative decline\r\nand rise in the use of media in these communities.\r\n\r\nIn Taylor, Groleau, Heaton, and Van Every\'s \"The Computerization of Work:\r\nA communication perspective\" (2001), an organization is described \r\n(following Morgan, 1986) as \"a very special kind of object/subject.  As an \r\nobject, it has no substantiality.  It is associated with a physical \r\ninfrastructure ... but, in and of itself, it is none of these.  Fundamentally, \r\nit is no more than an idea, a construction of the imagination.\"  Taylor, in \r\nthis work and others, promotes the idea that an organization is a conversation\r\nand a text, in which the conversation creates a text of collective knowledge\r\nand the text structures subsequent conversation.\r\n\r\nThe same can be said for a community.  It is a product of social imagination\r\nthat occurs in the intersection of conversations between community members\r\nthat build up, over time, into a text of shared experiences, knowledge, \r\nvalues, and ways of doing things together, including having conversations.\r\nThese conversations occur within the context of media.  These texts are stored\r\nwithin the context of media.\r\n\r\nA community doesn\'t die when a plant closes, or a shopping mall opens three towns\r\nover, or a Walmart opens at the edge of the next town, or one person more or \r\nless embraces a particular religious philosophy.  It dies when people stop \r\ntalking to each other.  When a downtown area closes a town has one less place\r\nto get together as a town.  When people stop going to religious services they\r\nhave one less opportunity to interact with neighbors.  When a person commutes\r\nan hour each way to a job in a nearby city, there is less time to chew the fat\r\nwith neighbors.  When a local newspaper closes or local radio station starts \r\ntaking a national feed there is one less place for the community to share local\r\ninformation.  And bit by bit the text of the community fades and the conversation \r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nA community doesn\'t arise from a virtual nowhere because its participants \r\ncouldn\'t have talked about there interests with their neighbors.  They simply \r\nhad an easy communication channel to other people who weren\'t simply tolerant\r\nof each others odd interests, but are genuinely interested in the same things.\r\nChats build into e-mails, shared web sites, Instant Messenger sessions, \r\ntelephone calls, and even real life meetings.\r\n\r\nA community can therefore be imagined as an ecology of media in which more is\r\nbetter, and in which a diversity of media act to support the others.  The\r\navailability of these media enables the conversation, supports storage of the\r\ntext, and re-enforces the community.', 'If you want to build up a community, you need to enhance the opportunities that\r\nmembers of the community have to communicate.  There are two basic ways to do\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>enhance the range of media that community members have to interact with each other\r\n<li>increase the use of existing media within the community\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nBoth solutions are important, and support each other.  You probably can\'t stop\r\na nearby WalMart or shopping mall from pulling people away from your downtown \r\ncommunity hub.  But you can invent new reasons for people to come together in\r\nyour downtown area, and perhaps build a new base in the process.\r\n\r\nSmall communities probably can\'t readily stem the tide of people commuting to\r\njobs in nearby cities, and thereby spending less time in town, but they can\r\nprovide network connectivities (web sites, community bulletin boards,\r\ncommunity calendars, community discussion groups, etc) that help to tie \r\ncommuters back to the community even when they are are work.\r\n\r\nThese ideas are intended to be suggestive of ways in which communities can build \r\nup their local media ecology\'s even as other forces diminish them.  They cannot\r\nreturn us to the \"idyllic\" past.  Network technologies do enable new communities,\r\nand those communities are unlikely to dissapear anytime soon, but local \r\ncommunities can be maintained and enhanced so long as attention is paid to \r\nmaintaining the conversation and text that is that community; and this\r\nmaintenance is performed by sustaining and expanding the range of media\r\nin which that conversation happens.\r\n\r\nThe notion of a community as an ecology of media is summarized by the summary\r\nequation:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pages.prodigy.net/davis_foulger/articles/images/communityMediaEquation.gif\">\r\n\r\nin which C = Community, M = Medium, and U = Usage of Medium.\r\n\r\nIt suggests that we build communities by building a communities communication\r\ninfrastructure and finding ways of encouraging its use within the community.\r\n\r\nMany papers at this conference appear to support this general notion.  Support\r\ncan also be found in parts of the extant digital divide literature.  Foulger \r\n(2001), for instance, provides evidence that a bridging of the digital divide \r\nmay require an earlier bridging of the telephone divide, and perhaps other \r\nmedia divides as well.\r\n\r\nThis is an evolving concept, and discussion is welcomed.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2002-04-24 08:57:35', '2002-05-08 14:14:07', NULL, NULL, 'Oswego State University', NULL, 122, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Reliable control over one\'s own identity and relationship information is essential to establishing trust in the system.\r\n\r\nOver the last two years a loose network of several dozen people calling themselves LinkTank have come together to discuss these ideas and how to go forward with implementing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>LinkTank Statement of Purpose: </b>\r\n\r\n<i>LinkTank is dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital communications platform, operated as a public interest utility, that will strengthen civil society by enabling people to connect, communicate, make transactions, and self-organize in a manner that is consistent with the highest principles of democracy and reflects an enlightened understanding of the fragile beauty of our planet. We will bring together, develop, promote, and hold as a global public commons, software tools and infrastructure that facilitate the emergence, growth, and vitality of social networks of individuals and organizations who share ecological and social justice values, as articulated in the Earth Charter.</i>\r\n\r\nLink Tank is currently supporting the development of prototype social network software originally conceived as a high-level networking tool for professionals within trade associations. It addresses the personal referral side of social networking very well; however, it doesn\'t by itself directly address two other related areas we had identified-messaging and mapping.\r\n\r\nBy messaging, we mean specifically using identity \"meta-data\" to enable new message filtering and profiling tools for \"attention management.\" We are currently experimenting with a topically filtered messaging prototype. Messaging may be critically important as it moves the software from the realm of occasional use to central daily use. An inherently spam-free approach could fuel rapid adoption.\r\n\r\nBy mapping we mean the ability to generate meaningful depictions of network participants\' interests and opinions, independent of specific identity. In other words, a user of the system could see how many people registered an interest in a topic without seeing their names or other identifying information. This functionality could be provided by other applications using the same identity data.\r\n\r\nSocial identity data exchange protocols will most likely evolve only as a result of the implementation of tools developed for objectives different from mainstream corporate needs.  The integration of such tools and technologies points toward a key issue in developing software for purpose-centered, trust-based social networks.  Maintaining open standard protocols for data exchange as a global commons is crucial.', 'We have identified a number of specific areas in which new tools, beyond existing email, listserv, and websites, could change the nature of interaction between individuals and organizations on the Net.\r\n\r\nIndividual Control of Identity - A \"meta-data\" self-description that each entity (individual, organization, or group) creates when they begin using the tools, and continues to control exclusively, is the foundation of this line of thinking.\r\n\r\nMessaging - Once each user has electronic identity, it would be possible to create an opt-in spam-free message system, which not only can filter messages, but also can file them for later reference. Such a system could also enable voting for the relative importance of widely circulated messages by passing on small incrementing pointers to messages on community servers.\r\n\r\nInterest Mapping - With the existence of identity data it would also become possible to generate \"maps\" showing the relationship among many individuals and entities, both conceptually and geographically.\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Referral - Electronic representation of relationship data could allow brokering software to extend personal referrals across more than one degree of separation.\r\n\r\nPolling - Opinion polling and even voting are practical internal tools for co-ops and organizations now. In the long run, questions of general interest could be brought before the larger network through a qualifying initiative process. This might ultimately allow democratic self-sampling of global public opinion among participants in the system.\r\n\r\nIndependent Media Aggregation - Independent media channels are proliferating rapidly around the world. There are many open questions around the aggregation and customization of these sources as well as deeper questions of editorial quality and funding.\r\n\r\nConsumer-Directed Commerce - Efforts to create tools to allow global citizens to better evaluate the ecological and social costs and consequences of our consumer and investment decisions, aggregate our collective buying power, and facilitate sharing product evaluations could be integrated within this network.\r\n\r\nFinancial Services - For some the Holy Grail of the system would be the aggregation of our collective financial clout and capital to make real changes in the world through redirecting lending and investment into just, sustainable, ventures.\r\n\r\nThese tools will ultimately involve the combination of many efforts.  Our job is both to create an attractor for existing efforts and to catalyze the new work needed to integrate them into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  At this point we are searching for those holding various pieces of the puzzle, bringing them together, and turning them face up to see how they might fit together.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2002-04-30 08:50:45', '2002-05-10 22:31:01', NULL, NULL, 'Planetwork', NULL, 233, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

In this new group trust bridges can be built that allow people to engage in transactions with other individuals, governments, and business entities.

This kind of economic empowerment can only happen if the collection and use of personal financial information is for the improvement of people\'s financial health, not to support big business.\r\n\r\nThe flow of personal financial information from individuals to financial institutions and businesses was formulated by business to \"do business\".  Businesses have been the record keepers and judges of people\'s financial fitness to engage in business transactions.  This control of the people\'s financial information gives business power to control the financial markets.\r\n\r\nThe potential for a change in this information flow is now available with the development of information technology.  Personal financial information can flow a different direction as people begin to collect and manage their own financial information.  We see the advent of this with popular software programs like Microsoft Money and online banking.  However, these types of programs have no muscle in them.\r\n\r\nWhat we really need is a whole new way of doing business.  We need a system in which people are in control of the collection, management, manipulation, privatization, and use of their own financial information.  Greater control of their financial identity by individuals would create economic empowerment for many people.  The problem is that the idea for accomplishing this runs counter culture to business, as we know it.  And the idea here is not to destroy business.  The idea is to make business serve the people.  \r\n\r\nInformation is a powerful tool and if used collectively can create energy like water behind a dam.  Seeing how the personal information collected by business really belongs to the people so should its collective energy.  If people took back their information and collectively used this energy they could change the nature of business today.\r\n\r\nWe need a system to privatize financial information in which individuals are the keepers of their own financial identity.

This system would not look to encryption technology to protect individual privacy.  Instead this group would be a social system that allows people to \"still be real\".  A new understanding would develop giving individuals the choice to disclose certain information when they are with friends and associates and become anonymous when they are interacting with strangers.  Financial information could not be tracked in the way it is now but   authentification of identity and auditing of financial information would be an integral part of the system.  Building trust so that transactions can go on as usual would be a key element.  Inside the financial community the individual would be able to collect, manage and dispense their own information.

This is a report on a project to create new software for online discussion forums.', 'Online education, newsgroup software, bulletin board software, World Wide Web, Online community', 'The hot debate of a few years ago over the automation of higher education has died down. College administrators have come to terms with fact that teachers and students are not enthusiastic about substituting mechanical simulacra for more traditional personal relationships. As unrealistic dreams for the Internet fade, colleges find themselves pouring money and technical support into online classes. After initial resistance, many teachers are doing their best with low tech solutions, delivering courses by email or discussion forums. Online education has not transformed the university, but has become a standard educational experience based on human interaction, albeit in a strange new medium. \r\n\r\nThe question is not whether universities are technologically obsolete in the Age of the Internet. Instead, we need to improve online learning in a traditional academic setting. Much of the current software, unfortunately, has been supplied by the very companies that inspired the dream of teacherless classrooms. Although these products have many excellent features, they are not designed for the discussion-based pedagogy that thrives online.  \r\n\r\nSoftware for online education will surely evolve. The first programs in any new field are usually ill adapted to the needs of the very users they were intended to serve. Gradually, clumsy interfaces give way to better designs that make it easy to perform complex tasks. Helpful innovations spread quickly to competing programs. Features such as spell checkers or the style sheets and templates of word processors become standards. Professor Andrew Feenberg of San Diego State University has received a three year grant to develop new software for online discussion forums. The grant is supported by the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, an agency of the US Dept. of Education. The goal of the TextWeaver project is to establish new standards for online discussion forums, adapting the software to the needs of teachers and students meeting on the Internet.', 'Todays discussion forums resemble the newsgroup software devised in the early days of the Internet. Newer programs run nicely in Internet browsers, a significant advance, but they lack specific features responding to the needs of teachers and students. These include easy ways to keyword material for later review, to reply to multiple messages, and to work offline. Teachers also need a better way of filing the most important messages they write for reuse in later offerings of their courses. TextWeaver will make all this far more convenient. And as we have learned, convenience is the ultimate feature in consumer applications of the computer.\r\n\r\nTextWeaver looks a bit like email clients such as Eudora or Outlook, but adapted to the discussion forum environment. These email programs have accustomed us to filters, address books, mailboxes, and quoted messages in the reply window, all features it would be hard to live without. But there is no comparably efficient interface for discussion forums. TextWeaver will make working with the messages and threads of a discussion forum as natural as managing email.\r\n\r\nDiscussion forums usually thread messages by subject or author, but messages in an online forum may refer to multiple topics and authors, associating a variety of ideas and sources. Threads and search programs are sometimes useful for finding items for review, but quite often fail us because authors are not consistent in their use of the reply function and choice of keywords. The helpful automatic quotation of messages in the reply composition window we have grown accustomed to in email clients becomes impractical when participants are replying to several messages at once. Clearly, we need new tools to deal with online discussion.\r\nTextWeaver solves these problems by means of reader implemented keywording. Instead of a mailbox window as in Eudora or Outlook, TextWeaver posts a keyword window alongside the users browser. This window contains a list prepared by the teacher and sent to all students in the class. Students can make their own additions as the course progresses. As the user reads, he or she drags and drops these keywords onto the text, marking it with a hypertext link for later review. When the time comes to study for the test, to prepare a summary of the discussion, or to grade students contributions to the forum, the material is all there, classified neatly and easy to access in a user created keyword thread.\r\nReplying to multiple messages is also difficult at present. Discussion forum software assumes that each reply addresses a single message, but that is often not the case. TextWeaver allows the user to review and quote from several messages by enabling drag and drop of selected passages from incoming messages to the composition window. In this way, users can build a context for their own comments on current discussions.\r\n\r\nTeachers complain that managing online discussion is time-consuming. TextWeaver addresses this problem with easy-to-use filing. A tab on the keyword window opens a simplified version of Explorer to which messages can be saved at the time of composition. Teachers can store useful messages such as opening comments and topic raisers in this convenient location. When the course is offered again, the texts can be pulled up easily and sent to the discussion forum.\r\nMost teachers and students still use dial up connections when off campus, and many have Internet access only through a personal telephone line. When composing and sending messages to the forum, they must block access to friends, family and business associates for long periods. If their connection is lost, their work is lost too. Moreover, users outside of the United States face additional problems and costs as phone service is often less reliable than in the U.S. and offshore Telecoms charge users by the minute.\r\n\r\nClearly, working offline is the answer, but it\'s not easy with typical discussion forum software. TextWeaver offers a seamless solution in which users need not even be aware of whether they are online or offline. The software can be set to automatically move them efficiently between working on their home computer and connecting to the university server.  \r\n\r\nTextWeaver\'s distribution strategy encourages widespread adoption and adaptation. The program will work as an add-on to existing online educational software, so colleges will not have to abandon familiar server based programs such as Blackboard and WebCT. Under development at San Diego State University, the basic version will be a free open source product running under several operating systems and available sometime in 2002. Its designers and developers hope to see the program improved and customized as it circulates in the educational and commercial community. With time, TextWeaver will set new standards of organization and convenience for all online discussion forums.

Our modification was to train everyone to edit HTML, and to pair up into editorial teams of two.  New members would be trained by placing them into one of these teams, and working on the project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of LA was slightly different from SF.

Eight seems to be a good number, and it might be a good idea to spin off additional editorial opportunities when the number starts to approach eight.

A good starting point is to make an inventory or a map of the venues or settings in a locality where groups of people discuss question of public importance. Much useful information can be gathered about these settings: what issues are readily addressed and what ones are discouraged? what kinds of people take part and what kinds are barred or made unwelcome? is power over the setting found at the local or national or transnational level? how adequate is the information available to participants? what kind of power does the setting hold for making and enforcing decisions? An inventory along these lines reveals much about the resources for collective action available in the locality and about the biases built into them. Effective local action often requires initiating new political settings with new rules of access and a new issue focus. It is often facilitated by links to wider, more central, sources of information and power that are supportive and that are locally trusted. No single strategy or approach is available to address local needs because the circumstances, skills, resources, and social systems vary enormously from place to place. But mapping the space of existing public action is a very good starting place for those who want to act effectively.

Without understanding who has power, how the power is wielded, and how that power can be kept within legitimate boundaries, people with less power can be ignored, swindled, lied to, led into war, or otherwise mistreated.', 'This pattern should be considered in any situation in which institutionalized power is a strong influence.', 'The powers of ordinary men are circumscribed by the everyday worlds in which they live, yet even in these rounds of job, family, and neighborhood they often seem driven by forces they can neither understand nor govern. &mdash; C. Wright Mills\r\n\r\nIn 1956 sociologist C. Wright Mills\' <i>The Power Elite</i> provided an in-depth examination of power in the United States. About a decade later, in 1967, G. William Domhoff wrote <i>Who Rules America?</i> which was followed by <i>Who Rules America Now?</i> in 1983. As one might expect, these books contained a detailed analysis of who has power, how the power is exercised and through what routes the powerful came to their positions. To some degree, the who of \"who has power\" is not as relevant as <i>what</i> they do with it and <i>how</i> they came to possess it. Their routes to power were so uniform as to suggest that specific, repeatable social mechanisms were at work to ensure that the same type of person, with the same ideologies would be elevated to these positions &mdash; and that other people from other circumstances would be denied entrance. \r\n\r\nThat social mechanisms are at play is of course not news to sociologists who make it their business to understand these mechanisms. The rest of us have vague suspicions but little concrete knowledge. Although the powerful may be visible to some degree the representations that we witness in the media are likely to be sanitized, scrubbed clean of improprieties, stereotyped and otherwise rendered useless for thoughtful consideration. This knowledge is vital to all participants in a democratic society. Knowing who and how people who occupy the seats of power wield the levers of social control is key to positive social change.\r\n\r\nWhile the work of Mills and Domhoff have uncovered the processes of the maintenance of power in America, it is undoubtedly the case that similar processes are being played out every day around the world.  For that reason, it\'s imperative that these studies be undertaken throughout the world. The point of gaining an understanding of these processes is not to insert different people into the process (although in many cases this is desirable). Nor do we gain this understanding in order to derail the entire system or to just \"throw the bastards out.\" (After all, in some cases the people holding power may not be scoundrels!) An understanding of the process will help us adjust the system as necessary, know where the points of intervention exist and, in general, increase the level of awareness thus making it more difficult for the people with less power to be bamboozled by those with more. \r\n\r\nThere are many exciting examples of this pattern. One particularly compelling one is based on the Reflect theory. It combines adult learning and social change using the theories of Paulo Freire integrated with participatory methodologies. Their report on <i>Communication and Power</i> describes how written and spoken word, images and numbers can be used by villagers in India (see figure below) in analyses of caste power.', 'Research power &mdash; what it is, how is it organized and applied, who has it. Although it is important to make the findings freely available. It is at least as important to disseminate the ideas and techniques that help people initiate their own power research projects. This pattern particularly applies to government and corporations but other people, institutions, and groups (such as hate groups, militias or organized crime families) need to be thoroughly investigated as well.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2002-07-17 15:47:09', '2008-02-05 07:46:29', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Unfortunately scientists are often to serving the agendas of the world\'s most powerful institutions. The U.S. government, for example, is interested in developing the next generation of nuclear weapons, while large corporations are eager for profitable new drugs.  In other situations that require systematic thinking and scientific expertise, the job is too big for society\'s <em>professional</em> scientists; the amount of data to be collected is too vast and the need to distribute the expertise over a wide area overtaxes traditional resources.', 'Basically whenever communities need information that can help them with their goals but is unllikely to be generated through other means.

At the same time, they learn principles and how the scientific enterprise is conducted.', '<i>Citizens can help with the general scientific enterprise or with the application of scientific principles and methods that will help them deal with issues of public health or other concerns that they might have. </i>Science is too important to be left to scientists.  \r\n\r\nThis can help build society\'s store of knowledge which can help at the local (or larger) levels. Citizen science can also be used as part of a social movement and -- of course -- as a way to learn science.  There are significant advantages beyond the helping role of citizens contributing to the general knowledge store. The first advantage is that learning about science helps people become better <em>consumers</em> of science information. This skill helps people to be better prepared to analyze and, possibly,  refute scientific information that based on unfounded assumptions, that is improperly reasoned or flawed methodologically. Also, as indirect <em>funders</em> of scientific research (e.g. US taxpayers paid for the Internet\'s research and development) they would be better prepared to understand the implications of the research conducted with their tax dollars. The second advantage is that the act of actually <em>conducting</em> scientific research (especially when done collectively) helps build civic competence that can propel communities into a more proactive leadership role. \r\n\r\nSome web sites that illustrate the concept:\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/coop/index.htm\">National Weather Service Cooperative Observing Program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://birdsource.cornell.edu/cbc/\">Christmas Bird Count</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.vinsweb.org/conservation/citizenscience/index.html\">Wildlife Corridor Mapping Project</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.frogwatch.org\">FrogWatch USA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.ec.gc.ca/science/sandenov99/relate6_e.html\">Environment Canada</a> includes climate and severe weather watches; marine debris research; Treewatch, Plantwatch, Wormwatch, and Lichenwatch; a bird migration monitoring network; and even the Doo Doo Festival which has volunteers searching for sources of fecal coliform bacterial.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.globe.gov/\">GLOBE</a>  Nearly 7,000 schools around the world collect data on the atmosphere, hydrology, soil patterns, and land cover through the Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the Environment.</li></ul>\r\nAll urls and verbiage from Fall / Winter 2001-2002 <i>Wild Earth.</i>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nGeert Lovink mentioned  \"a <a href=\"http://geluidsnet.dischosting.nl/index.html\">network of sonar sensors around the Amsterdam airport</a> to measure sound pollution and noise terror of incoming and outgoing airplanes. in real time.\" (http://geluidsnet.dischosting.nl/index.html).

Without thinking about details (what else is new?) I wanted to suggest an interesting project for Seattle Community Network -- We could call it SPAM and it would stand for Seattle Public Air Monitoring.  My thought is that we\'d help install a reporting system based on cheap (?) air monitoring stations all around the city...  (Is this possible??)\r\n\r\nI\'ve been reading about various \"citizen science\" projects including nest counting, frogwatch, monitoring air pollution, checking forests in New England, etc. etc. Seems like there should be a way to combine a SPAM project with SCN (maybe Seattle Wireless?), etc. into a semi-realtime view of our polluted metropolis.</blockquote>\r\nScience Shops, another Dutch initiative, launched in the 1970s offer important background and motivation for this pattern.

Keynote address to Microsoft employees and experts on disabilities and technology, Redmond, Washington, February 19, 1998', 'Just as buildings are built with accessibility factored into their architecture from the ground up, so too must WWW and Internet architecture factor in accessibility initiatives from the outset to ensure equitable access to online resources. Accessibility standards such as the World Wide Web Consortiums Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C WAI) Guidelines offer developers guidelines for designing inclusive information infrastructures.   \r\n\r\nThe WAI guidelines provide a blueprint for ensuring that ICTs used to access them are accessible to all. They are meant to prevent digital divides from growing disproportionately to the continued use of new technologies.  By taking into account accessibility considerations, people with physical and/or learning disabilities are encouraged to become producers of information, and not just passive consumers.  This is an important point, and a distinction worth making.  It is one thing to ensure that ICTs and online media are rendered accessible for those using assistive devices (screen readers, special keyboards, mouse devices).  It is another thing entirely to ensure that people with disabilities can actively participate in creating content for the online world. A key factor of accessibility is ensuring that those with disabilities can access both the information produced for and in the electronic world, and equally as important, can also access and use the tools needed to produce this content.  \r\n\r\nHere we can return to our accessibility <I>to</I> and <I>of</I>distinction.  Accessibility <I>of</I> means making electronic information accessible according to the W3Cs WAI guidelines.  Accessibility <I>to</I> ICTs means making the tools required to produce electronic content accessible also.  These two taken together means ensuring that all people, regardless of ability, can participate equally in the production of the network society, in the information produced and broadcast via communication technologies.  Creating knowledge from this information is what defines the network society.  To our accessibility bifurcation we must add the ability to assess, to decode, and to use information, central components of what we can call digital literacy. Ensuring this knowledge benefits from all voices ensures that this network society is inclusive, representational, and reflective of the society at large.\r\n\r\n<strong>Have You Unplugged Your Mouse Today?</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat exactly does it mean to make Web content accessible?  A review of accessibility issues by various disability groups will enable us to understand the barriers faced by a significant proportion of the population.  It is useful to remember that the percentage of people with either a physical or learning disability that may impair access is around 20+% (54 million people in the US alone) (Waddell, 1999), and grows significantly according to age group. \r\n\r\nHow Many People Have Disabilities (US)? \r\n\r\nAge Group	Proportion of People with Disabilities\r\n0 -- 21		10%\r\n22 -- 44	14.9%\r\n45 -- 54	24.5%\r\n55 -- 64	36.3%\r\n65 -- 79	47.3%\r\n80+		71.5%\r\n\r\nVisual and hearing impairments are among the disabilities associated with ageing. U.S. Census Bureau  (Qtd. in Accessibility in Web Design )\r\n\r\nDisabilities that may impair access include visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive impairments. To give you an idea of what barriers these users face, here is a list of some difficulties by disability group:\r\n\r\nVision --include blind and low vision people who use screen readers to access electronic information. Items that may be inaccessible or cause difficulty for vision impaired people include: \r\n·	Some Java elements\r\n·	Browse buttons \r\n·	Poorly labeled form elements \r\n·	Inconsistencies in layout \r\n·	Inconsistencies in language \r\n·	Surprise popup windows\r\n·	Multiple frames and nested tables\r\n·	Other problems included the illogical display of steps required for task completion, and confusing and ambiguous use of terminology \r\n\r\nHearing -- hearing impaired people need closed captioning for audio so this information will not be lost to the hearing impaired. \r\n\r\nMobility -- people with mobility impairments may use screen readers, laser and infrared head mouse devices, special keyboards and other products to access online and electronic information.  They face problems similar to those encountered by the visually impaired.\r\n\r\nCognitive and Language/ Learning Disabilities -- people with these kinds of special needs use a variety of access devices to help improve access and cognition.  Difficulty with language usage, the manner in which text and links are encoded, and the use of colors, fonts, sounds, graphics, all may have an adverse impact on LD people. Other issues include:\r\n·	Inconsistencies in layout and language\r\n·	Absence of alternative formats (no redundant display of information)\r\n·	Difficulty with multi-step activities\r\n·	Confusing terminology (e.g. \"click here\")\r\n·	Complexities in page/site payout and lack of clear and consistent instructions or other navigational aids.\r\n\r\nOther factors affecting all disabled users include:\r\n·	Lack of experience with Internet/WWW technologies\r\n·	Lack of experience with assistive and adaptive technologies\r\n·	Operating system, software conflicts and difficulties\r\n·	Sites and technologies that do not support alternative access devices and strategies', '<strong>Solution:</strong>\r\n\r\nFollowing the W3C WAI guidelines is one way to ensure that all online information is accessible to persons with disabilities or to those who rely on adaptive and assistive technologies. Voluntary compliance on the part of all online providers will help the evolving standards of the WWW keep pace with the population.  However, it is imperative to seek ways to encourage the accessible design of web materials from their first iteration. Inclusive design practices must take an active role in directing the development of accessible technology.\r\n\r\nEqually as important is the need to educate all users and developers of ICTs on accessibility.  This includes focusing on the ways in which the network society -- the culture in which ICTs are embedded -- can best respond to the needs of all people.  This means looking at the social contexts in which technology sits, and examining the broader issues of access and living in a culture increasingly dominated by various mediating technologies. It means focusing less on individual accommodations and more on providing inclusive network infrastructures from the ground up.  We need to develop a cultural or environmental approach to providing accessible ICTs and online environments.  By building in electronic curbcuts from the ground up, online media and ICTs offer an inclusive opportunity for all people to participate in digital information exchange.

For some observers it only makes sense to speak in the plural sense about \"Information Societies\". For others the reference to \"society\" raises the good old sociological questions of power, profit, and participation: who controls the information society, who benefits from it, who takes part in it?

Without genuine participation in the design process, class, managerial, or other privileges become designed in. That is, sociotechnological systems often carry forward the perquisites and propensities of the designers, intentionally or unwittingly. Cases abound in both cases. Robert Moses, New York City\'s \"construction coordinator,\" ensured that the bridges over the highways leading to the beaches from New York City were low enough to prevent buses from traveling under them (Caro 1975). This ensured that African Americans and other minorities who often had to rely on public transportation would, in large measure, be confined to the city while the more financially well-to-do could periodically escape to the seaside. There was no need to pass laws when a permanent physical structure could silently and invisibly enforce the color bar Moses preferred.\r\n\r\nFrustrated by what they saw as unresponsiveness of software and the impending institutionalization of management prerogatives into software systems, Scandinavian researchers in the late 1970s conceived a new paradigm for software development called participatory design in which end-users worked as co-designers of the systems that they would ultimately use. They believed that adopting a participatory design approach would result in systems that better served users, initially workers in industrial settings. According to PD researchers Finn Kensing and  Jeanette Blomberg (1998), \"At the center of the critique was the neglect of workers interests &mdash; those most affected by the introduction of new technology. PD researchers argued that computers were becoming yet another tool of management to exercise control over the workforce and that these new technologies were not being introduced to improve working conditions (see e.g. Sandberg, 1979; Kyng and Mathiassen, 1982).  The Scandinavian researchers and workers also worked to on the legislative front to promote \"codetermination\" laws in Scandinavia that ensured that workers had the right to be involved with technological decisions in the workplace were established (Sandberg et al 1992). They promoted user empowerment through education and \"researchers developed courses, gave lectures, and supervised project work where technology and organizational issues were explored (see e.g. Kyng and Mathiassen, 1982)\" (Kensing & Blomberg 1988)\r\n\r\nParticipatory design is an integration of three interdisciplinary concerns that span research and practice: \"the politics of design; the nature of participation; and method, tools and techniques for participation\" (Kensing & Blomberg 1998). In their paper, \"Participatory Design: Issues and Concerns,\" Finn Kensing and Jeanette Blomberg discuss two primary aspects to this work: <blockquote>Increasingly, ethnographically-inspired fieldwork techniques are being integrated with more traditional PD techniques (Blomberg et al., 1996; Bødker, 1996; Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1997, Kensing et al., forthcoming). The primary techniques of ethnography include open ended (contextual) interviews and (participant) observations, often supported by audio or video recordings. These techniques are employed to gain insights into unarticulated aspects of the work and to develop shared views on the work. \r\n\r\n Complementing these tools and techniques for work analysis are those focusing on system design such as scenarios, mock-ups, simulations of the relation between work and technology, future workshops, design games, case-based prototyping,  and cooperative prototyping (Kensing, 1987; Ehn, 1989; Greenbaum and Kyng, 1991; Trigg et al., 1991; Mogensen, 1992, 1994; Blomberg et al., 1996; Grønbæk et al., 1997). These tools and techniques avoid the overly abstract representations of traditional design approaches and allow workers and designers to more easily experiment with various design possibilities in cost effective ways.</blockquote>The nature of participatory design has changed over time. In the software world, for example, the focus has shifted from the development of site-specific software systems to the design of web applications and, perhaps more importantly, to the entirety of the information and communication infrastructure, including policy development. The ideas shows up in many guises and even open source communities could be considered a type of participatory design.\r\n\r\nParticipatory design has been advocated in a number of areas besides software. Architects Lucien Kroll (1987), John Habraken (1972), Christopher Alexander (1984), Michael Pyatok (2000) and others developed a number of techniques for allowing people to design their own working and living spaces. Artist Suzi Gablick, writing in The Reenchantment of Art (1992) describes a number of ways that the creation of art could be more participatory, while many others are advocating participatory approaches to media, policy development, citizen participation journalism (Gillmor 2004). Several books, including The Design of Work Oriented Computer Artifacts (Ehn, 1988), Participatory Design: Principles and Practices (Schuler and Namioka 1993) and Design at Work (Greenbaum and Kyng) helped provide some early guides for the use of participatory design of software and the biannual Participatory Design Conference sponsored by Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility helps to foster its continued evolution. \r\n\r\nParticipatory design is not a panacea. People may not want to participate; in many cases they quite plausibly determine that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Participatory design can certainly be time-consuming and higher quality of the end product cannot be guaranteed. Participatory design projects can go awry in a number of ways (as do traditional and more orthodox software development efforts.) Software users using mental models based on the software are accustomed to using may enter a design session believing that they have already fully designed the system (down to the last key-stroke short-cut). Because of this possibility (and others reasons), many PD approaches focus on fairly general high-level exercises that are fairly far removed both conceptually and physically from computers. \r\n\r\nIn some cases, a participation trap may be said to exist. This could happen when people are being brought into an effort that will ultimately make matters worse for them. In cases like this a less cooperative, more confrontational approach may be more likely to bring satisfactory results. Participation gives rise to several issues that probably must be resolved on a case-by-case basis in practice. Potential participants understand this instinctively. If, for example, the participative arena is for show only, and no idea that originates with a participant has any chance of being adopted, people can\'t be faulted for being dubious of the process. Genuine participation should be voluntary and honest; the relevant information, rules, constraints, and roles of all stakeholders should be well-understood by all. (A person may still decide to participate even if any and all benefits would accrue to the organizers.) Ideally, the participants would be part of any decision-making, including when to meet, how to conduct the meetings, and other processes. Kensing (1983) and Clement and Van den Besselaar (1993) describe several requirements for effective PD.\r\n\r\nPD principles, techniques, and methodologies will continue to improve and be better known over time. PD will likely continue to involve bricolage, the ability of the participants and the people organizing the process to improvise. Unfortunately, as Kensing and Blomberg (1998) point out, building on the work of Clement and Van den Besselaar (1993), \"the experimental nature of most PD projects often leads to small-scale projects which are isolated from other parts of the organization.\" The best way for the process to continue to improve is to build on successes and create incrementally a culture of participation on the job and in society, that is both equitable and effective at designing systems, services, tools, and technologies whose design better meets the real demands and needs of the people.', 'There should be a strong effort to include the users of any designed system (software, information and communication systems, administrative services and processes, art, city plans, architecture, education, governance, and others) into its design process in an open, authentic, and uncoerced fashion. Participatory Design, according to Finn and Blomberg, \"has made no attempt to demarcate a category of work called cooperative, but instead has focused on developing cooperative strategies for system design PD is not defined by the type of work supported, nor by the technologies developed, but instead by a commitment to worker participation in design and an effort to rebalance the power relations between users and technical experts and between workers and managers. As such PD research has an explicit organizational and political change agenda.(See Eevi Beck\'s \"P is for Political\" (2002) for more insight on this important observation.)', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2002-09-17 11:31:57', '2008-02-18 16:19:27', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

For its reach and accessibility, microradio is a relatively cheap communications technology that can be built and utilized with widely available instructions and resources.', 'Radio was invented as a means of transmitting sounds over distances through the collective air that we all breath.  Over time, the right to transmit sound on our airwaves has been relegated to a licensing process, and over time, this licensing process has grown to aid societys rich and most priveleged in grossly disproportionate amounts.  While radio licenses to the poor, marginalized, and community groups do exist, they make up but a tiny fraction of all licenses granted.  \r\nAs media ownership limits are repeatedly stripped away by government regulatory bodies, our media resources continue to be stolen and dominated by a rich and powerful few.  The same corporate-influenced government bureacracy that makes it so hard for marginalized communities to reverse these laws of legal domination, however, can easily taken advantage of through community direct action for reclamation of the airwaves.\r\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC), bogged down by size and process, is generally very slow in its response to illegal broadcasting activity.  Typically, numerous complaints must be generated by the public, and more importantly, corporate radio engineers, before the FCC deploys field agents to take legal action against unlicensed broadcasters.  Even in the most severe bust scenarios, only one unlicensed broadcaster has ever had to pay a fine, and it was done voluntarily.  \r\nBecause these laws are rarely enforced, direct action with broad participation can instantly create a citizens band in every city- dozens of new community radio stations on the FM dial.  People citywide must construct their own micro transmitters and antennas, and broadcast to their neighborhoods with less than 10 watts of micropower.  With tens to hundreds of people broadcasting in each and every borough, the FCC bureaucracy will be severly overwhelmed, thereby exponentially reducing the risk to each individual broadcaster.\r\nFor the broadcasters who do get busted by the FCC, a wide base of community support will already be established through the neighborhood microradio network.  The FCC typically fears challenging community-supported microradio because of the bad public image they may receive- see cases of Free Radio Santa Cruz and Radio Free Brighton-Allston, who have city council support, and West Philly Pirate Radios broadcast at the liberty bell, when they publicly invited the FCC to bust them.', 'Popular direct action has historically changed social policy in societies plagued by undemocratic institutions.

An innovation can be an idea, a program, a computer, a law, or any tool to accommodate human needs.  To diffuse it, it must be meaningful in particular ways to particular people at particular times.  It may require re-invention to be adapted to different situations.', 'Any social context: a family, a work group, an organization, a neighborhood, a town.', 'The process and some things to be aware of concerning the process.  The text concerning the process comes directly from a web-page put together by E.M. Rogers concerning a Native American Library project.  \r\n\r\nAn innovation, simply put, is an idea perceived as new by the individual.   Four main elements in the diffusion of new ideas are (1) the innovation, (2) communication channels, (3) time, and (4) the social system.\r\n\r\n1. The innovation. The innovation, to spread and be adopted should show (1) relative advantage, (2) compatibility, (3) complexity, (4) trialability, and (5) observability to those people within the social system.\r\n\r\n2. Communication. Communication is the process by which participants create and share information with one another in order to reach a mutual understanding. A communication channel is the means by which messages get from one individual to another. \r\n\r\n3. Time. The time dimension is involved in diffusion in three ways. First, time is involved in the innovation-decision process. The innovation-decision process is the mental process through which an individual (or other decision-making unit) passes from first knowledge of an innovation to forming an attitude toward the innovation, to a decision to adopt or reject, to implementation of the new idea, and to confirmation of this decision. An individual seeks information at various stages in the innovation-decision process in order to decrease uncertainty about an innovation\'s expected consequences. The second way in which time is involved in diffusion is in the innovativeness of an individual or other unit of adoption. Innovativeness is the degree to which an individual or other unit of adoption is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of a social system. There are five adopter categories, or classifications of the members of a social system on the basis on their innovativeness: (1) innovators, (2) early adopters, (3) early majority, (4) late majority, and (5) laggards. \r\n\r\n4. The social system. The fourth main element in the diffusion of new ideas is the social system. A social system is defined as a set of interrelated units that are engaged in joint problem-solving to accomplish a common goal. The members or units of a social system may be individuals, informal groups, organizations, and/or subsystems. The social system constitutes a boundary within which an innovation diffuses. How the system\'s social structure affects diffusion has been studied. A second area of research involved how norms affect diffusion. Norms are the established behavior patterns for the members of a social system. A third area of research has had to do with opinion leadership, the degree to which an individual is able to influence informally other individuals\' attitudes or overt behavior in a desired way with relative frequency. A change agent is an individual who attempts to influence clients\' innovation-decisions in a direction that is deemed desirable by a change agency.\r\n\r\nProblems with this method to be aware of are 1. the innovation bias, 2. homogeneity.\r\n\r\nThe innovation bias occurs when people are mesmerized with the innovation itself and forget the social, economic, and environmental factors associated with bringing a new idea into a community.\r\n\r\nThe diffusion of innovations typically occurs within homogenuous environments.  People like what is familiar to them and often innovations might, ironically, make similarities more concrete rather than enhance diversity.', 'Include a variety of stakeholders early on in the innovation process.

Part of our task is to practice and develop the skills of civic democracy and volunteer participation.\"         - Richard Conlin, Sustainable Seattle co-founder\r\n\r\nDoctors take a patient\'s temperature to get some understanding of the person\'s general health. Although this is only one measure among hundreds or thousands of other possible measurements it is judged to be important enough &mdash; and acquired easily enough &mdash; to be warrant its acquisition. An <i>indicator</i> is typically a single measure that can be acquired over time to help ascertain the general health or condition of a larger, more complex entity, like a lake, city, or society. It helps serve by being a stand-in or proxy for that whole.\r\n\r\nIndicators are often devised and used by scientists, economists and other professionals to help inform them on the status of what\'s important to them. And just as the medical community has selected temperature as one indicator among many possibilities, these professionals have selected theirs. And, like other measurements, these can have far-reaching consequences which basically depend on they\'re interpreted, what meaning is ascribed to them, and what\'s done with them. Needless to say, communities &mdash; especially those that are struggling to stay alive &mdash; generally play no direct role in the development of these indicators, nor do they design their own. \r\n\r\nIn 1991, a group of social activists in Seattle launched an ambitious multiyear project around the idea of sustainability. Though many people today view sustainability as largely an environmental paradigm, it is one that can capture the long-term cultural, economic, civic, and educational health and vitality of a region as well. Because sustainability is a complex term and difficult to define and comprehend, the first goal was the development of a set of \"critical indicators of sustainability\" that would assist in defining the term and defining Seattles current status. \r\n\r\nSince that time the project has matured into a community-wide program divided evenly into research and community action. One commendable aspect of their effort has been the patient, evolving, consensus-driven manner in which the project has taken shape and unfolded over time without being driven by set agendas.\r\n\r\nWhen the project was launched, the \"indicators of sustainability\" were designed to form its intellectual as well as motivational foundation. Indicators are measurable values that accurately reflect and coalesce several factors that are deemed to be important. The selection of indicators as core constructs of the endeavor demonstrates the founders commitment to a long-term rather than a quick-fix effort, for it is only by examining how the values of the indicators change over time that an understanding of trends can arise. Examining changes over time may also bring to light relationships between indicators. Two indicators, for example, may actually bear inverse relationships to each other. \r\n\r\nWhen people in the community identify indicators that are important to them, the indicators are more liable to carry personal and operational meaning than when social scientists in an ivory tower identify theoretical constructs that are significant only to an academic community. The indicators are carefully chosen to reflect activity within a community that is desired or not desired by that community. Furthermore, because the community identified the indicators, there is a feeling of ownership and confidence in them.\r\n\r\nWhile Sustainable Seattles report on Seattles critical indicators presents a useful snapshot of several important aspects on the communitys agenda, it does not by itself create a sustainable society. According to their newsletter (Sustainable Seattle, 1994), \". . . understanding trends in our community is only the first step in the journey towards sustainability. The next step is to change the community.\" To that end, Sustainable Seattle initiated a Communities Outreach Project \"to create measurable improvements in the behaviors and practices that drive the indicators, both on large and small scales, as a result of homes and organizations changing their behavior in response to this project.\" Their ambitious goal \"is to enable and inspire people in the many different communities in greater Seattle to transform the values of sustainability into actions that will move Seattle, the region, and the planet towards long-term cultural, economic, and environmental health and vitality.\"\r\n\r\nThe Worldwatch Institute identified and assessed 50 social, economic, and environmental trends which they labeled the Earth\'s \"vital signs\" to help show the important role consumers can play in demanding environmentally friendly products. .Indicators can also be used in international or other large-scale collaborative projects. A new international effort between the US and Canada that monitors the health of Puget Sound Georgia Basin where salmon and orcas are endangered in Washington state and in the province of British Columbia shows another use of indicators (Stiffler, 2006).  Of the nine indicators  that the project has established five of them are declining (Urbanization and Forest Change; River, Stream and Lake Quality; Marine Species at Risk; Toxics in Harbor Seals; and Marine Water Quality) while the remaining four have not shown progress (Population Health; Solid Waste and Recycling, Shellfish; and Air Quality). Scott Redman from the US team stated that the indicator project \"puts press then for us to catch up, or the other way around.\" There is a web site that includes data as well as a large number of suggestions for people and groups who want to help improve the situation. \r\n\r\nThe Bulletin of Atomic Scientists through its \"Doomsday Clock\" offers a variant on this concept. The clock measures the state of worldwide nuclear danger (not just from a US perspective) and graphically reports its findings in a clock whose hands are approaching midnight &mdash; nuclear apocalypse. Moving the hands is not taken lightly, \"Because the Doomsday Clock is the worlds most visible symbol of nuclear danger, any decision to reset it is taken with great care and only after significant deliberation by the Bulletins board of directors, in consultation with the board of sponsors.\" It is interesting to note the infrequency within which the clock has been reset: 17 times in 56 years. The two boards reset the hands infrequently to demonstrate significant developments; the clock does not respond, \"to every change in the global security environment. If it did, it would be in almost constant motion and would lose much if not all of its symbolic resonance. \"\r\n\r\nMany of the patterns in this pattern language &mdash; including this one &mdash; could be used as indicator generators.  What indicators, for example, could  be used to show whether humankind\'s Civic Intelligence is increasing or decreasing? Virtually any area, conceptual or actual, could be a source of indicators. And in any area, it will be important to think of what possible actions could comes after the indicators are developed <i>before</i> they\'re identified. What to do with information? Who could use the information?  What resonance could the information have with various people and groups?\r\n\r\nIntroductory illustration is from <a href=\"http://www.hudsonriver.org/\">http://www.hudsonriver.org/.</a>', 'Citizens need to construct community and civic indicators, publish them, discuss them, measure them, publicize them and develop policy and projects that address them.

(538, 518, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'One of the biggest problems in contemporary life is the unchecked growth of market values as a way to govern resources and ourselves. This is resulting in the privatization and commodification  or \"enclosure\"  of the commons.  Resources that morally or legally belong to everyone are increasingly coming under the control of markets.   \r\n\r\nNot only does enclosure result in higher prices and the need to ask for permission to use something previously available to all, it shifts ownership and control to private companies.  The market efficiencies that businesses seek can be illusory, however, because they often depend upon unacknowledged subsidies from the commons (for example, discount access to public resources) and the displacement of costs onto the commons (pollution, social disruption, harm to future generations).  Enclosure does not add value in the aggregate; it merely privatizes value at the expense of the common wealth.', '\"The commons\" is a useful term for contemporary political discourse because it provides a new lexicon for re-situating market activity in a social and political context.  It helps us identify resources that should not be alienated for market use, but should remain non-propertized and \"owned\" (in a civic or democratic sense) by everyone.  Our culture has no serious vocabulary for contextualizing \"the free market\" in a social framework; it assumes that it is a universal, ahistorical force of nature.  The commons helps rectify this conceptual problem by offering a rich, countervailing template to the market paradigm, one that can speak about the economic and legal aspects of a commons as intelligibly as its social and personal aspects.', 'The commons insists that certain things should not be alienated   that is, sold and converted into money. Thus, it is inappropriate to express the value of a worker\'s life or an endangered species as a dollar sum, in a cost-benefit analysis.  It may be morally repugnant to sell off the \"naming rights\" of public institutions much as it is considered unacceptable to allow people to sell their bodies, babies, ova or genes.\r\n\r\nThe commons gives us a language for talking about extra-market values and their importance.  The commons, for example, allows us to talk about the human necessities of life  food, water, fuel, medicine  that may otherwise be seen as market commodities alone. The commons allows us to talk about the need for open, non-propertized spaces available to all; if too much of that space  for example, scientific knowledge, musical works, cultural symbols  is \"locked up\" through copyrights, patents or contracts, it can greatly impede future creativity and progress. We are already seeing the effects of such enclosure in medical research as a result of overly broad patents on \"upstream\" research.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, when information and creativity are non-propertized and non-monetized  as we see most frequently on the Internet  the resulting collaborations and exchanges generate a huge surplus value that can be enjoyed by everyone, and not be privatized. This is one reason there is such an epic struggle underway on the Internet  non-market modes of creativity and production are frequently more efficient in a strict economic sense, compared to conventional \"real world\" markets. There is a cornucopia of the commons, not a tragedy, as economists otherwise claim.\r\n\r\nDespite the different ways in which commons and market create value, the two do not necessarily operate in separate and distinct spheres, but are interdependent.  The point is to strike an appropriate <i>balance</i> between the two so that the value-creating capacities of each can be optimized.\r\n\r\nThere are a wide variety of effective commons-management models that belie the tragedy of the commons metaphor invoked by Garrett Hardin in his famous 1968 essay.  While Hardin was talking about an open access regime in which no one owns or manages a shared resource, an actual commons has specific rules and social norms for preventing over-use, excluding outsiders, and managing the resource in long-term, sustainable ways.  \r\n\r\nIncreasingly, the Internet is the host for countless self-organized commons such as free and open source software, social networking communities, Wikipedia, Craigslist, and websites for sharing photos, videos and other creative works.  One useful tool in creating these commons are Creative Commons licenses, which enable ordinary people to freely share their creative works while retaining copyrights for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nThe public library and the land trust are familiar, highly effective types of commons.  More people are starting to realize that public spaces like parks, community gardens, farmers markets and festivals are also important to the economic and social health of a community.  There is a dawning awareness that commons-based infrastructure like wireless Internet access is a great way to use a public resource, the airwaves, to help people connect with each other.\r\n\r\nThere are many other types of legal and institutional solutions for managing the commons, although most are not mentally grouped with other legal or institutional models <i>as</i> commons solutions.  It is time for more people to see the kinship of these solutions and their holistic advantages over so-called free market.', 'Using \"the commons\" as a new discourse helps us re-frame the terms of discussion for many issues and declare our personal stake in protecting shared public resources. It helps draw new linkages among disparate market enclosures, and in this sense, helps fragmented public-interest constituencies develop a new, shared language. At the same time the discourse of the commons validates a number of specific governance models -- civic institutions, stakeholder trusts, legal mechanisms, social customs and norms -- that can help us protect and manage our common assets effectively.\r\n\r\nThe emerging commons sector wont replace corporations or markets, but it will complement and temper them. In so doing, it will provide benefits corporations cant supply: healthy ecosystems, economic security, stronger communities and a participatory culture. And it will curb the corporate invasion of realms that we hold dear  nature, our minds, our food and our democracy.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2003-05-14 10:34:04', '2006-10-18 14:22:55', NULL, NULL, 'Author', NULL, 266, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

But this does not mean that questions about who is representing for whom and why and how have been resolved. Issues about legitimacy of representation remain crucial, and indeed I shall argue that how  to articulate and represent the everyday is the main issue in the politics of culture.\" - David Chaney (2002)</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNon-whites, convicts, the poor, sick, starving people, flood victims, uneducated, aged, rural as well as intellectuals, dissidents, gender, ethnic and other marginalized groups are often the victim of mis-representation. Their presentations are often paper-thin, stereotypical at best. (While mention of other people are simply omitted; they don\'t exist.)  The net result is a compelling, free-floating image of \"normalcy\" that serves as a model to be emulated.\r\n\r\nThis pattern represents a concept that gets very little notice. After all, there is really no way to fully control your representation or what people do with it. Ultimately its an expression of power: Who is creating the representations, under what conditions, and how can they be maintained, changed, or challenged? When somebody else is determining how you will be represented you have been robbed of your right to defend yourself, to make your own case for who you are. On some level, it\'s a type of identity theft. Who you are has been determined elsewhere and stamped on you. \r\n\r\nWhy bother with representations? Is there really anything to worry about? Are there any negative implications? Yes. For one thing, there seems to be substantial evidence that people start believeing their own representations &mdash; and act according to them. Representations, unfortunately, can have exceedingly long life spans since culture tends to replicate itself. Also people individually see little reason to change the way they view the world unless there is a compelling reason to rethink themselves. \r\n\r\nThis pattern on the one hand depicts the need for people everywhere to grab hold of their own representation and challenge the mechanisms (generally of media production) that perpetuates the stereotypes. At this level of analysis the pattern recommends a more accurate and bi-directional approach to \"representation\" &mdash; often of entire countries, ethnic and other marginalized populations.  At a deeper level this pattern seeks to remedy a problem much more insidious -- that of a steady colonization from \"within.\" \r\n\r\nThe importance of this pattern is obvious. It\'s why people may be suspicious when others are talking about them. It\'s why big corporations and political parties spend enormous sums on <I>public relations</I> and \"spinning\" news and other information to their advantage. Corporations and government agencies have elaborate  and professional strategies for ensuring that their public portrait is painted according to their specifications. Movies stars, writers, etc. have their own publicists whose job it is to bring (or <i>push</i>) certain information to certain people. On the other hand, powerful people and institutions also go to great lengths to keep some information submerged and hidden forever. \r\n\r\nThere are several tools for addressing these problems. People in the group who may be perpetrating the stereotypes &mdash; white males (like me) for example &mdash; have the responsibility to acknowledge these transgressions and strive to overcome them. Media literacy and media critique are two skills worth developing and media monitoring is a worthwhile way to develop a fact base that can be used to confront the mis-representers. Much of this work should be done at a community level: the analyses should be shared, for example, with the community because it\'s often the community that is being mis-represented. Also, as was alluded to earlier, it may even be possible that members of the mis-represented community may be unconsciously living down to the stereotypes of their community. \r\n\r\nMedia is essentially a one-way street, a mute, wall-to-wall hallucinatory enclosure.  (Although people do interpret according to their own rules that the media doesn\'t necessarily control.) The \"message\" of this medium is rarely acknowledged &mdash; it is truly the fabled 800-pound gorilla.  Like a voice in your head, its message is compelling and persistent.  <I>It won\'t go away!</I> It sows indecision while removing individual autonomy and opportunities for authentic social learning. Yet media producers aren\'t necessarily evil.  Often laziness, lack of imagination (cloning the popular movie), and financial decisions factor in.', 'The first step to addressing  this problem is to acknowledge that it exists. Since the media (and cultural representations generally) are so ubiquitous that it\'s hard to believe that there is a bias, however implicit. The second obstacle is thinking that nothing can be done about this. As you dig deeper in this you may simultaneously be amazed at the extent of the problem and your desire to help overcome it.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2003-05-14 12:29:28', '2007-03-18 15:37:53', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(541, 521, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'Repression and other forms of injustice and other social ills are often overlooked, dismissed in a cursory way, or deemed to be inevitable and immutable.  Even when these problems are acknowledged, resistance to them is shallow, erratic, uncoordinated and ineffectual. Although art can be used to deliver a message of inspiration and information for the disempowered, it is often irrelevant; it can be a tool of the powerful and a diversion of the wealthy. In many cases, a distracting and ubiquitous corporate media has replaced the tradition of people and communities telling their own stories.', 'People and societies around the world have over the years developed their own versions of hell on earth that some subset of its inhabitants is obliged to endure. These regions exist within all societies, but vary in size and in magnitude of abuse ranging from neglect to active repression.', 'Artists occupy a unique role in society.  Through a diversity of approaches, they explore new terrains that words alone are incapable of describing. Art can address issues, help solve problems and even serve as a \"public psychiatrist\" that surfaces social anxieties.  Art speaks to places that other languages can\'t and affects consciousness on a level that we don\'t understand and can\'t map. Some, but not all, artists work for social and environmental justice. Notably artists can explore ideas of personal or societal importance or they can operate within a world circumscribed by religious authorities, corporations or the art-buying public, a decidedly privileged class economically. \r\n\r\nThe \"world\" that \"resistance\" strives to understand and confront provides an exhaustible fount of inspiration for artists &#150; professionals and non-professionals alike.  The media through which messages and stories can be conveyed includes T-shirts (indeed, wearing the wrong t-shirt is an invitation to harassment, fines, and imprisonment in my regions and countries around the world) and comics and zines, opera, ballet, graffiti, murals, sculpture, film, film or many other approaches.  Art can be immersive and engaging; it can help build community and involve the \"audience\" in rituals or processions. Art can be an invidual or collective effort, big or small, public or anonymous, clandestine and furtive,  In can be created by children or by people or emotionally disturbed. The art of homeless people, refugees, or incarcerated people is likely to present a view of the world that the rest of us may not see. \r\n\r\nResistance art brings hidden knowledge out of the shadows. The historic roots of contemporary experience, a common theme of Chicano murals, such as those created by Los Cybrids collective, in Los Angeles and other southwestern cities in the US explore themes of identity and hybridity. Another approach is to present the reality of a situation in a documentary style, such as Walker Evans\' sparse, unadorned depression era photographs of the rural poor. Another approach is exemplified by George Grosz\'s grotesque and piercing caricatures of militarists and war-profiteers, or Hitler garbed in a bearskin. \r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, Artists of the World Against Apartheid based in France issued a broad appeal to artists around the world to contribute anti-apartheid works of art. Ernest Pignon-Ernest of France and Antonio Saura of Spain worked unselfishly for two years to make it happen. A major exhibition was mounted in late 1983 at the Fondation Nationale des Arts Graphiques et Plastiques in Paris. Since the organizers had stipulated in advance that the art would be held in trust and given to the people of South Africa on the occasion of \"the first free and democratic government by universal suffrage\" as the basis of an anti-apartheid museum, the collection was moved to South Africa at the request of president Nelson Mandela.\r\n\r\nA similar event took place in the U.S. two decades later. With the invasion of Iraq looming, first lady Laura Bush, picked an inopportune time to invite poet Sam Hamill to a special White House event, \"Poetry and the American Voice,\" which was to celebrate the works of Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman and Langston Hughes. Instead of being seduced by to the allure of power and prestige, Hamill refused Bush\'s invitation.  Instead he emailed several friends asking them for poems on the theme of war which would be bound and presented to Bush. This ignited a poetic firestorm that claimed no national border. Inspired by Hamill\'s defiance, a web site (http://www.poetsagainstthewar.org) was established that provided a platform for poets around the world to express their feelings related to the impending war.  The site proved immediately and enormously popular &#150; at its peak it was averaging several new poems a minute.  Now the site has over 20,000 poems online &#150; including works by Adrienne Rich, W.S. Merwin. and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and spotlights several poems per week.  The project ultimately published two volumes of poetry and an excellent documentary film, \"Poets in Wartime,\" was inspired by the effort. Moreover, the work engendered a non-profit organization, \"Poets Against War\", was formed with the simple yet direct mission statement: \"Poets Against War continues the tradition of socially engaged poetry by creating venues for poetry as a voice against war, tyranny and oppression.\" \r\n\r\nThis episode (Poets Against War) raises the general question of the role of occupational groups and whether there is an implicit or explicit obligation to help deter aggression and war.  A short list of such candidates would include teachers, religious leaders, engineers, journalists, farmers, and doctors and nurses and other caregivers. A longer list would include almost everybody &#150; for very few people in the world actually want to be within war\'s lethal compass, as either participant or as innocent bystander. \r\n\r\nAnother fascinating example, is the beehive design collective, an amazing anarchic and itinerant design collective that, although home-based in Vermont, travels around the world to create region-specific murals. Members often work with indigenous or other people to develop murals that capture the unique circumstances of the people who live there. The murals they develop grow organically; containing a variety of elements sinuously weaving indigenous plans and animals, historic referents, and symbols of corporate and colonial domination, with images of fanciful and realistic resistance.\r\n\r\nResistance art has many audiences. In the anti-apartheid movement, for example, the audience would obviously include the victims of apartheid and the supporters of their struggle.  It would also include the people who believe themselves neutral of hadn\'t thought about apartheid from a moral standpoint and people who were actively promulgating it: politicians, policemen, the media, and business spokespeople who benefited from the cheap labor provided by the marginalized victims. Beyond that, the audience extended to the rest of the world.  Many people outside of South Africa worked on anti-apartheid campaigns.  Gill Scott-Heron\'s anti-apartheid anthem, \"Johannesburg,\" was played on the radio in US cities, where its uncomfortable references to big segregated cities in the US like New York and Philadelphia showed that South Africa was not the only country in the world where prejudice and racism flourished. \r\n\r\nFrom Goya and Picasso to Johannesburg\'s T-shirt artists of and anonymous graffiti artists around the world, resistance artists, generally acting  on their own &#150; have portrayed the horrors of war or other abominations. Activists in Seattle, hoping to help cultivate a supportive community network for resistance artists convened two Arts of Resistance conferences.  Through workshops, presentations, videos, and, most importantly, through face-to-face dialogue and debate, the idea that art can be socially transformative became more widely recognized and more thoughtfully practiced. \r\n\r\nPeople ultimately also need to be reminded of two things &#150; that they are not impotent and disconnected spectators but active and engaged participants in the ongoing vibrant fabric of life. Art, therefore, can tell the story of the ongoing struggle while suggesting  ways for people to take part.

As power and wealth become more concentrated, wealthy people and institutions become more and more dominant in the policy arena. When that happens, local and marginalized voices are not heard; people feel disempowered and disengage further from the political process. \"Ordinary\" people generally stay far from the public policy arena. They feel isolated and are unaware that others are striving towards positive change. When there are public policy successes, they\'re not often shared with other communities and the people at the grassroots who enter the public policy arena often must needlessly reinvent the wheel.', 'As our lifeworld becomes more and more complex governance also grows more complicated. Meanwhile the need for sound policy becomes more essential. There are opportunities for grassroots political engagement for every policy issue that is at stake. Increasingly this will involve the intelligent use of new media and the Internet. Moreover, in this context, the development of the Internet &mdash; and policies regarding citizen use of and oversight of ICT in general &mdash; make these a critical areas in themselves for grassroots public policy development.', 'Public policy determines whether a new library is built &mdash; and <i>where</i> &mdash; and how a new clinic for homeless people is funded &mdash; or <i>not.</i> It even determines to a large degree who has access to communication services and who has the right to control them. Although it is often \"public policy\" which silently promotes or discourages certain public actions, the development, maintenance, use, and, often, the very existence of the \"public policy\" is about as far from \"public\" as can be imagined. \r\n\r\nPolicy is governance. It helps address questions like, How will we live together in a complex society? How will we deal with the problems of our time and how we collectively define what those problems are? Will governance be <i>of the people, by the people, for the people?</i> or will it succumb to the defects resulting from a concentration of power and wealth? This pattern is closely related to Power Research because the information uncovered is likely to be useful in determining how policy is developed and what alternative practices may be effective for developing alternative policies from the grassroots. \r\n\r\nPublic policy often has a technocratic air about it. It\'s often constructed by \"wonks\" just as computer code is produced by \"geeks\" and both geeks and wonks are stereotypically portrayed as social misfits who prefer complicated and artificial arcana to the \"real world\" (of flesh, blood, emotions, etc.). But while it\'s true that policy development (like computer development) does have its degree of inherent complexity (especially as it assumes a final form), an important part of its development is not \"geeky\" at all: it involves the crucial task of determining what one would like to see in society and how it might be encouraged to happen. \r\n\r\nGrassroots public policy development involves local engagement that is generally contrary to top-down approaches. It occurs when the problem and the solution are defined by the active local parties rather than imposed from outside. Jason Corburn (2005) discusses why people &mdash; especially non-professionals working in the local community &mdash; are unlikely to get involved in policy work. <blockquote> \"one difficulty that local knowledge presents is that is insights are often very contextual, while policy-making tends to make general rules. Much of the work on local knowledge is ethnographic and deeply conceptual, and few general patterns or lessons are offered. Advocates of local knowledge have been understandably hesitant to \"scale up\" or generalize their findings and insights &mdash; largely out of fear of inaccurate decontextualizations, oversimplifications and unjustified generalizations.\" </blockquote>Corburn goes on to point out that it isn\'t just local communities who lose out when they\'re excluded from the process. Society at large suffers as well as, interestingly enough, the policy \"wonks\" whose job it is to develop these policies. <blockquote>\"professional decision makers have not found ways to incorporate the important understandings from studies of local knowledge into the more generalized practice of policymaking. Scaling up knowledge from local settings is a necessary task in environmental health because of the extreme heterogeneity in ecosystems and human-environment linkages. But local knowledge can be used to improve environmental-health decisions while maintaining a heightened sensitivity to the contextually specific qualities of this knowledge.\" </blockquote>The W. K. Kellogg Foundation lists four types of public policy (Kellogg Foundation, 2006): statutory (including constitution / charter or laws), fiscal (including annual budgets, acts and resolutions), regulatory (administrative rules), and institutional (such as policy manual and standards, and tenure and appointment). For each public policy type, they describe broad characteristics including scope, applicability, duration, process characteristics and primary policy makers. Note that different jurisdictions will have different public policies and each contains a variety of types. Nevertheless, the public policy landscape of any given jurisdiction can be described and understood with some variation using this framework. Using the typology described above as a way to focus one\'s learning in the public policy arena &mdash; especially as it pertains to one\'s own area of interest &mdash; is usefull for focusing public policy engagement. \r\n\r\nOnce the type of policy to be developed has been established along with at least a rough form for the policy, the plan for implementing the policy should be developed. The process must be considered, including both the formal or legal aspects of the process and the informal, tacit and behind-the-scenes aspects of the process, especially in conjunction with a consideration of the primary policy makers and how they generally operate. \r\n\r\nThe <i>Children\'s Partnership</i> offers \"Six Essential Elements Derived from The Children\'s Partnership\'s Experiences\" that show the basic steps in a process of moving \"from an idea to a successful public policy.\" \r\n\r\n1. RESEARCH BASE that is grounded in what local communities want and need.\r\n2. POLICY PROPOSAL that responds to findings from research &mdash; one that is saleable and scaleable.\r\n3. WAYS TO COMMUNICATE the policy idea effectively.\r\n4. DEMONSTRATION that the policy idea can work in the real world.\r\n5. ORGANIZING / ADVOCACY for the idea &mdash; using strategic partnerships\r\n6. FOLLOW THROUGH TO IMPLEMENTATION of the new policy.\r\n\r\nThe inherent problem of people approaching similar problems from diverse perspectives (and, hence, using different vocabularies) will continue to crop up. People working on similar problems may not find each other or be aware of their respective efforts and intentions. Other questions also need to be addressed: who gets to do what, whose ideas are taken into account, what attitudes (respectful, paternalistic, domineering) prevail, in whose name or on what basis decisions are made, and whether they are enforced or neglected. \r\n\r\nPeople often do not know how to get involved and have limited experience with being effectively involved. They therefore require contexts or channels to guide their participation and an invitation to join the effort. There are numerous sociological and psychological dimensions at play here and people will need to advance in their individual development within this social exercise. \r\n\r\nAlthough face-to-face encounters remain important, tools of the Internet era can be used to facilitate new modes of organizing. For one thing, people can allow for more open spaces for dialogue and engagement. It may also be possible to coordinate with other communities who are involved in similar activities. The Internet can promote the idea of moving decision-making power towards smaller local assemblies while maintaining flexibility and freedom to connect local assemblies. In other words, new online media can allow people and communities to organize more effectively around these principles and values. \r\n\r\nNote also that although some action, procedure or decision might be properly enshrined as part of public policy, it may have very little bearing on how things are actually done. In other words, public policy is only as valid to the degree that it is enforced and/or respected and abided by. The use of this pattern is probably only reasonable to the extent that public policy is actually respected in the setting in which it is intended to be used. For that reason, the reality of the policy\'s actual deployment in society, in addition to any other relevant circumstances surrounding the development and use of the policy, needs to be given special consideration.', 'Public policy should genuinely reflect accumulated public wisdom.

If such experiences accumulate, then the familiar trend might conceivably be reversed and affluence become assoiciated with deceleration.\" &mdash; Wolfgang Sachs, Reinhard Loske, and Manfred Linz, <em>Greening the North</em></blockquote> This pattern is about escape, liberation, disengagement &mdash; and, <i>necessarily,</i> re-engagement. Neither the name nor its discussion adequately reflects its enormity.\r\n\r\nThis pattern applies equally to brief escapes from the clutches of mass-media (ever striving to <i>grab</i> our <i>attention</i>), the tyranny of the schedule and the clock (that <i>programs people</i> into vast assembly lines) and to the other habits of thought and action that have been hammered pitilessly into our psyches. \r\n\r\nBoth an instant of freedom and a year of freedom, of disconnection from forces that are essentially inhuman and unnatural are covered by this pattern.  What is not sanctioned by this pattern is <I>permanent</I> retreat.  This pattern, the last in our pattern language sequence is intended to help people get in touch with their own feelings, with a different pace, with a reality that isnt mediated by mass media or by other distractions.  Its intended to help people <i>disengage, recharge</i> and to <i>re-engage</i> in ways that are more lively, more creative, more caring and more wise.\r\n\r\nOur species is millions of years old and the universe we inhabit is incomprehensibly vaster in size and in age.  The rhythms of our universe, the seasons of the earth and our body likewise seem timeless, they exist still, within what John Trudell calls our \"genetic memory.\" The rhythms of timeless life are not the same as those of television, the Internet, the workaday world.\r\n\r\nThe practice of cramming tasks into specific, discrete slots of time makes the declaration that the task <i>will</i> take that much time even when a slot with more or less time may be the right amount for the job.  Educating people for example, as teachers know, isnt done best in an assembly line fashion.  Some students need more time, some less, and, or course, the type of lesson etc. should vary as well.\r\n\r\nWhen life is routinized, when all of one\'s actions are circumscribed by external events and canned responses, internalized clichés, the ability to change direction and to pursue a different path is minimized. A retreat, a <i>break</i> in the process is necessary; for it is during those times &mdash; however brief &mdash; when this change can occur. \r\n\r\nThe digital realm, for social (as well as structural) reasons, has helped promote a culture where answers or solutions exist.  The Internet is good for finding facts, (what Centerville in the U.S. has the largest populations?  Centerville, Iowa.) but cant teach analysis, interpretation, critique, or, even common sense.  Reality even when addressed artificially through computer simulations (a <i>proper use</i> of computer when its limitations are sufficiently appreciated) must cope with numerous <i>levels</i> of complexity and interaction.\r\n\r\nThe (post-?) modern world of the Internet, mass media, \"virtual reality,\" globalization, spectacle, empty abstractions, and real-time data, on the one hand, and SUVs, AIDS, homeless children picking through garbage for food, landless peasants, mega mansions and mega-slums, on the other hand, are both \"real.\"  They both exist as perceptable information that exists in our individual and collective minds, which, even if intangible, has tangible implications.  Our thoughts, ideas, and memories, no matter how incoherent, paranoid or illogical, play themselves out the \"real world:\" \r\n\r\nThe wilderness or other setting relatively unperturbed by humankind is probably the best setting for the practice of this pattern: \"Alone in the forest, time is less \'dense,\' less filled with information; space is very \'close\'; smell and hearing and touch reassert themselves.  It is keenly sensual. In a true wilderness we are like that much of the time, even in broad daylight. Alert, careful, literally \'full of care.\' Not because of principles or practice, but because of something very old\" (Turner, 1989). \r\n\r\nThe function of this pattern language is to acknowledge and celebrate seeds of life that can be used to generate more life in the face of violence and corruption.  Remaining pure or removed, aloof from the sordidness of the world that has developed over the centuries, is not an option.  Nor is it necessarily more admirable than retreating into the vast media wastelands, work, mysticism, sports, or drugs. Engagement and retreat together form an eternal cycle that we ignore at our own peril.', 'People need to set up times to think, to step back and to recharge their batteries. After this respite, one is more likely to be happy, committed, and ready to re-engage once again. Retreat and reflection are necessary counterparts to engagement and both are necessary in the \"fierce struggle to create a better world.\"', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2003-05-14 14:53:52', '2007-03-18 13:12:24', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(563, 543, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'By acting as though the future will never arrive and things never change, we are subconsciously creating the future with the seeds that we are unwittingly sowing today. Whether by actively embracing the conventional \"wisdom\" that has created these socially and environmentally precarious  times or by succumbing to the dictates of habit, instinct or necessity, humankind seems to sleepwalking into the future. Indeed it is quite plausible that we are creating the ideal conditions today for unspeakable disasters tomorrow.', 'This pattern can be used in a million situations, especially when people feel strongly that the directions they\'re following aren\'t the directions that they think they ought to be following. Employing this pattern often takes the form of a collaborative envisioning exercise with a variety of stakeholders.', 'Looking at the future with open, imaginative and critical eyes can open up the possibility of &mdash; <i>if not the demand for</i> &mdash; fundamental social change. After all, why would anybody bother to contemplate the future if there were no possibility of change; if every step taken was an echo of some past step. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this pattern is to get people actively engaged envisioning better futures and making plans on how to get there. Through \"rehearsing for the future\" we hope to create a wealth of possible scenarios that could become the positive \"self-fulfilling prophecies\" of tomorrow, rather than the violent and exploitive scenarios that seem to rule today. \r\n\r\nEducational settings are not the only setting for introducing and advancing a rich future-oriented agenda but they may be the best. Unfortunately, however, current educational practices seem to be oblivious to the future. Schools present topics such as mathematics or science with no historical context. History, on the other hand, though based on human events, becomes an \"authoritative\" recounting of past facts while the future is a \"mere abstraction\" (Slaughter & Beare, 1993). And since everything seemingly and inexorably unfolded in an <I>inevitable</I> way, the sequence of human events appears largely unalterable. \r\n\r\nOne failing of a non futures-oriented educational approach is the lack of inquiry into the causes of the world\'s problems (Slaughter & Beare, 1993). Nor is there any effort to develop or consider that could help alleviate these problems. Beyond a cursory look at history, where the impact of people who aren\'t elites is never evident, many people worldwide live in an eternal <i>now</i>, a temporal cocoon which cultivates amnesia of the past and ill preparedness for the future.  Both elites and \"ordinary people\" seem unwilling to acknowledge that they have roles in shaping the future. Forgetting that fact in the face of immense 21st Century challenges strips humankind of its fundamental capacity to consciously make plans (Slaughter & Beare, 1993).\r\n\r\nFuture Design helps surface the internal models of the future that have been ignored, repressed, or deliberately kept from view, and attempts to understand how they play out and how they came to be. At the same time, and somewhat independently, Future Design builds new models that help liberate us from dangerous inertia and help us be more effective in our thinking about and acting on the future.\r\n\r\nThere is an endless variety of exercises, games, workshops, and other activities that we are calling \"Future Design.\" Many of these could be organized and convened in just about any setting. Lori Blewett and Doug Schuler recently used a \"Design a Society\" workshop to organize a large team project in our \"Global Citizenship\" program at The Evergreen State College. Schools, of course, should not be the only place where Future Design can be pursued. Future Design activities are needed that could be done individually (and, hopefully, shared), on the job (government, NGOs, business, etc.), with activists, and as broad-based, possibly phased, longer-termed projects &mdash; with or without government involvement and support. \r\n\r\nThe current project, Open Space Seattle 2100 to develop a \"comprehensive open space network vision for Seattle\'s next 100 years\" contains elements (including the need for participants and resources &mdash; even if it\'s just time) that could be considered typical of Future Design activities.  Since the Seattle plan is ambitious it requires broad support and ample resources. The University of Washington and the City of Seattle are key players as are a variety of environmental, civic, neighborhood, professional and other groups. Many of the Future Design projects that have civic goals are participatory and inclusive. At the same time that the community is developing a collective vision, the organizers also aim \"To catalyze a long-term advocacy coalition and planning process for Seattle\'s integrated open space.\"\r\n\r\nThe Seattle project consciously invokes the visionary park and landscape work of the Olmstead brothers in the early 1990\'s that contributed to Seattle\'s livability. The timeline for this project which is longer than standard planning horizons, frees participants from a variety of constraints on their thinking. By encouraging people to think beyond what\'s considerable immediately do-able people are more likely to be creative. On the other hand, if the timeframe is too far in the future participants are likely to feel detached from the enterprise. The Seattle project gets around this by including tasks for the short-term as well as visions  for the long-term. \r\n\r\nIn order to strike a balance between the real and the imagined, designers of Future Design projects must provide a structure for less-structured activities to take place within. The projects must provide prompts &mdash; scenarios, instructions, props, etc. &mdash; that encourage people to imagine a future without forcing them down certain paths. Since people can\'t simply be instructed to \"be creative,\" these \"prompts\" are used to promote futures thinking among the participants. This pattern can be used in many settings, but research has shown that Future Design needs a supportive atmosphere, and, as Open Space Technology literature suggests, participants need to participate with passion, commitment and an open-mind.  A broad spectrum of community groups needs to be represented, or at least recognised, or the outcome can reaffirm prejudices and help perpetuate old conflicts. \r\n\r\nFuture Design processes often provide a variety of participatory opportunities. The 7-10 person teams that addressed open space issues in one of the neighborhoods outlined on the Seattle Charrette Map (see image at end of this pattern) are key to the effort but organizers have organized a lecture series and a blog (http://open2100.blogspot.com) to encourage alternative ways to participate. \r\n\r\nMassive challenges await this vain undertaking at every turn. How effective is Future Design? How do games and other Future Design approaches translate into <i>action</i> How do future designers from one group build on the results of others?  Interestingly a project whose recommendations aren\'t  implemented can still be a success.  Margaret Keck describes the \"Solucao Integrada\" (Integrated Solution), a plan for sewage treatment and environmental restoration in Brazil, which, although shelved by the government, lived on in the public\'s eye as an example of sensible large-scale solution in the face of other ill-conceived projects. \"Success\" must be judged in a variety of ways and this includes inclusivity and richness of the Future Design process, its immediate impacts and its indirect contributions to the overall imagination and civic culture of a community. \r\n\r\nFinally, as John Perry Barlow\'s email tagline reminds us: \"Man plans, God laughs.\" Human history is full of twists, enlightened and macabre, tragic and heroic. The future is unlikely to come out the way we think it will or want it to, but that shouldn\'t prevent us from trying to work towards the goal of a more just and healthy future. \r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"-1\">Graphics\r\nTop: <a href=\"http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/258280_openspace04.html\">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a> (http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/258280_openspace04.html)\r\nBottom: <a href=\"http://www.open2100.org\">Open Space Seatlte 2100</a> (http://www.open2100.org)</font>', 'Develop participatory activities that addrdess these four major objectives: (1) Develop visions of the future and ideas about how to achieve them; (2) Bring into the light and critically analyze the current models of the future that people, society and institutions are employing both explicitly and implicitly; (3) Help instill feelings of empowerment, compassion, hope and courage in futures thinking and action; and (4) At the same time, cultivate humility in regards to the unknowability of the future and the limits to human reason and understanding.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2003-05-14 14:56:53', '2006-04-06 13:40:19', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Beyond the losses incurred thus far, there is evidence that the trend is increasing as languages such as English, Spanish, and Swahili are displacing languages that are less prominent in the world media and language sphere. Losing humankind\'s linguistic diversity diminishes our collective ability to perceive and think about the world in a holistic, multi-faceted and rich way.', 'Everybody who communicates with other people employs language. To a large extent, the language that we use places constraints on what -- and <em>how</em> -- we think. Everybody has a stake in promoting linguistic diversity although some people are better positioned to help.', 'In 1992, Michael Krauss, a language professor at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, predicted that half of the world\'s languages would become extinct within the next century. Although languages periodically have become extinct throughout history, the frequency of language death today is unprecedented. Krauss reported that of the 20 tongues still known to the state\'s indigenous people, only two of were being taught to children. A 1990 survey in Australia, cited in a article by W. Wayt Gibbs, \"found that 70 of the 90 surviving Aboriginal languages were no longer used regularly by all age groups. The same was true for all but 20 of the 175 Native American languages spoken or remembered in the U.S.\" The \"ethnologue\", an Internet resource that lists over 7,000 languages currently in use worldwide, contains over 400 languages which are thought to be in imminent danger of extinction.\r\n\r\nIt may be that our everyday familiarity with language prevents us from respecting the fact that \"...any language is a supreme achievement of a uniquely human collective genius, as divine and endless a mystery as a living organism,\" as Krauss reminds us. Linguistic diversity can be thought as analogous to biological diversity. In that vein, Krauss asks his readers, \"Should we mourn the loss of Eyak or Ubykh any less than the loss of the panda or California condor?\"\r\n\r\nMany of the imperiled languages are those of indigenous people. Unfortunately for the rest of us, the world-views of indigenous people, especially in relationship to the environment, is one of the vantage points we can\'t afford to lose. David Crystal, writing in Language Death, states that, \"Most westerners are infants in their knowledge of the environment, and how to behave towards it, compared with the indigenous peoples, for whom the environment is part of the business of survival.\" It\'s a sobering thought to ponder how much mass media may be determining what\'s in our \"environment\" and, hence, in our \"knowledge of the environment.\" Is it true that American teenagers have 63 words for shopping?\r\n\r\nLinguists are now employing a variety of techniques to document the world\'s endangered languages before they are lost forever.  This usually involves field work in which a dictionary and grammar guide are produced.  Often recordings are made of native speakers. But looking beyond the last-ditch \"capture\" of a language before it dies forever. a variety of techniques are being used to try to build back a viable language community.  A program devised by Leanne Hinton acquired funding to pay both fluent indigenous speakers and younger learners. \r\n\r\nWhat else can be done? David Crystal lists six factors that he believes can help resusitate an endangered language. An endangered language will progress if its speakers: <ol><li>increase their prestige within the dominant community</li><li> increase their wealth relative to the dominant community</li><li> increase their legitimate power in the eyes of the dominant community</li><li>have a strong presence in the educational system</li><li>can write their language down</li><li>can make use of electronic technology</li></ol>\r\nHans-Jurgen Sasse believes that \"collective doubts about the usefullness of language loyalty\" among the speakers of a language can presage its demise. The speakers themselves can of course strive to maintain their language.  The world outside of that language community can play a role by respecting linguistic diversity, often by dropping prejudices and a bias for monolingualism. David Crystal believes that this bias is, at least to some degree, a product of colonialism, that is now being promoted by economics. When bilingualism flourishes, speakers can participate in the world beyond their language community intellectually and commercially while maintaining their own community, identity and  heritage. \r\n\r\nAs with other thorny problems, no single answer exists. Solutions that work in some places have no effects in others. Education of one sort or another will play a large role in language maintenance; the language must be passed on from older to younger generations.  Artistic and other forms of cultural expression can serve as an outlet for creative impulses that can also be enjoyed by the world beyond their community. \r\n\r\n<font size=\"-1\">Introductory graphic, \"Endangered Languages of North America,\" is from the web site, http://www.si.edu/i+d/lang.big.html</font>', 'Due to their particular knowledge and expertise, linguists are often at the forefront of the struggle for linguistic diversity.

Not all people have access to information and ideas from which they might benefit, and the proliferation of ideas does not guarantee that people will encounter them. Information does not always want to be free.', 'Public libraries have a history of successful struggle against the obstacles to the access to information and ideas. Among the findings of a recent research report in the US, they remain trusted and valued by the public, even though funding is becoming increasingly difficult. Public libraries are increasingly becoming a community space; while demand for traditional library services remains strong, public libraries are widely perceived as offering solutions to community problems and they have the potential to do more in future (Public Agenda, 2006).', 'More than 150 years ago, public libraries started to provide people with information and knowledge that would otherwise have been out of reach. Through a publicly-funded lender, ordinary people such as Samuel Johnsons common reader could discover more and better books. At a library open to all, any ambitious working-class youth could seek self-improvement; Andrew Carnegie, future benefactor of public libraries around the world, educated himself as a young immigrant only through the kindness of the owner of a private library. \r\n\r\nBroad public support for the sober and egalitarian institution of the public library allows citizens to encounter difficult, provocative and unpopular ideas. Public libraries embody both the characteristics of their communities and the principles of intellectual freedom. More of one may lead to less of the other. The challenge of liberating libraries is to benefit from the justified pride that communities take in their public libraries while encouraging greater efforts toward intellectual freedom.\r\n\r\nArticle 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares the right of intellectual freedom: to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. This freedom of opinion and expression for all citizens underlies a societys capacity to recognize and realize new possibilities. Civic participation requires access to information and life-long education. Prosperity in a free society depends upon the creativity which comes from diverse and challenging ideas. Democracy\'s survival over time calls for adaptability and critical thought in the face of change.\r\n\r\nThrough professional associations such as the American Libraries Association (ALA) and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA), librarians advocate the principles of intellectual freedom. The pressures that they experience tell us about the obstacles to these principles. Among these obstacles are money, location, coercion, private interests, lack of privacy, and pressure toward conformity.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries provide services regardless of the ability to pay; they serve everyone equally, including those for whom money would otherwise present an obstacle. Though the public library may enjoy broad public approval, funding for this free and open source of information is seldom easily come by. \r\n\r\nPublic libraries provide services regardless of location. Whether in inner cities or remote rural outposts, they reach people who might otherwise not encounter the information and ideas that libraries offer.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries provide services regardless of coercion and censorship. They exist to bring people and ideas together, not to separate them. Public libraries operate at arms length from their sponsors, whether government, taxpayers, volunteer fundraisers (such as Friends groups) or private donors. Despite this, they often struggle with the restriction of information by governments, by self-censorship among librarians, and by those who seek to impose their standards or tastes on others.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries provide services independently of private interests. While respecting intellectual property, public libraries give priority to their patrons over commercial concerns, advocates of particular views, and any other interests which may distort the free flow of information and ideas.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries protect the privacy of their patrons. They encourage people to access information and ideas by maintaining the confidentiality of what they look for, look at, and communicate.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries resist pressures toward conformity which arise even where the diversity of information and ideas is growing.  They take pride in providing ideas and information which are unorthodox, unpopular, or considered dangerous by the majority (American Library Association, 2004).\r\n\r\nAs an information commons (Kranich, 2004, p. 281), the public library provides a forum for information and ideas, it offers new ways to access information, and it recognizes freedom of opinion and expression as the basis of democratic society. Though its strategies and services go beyond the printed word and beyond the walls of the library building, the public library also offers those who love that magical hinged object, the book (Holroyd, 1999, p. 143) a refuge from the possibly less subversive distractions of technology and contemporary media.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries develop access to information in many ways. Individual libraries provide computer access and guidance to patrons, including those who have no other means of using the Internet. Regional aggregation of library catalogs and databases offers patrons a collection much richer than any one library could maintain. Libraries are active in making government information more available, and they work to influence legislation to prevent intellectual property rights from adding new obstacles to access.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries have long worked to develop skills, most often needed by their underserved constituents, in language, literacy, and technology. As more information of increasingly variable quality becomes available, it becomes more and more necessary to evaluate its integrity and independence. With their staff and their patrons, public libraries are beginning to cultivate information literacy: the skills necessary to find, use, and critically evaluate information from many sources.\r\n\r\nSide by side with public libraries\' broad mission for an informed and active citizenry is a focus on the local community and civic dialog. The typical public library offers a public gathering space, available to all regardless of opinion or creed. It may provide a network connection to the local school so that youngsters can use library computers to perform their homework assignments. It may maintain an archive of local history and records, and care for cultural artifacts (such as paintings, for example) of local significance. This local focus can lead to collaborations with other local stakeholders; for example, in the case of a major local environmental issue such as industrial river pollution, the library may work with a government agency to host community meetings and include copies of the agencys reports in a collection of documents related to the issue.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries have a special mission to serve their underserved or information poor (Kranich, 2004, p. 287) constituents. Groups such as urban minorities and rural communities have special difficulty in surmounting the obstacles to accessing and using information and ideas. In some parts of the world, such as the rural north of Peru served by the Rural Library Network (Medcalf, 1999), library services develop literacy through books and storytelling. In situations such as this, public libraries transport books on foot or by pack animalcamels in Kenya, donkeys in Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\nThe public library is an established institution which offers a model for building new institutions and services. It enjoys broad public respect and support, and promotes principles central to democracy and development: (a) intellectual freedom, (b) access to information and to ideas both fashionable and unfashionable, and (c) serving the needs of the underrepresented. If the Navajo call the library a house of papers, it can be much more; through new technologies, new partnerships, and new services it offers what Josh Cohen, director of the Mid-Hudson Library System (www.midhudson.org), calls one of the cornerstones of democracy and one of the building blocks of a strong community.', 'To create access to information, civic participation, and life-long education, use what public libraries already offer and work with them to implement new services.

In addition to the manic novelty, the stories offer little real information, especially about alternatives or opportunities for public involvement. Even the \"news\" is entertainment. In the US (and other places) the \"market\" is credited / blamed for \"giving the people what they want.\" Thus while television and other commercial media stupefies people, the owners merely shrug their shoulders and say that they\'re just giving people what they want. This turns out often to be grisly murders, cheesy voyeurism, celebrity romance (or, better, divorce), and advertisements, advertisements, advertisements.

Who decides what issues are important, what issues are on the public agenda?', 'If the public agenda is simply the set of issues that people happen to have in their heads at any given time then we can say that a \"public agenda\" exists.

She first mentioned that she and her colleagues had been trying unsuccessfully to get these issues on the public agenda for a decade and that she was opposed to using violence against people or property. She went on to say, however, that one couldn\'t help but notice that after windows were smashed in Seattle the media, pundits and others seemed to acknowledge the issues more readily &mdash; at least for a week or so. Hence we make the argument here that <i>\"It shouldn\'t be necessary to break glass\"</i> for citizens and citizen groups to get a public airing for the issues that they feel are important. \r\n\r\nWhere do the \"pictures in our heads\" (Lippman, 1922) and the issues that we\'re contemplating at the moment come from?

We may interpret the information in our particular way but the new information is the driver &mdash; not something else. At any rate, it\'s not the idiosyncratic and disconnected thought that\'s important, it\'s the focused, diverse, engaged and thoughtful <i>collective</i> mind that democracy requires. The sounds and the images that the big electronic billboard, always there and always on, holds aloft for the world to view will obviously garner more attention (\"mind share\") than something with less visibility &mdash; which, of course, is everything else.

This paper demonstrated that the public\'s answers to the perennial Gallup Poll question \"What is the most important problem facing this country today?\" could be predicted quite clearly by looking at the news as presented by the newspapers, network television news, and news magazines that were available at that time in the month prior to the poll. In a more recent paper, McCombs reported that since the original article, \"more than 300 published studies worldwide have documented this influence of the news media.\" \r\n\r\nNow, some 35 years after the original publication, the media landscape has changed considerably. People (at least in the U.S.) have more choices and many apparently \"choose\" to be ill-informed. The mass media with its collage of seemingly random information about movie start divorces, dog food, genocide, game shows, laugh tracks, mass starvation, cell phones, climate change, \"shock jocks\", trailer fires, bus plunges, talking heads, celebrity chit-chat, invasions may be actually doing more to muddle than to inform. \r\n\r\nThe Internet, however, is currently providing an interesting challenge to the hegemony of the mass media. Community networks and Indymedia showed glimpses that other  ways of producing and consuming news were possible. The explosion of blogs of every type is the latest salvo along these lines. In fact, as of the end of the 2003, 2/3 of the blogs were political (Delwiche, 2005). The blogging phenomenon suggests many things including the blurring of the division between producers and consumers of journalism and the continuing fragmentation of journalism roles and venues. Some of the more interesting questions, recently explored by Aaron Delwiche (2005), are whether the blogs are &mdash; or can be &mdash; agenda-setters in their own right and whether they can serve as a tonic and an alternative to their mass-produced forbearers.\r\n\r\nIt would be naive to think the mass media will provide citizens with the information that they need without pressure from the citizenry. They\'ll say first that their first responsibility is their stockholders. We must remember that just because something is mentioned in the mass media doesn\'t mean that it\'s irrelevant and vapid. Although the previous statement was made with tongue in cheek, there is certainly a danger (as well as a temptation) to disregard all mass media. The realization that traditional (mass) media is ready and willing (and generally capable) of diverting attention from the important to the superfluous is a significant first step but it\'s just a start. Monitoring the media systems, constructing a broad and compelling alternative agenda must be an ongoing enterprise.', 'We need to think about what belongs on the public agenda and what we can do to put it there and keep it there. This may mean working in opposition to &mdash; and in cooperation with &mdash; existing media systems. It must certainly involve developing diverse and specialized \"public agendas\" including ones related to research as Carolyn Raffensperger and her colleagues advise (1999).', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2003-05-14 15:09:42', '2007-03-11 18:15:13', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(568, 548, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'The complexity of the world and multiplicity of perspectives with which to view it can often stymie peoples attempts to interpret it in ways that make sense and suggest meaningful action. People often can not see the connection between their own thinking and the situation they wish to address. Groups seeking to work together in some broad arena may not identify a common basis for doing so effectively. Sometimes groups can\'t even agree on what they would like to accomplish much less how to go about accomplishing it. At other times their efforts may not resonate with the people and organizations they are trying to influence. A similar problem arises when people reactively base their interpretation on some prior and frequently unconscious bias or stereotype, a fact that is consciously exploited through deceptive use of language. In all of these cases, a poor understanding of strategic frames hinders the ability of people to make progress in their pursuits.', 'This pattern can be used whenever people and groups need to interpret complex information or develop approaches to communicating with other groups or the public.', 'People all over the world are confronted with events and information that they find overwhelming. Without \"frames\" people quite literally would not know how to make sense out of what their senses provide. Frames provide the connection between information and data and the way that the information and data is interpreted. In other words, frames of one sort or another are necessary for every aspect of daily life. Human brains don\'t have the processing power to interpret each new situation \"from scratch.\" \r\n\r\nMany types of social scientists including social psychologists, linguists, and political scientists routinely use the concept of frames and framing to help understand how people interpret information. It is now being recognized by social scientists and neuroscientists that the context or framing of a event has a major effect on how it is interpreted and, hence, what course of action or inaction is pursued (De Martino et al 2006). Frames are apparently an economical way for the brain to process large amounts of information quickly, a skill undoubtedly linked to survival. A frame is deeply connected to cognition in individuals and is helpful in understanding other social phenomenon (such as learning) as well. \r\n\r\nThe concept of frames was initially developed by anthropologist Gregory Bateson (1972) and was further popularized by sociologist Erving Goffman (1974). More recently, based on the work of George Lakoff, a linguist at the University of California at Berkeley, framing has taken a prominent position in progressive political discourse (2004). On a general level, a frame in a social or political sense is a story distilled to its basic elements. It could be related to the family, father as protector, fairness, fatalism, laziness, freedom, a favored football team, nostalgia for the past, or fear of the unknown  the possibilities are limitless.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the ubiquity of frames and the fact that different frames can be employed by different people for different reasons to describe the same story or event has lead to a strong interest in frames and <i>framing</i>, the conscious act of characterizing a situation, event, or idea by specific frames that help encourage the interpretations that the framer desires. \r\n\r\nHow do frames work? When a person selects a frame (usually subconsciously) other aspects of that frame are automatically called into play. Labeling a person as an \"illegal immigrant,\" for example, causes connotations to arise that the term \"refugee\" would not. Framing the person in that way places the focus on that person and his or her \"illegality,\" not, for example, on the societal forces that caused him or her to leave home. \r\n\r\nAlthough political and economic elites and mass media are the major users of frames, the framing lens can and ought to be turned around and focused upwards as well. Mass media systems are the primary purveyors of frames and their choice of frames can have important consequences. The use of frames by journalists can be conscious or unconscious; conscious use can suggest manipulation while unconscious use may reveal fatigue, laziness, or a lack of understanding of the subject. A strategic communication terms web site (2008) refers to an example from Charlotte Ryans <i>Prime Time Activism</i> (1991) that illustrates multiple ways in which an incident of a child in a low-income neighborhood who was repeatedly bit by rats could be covered by the local television news stations. Because frames shape interpretation they also contain implications for what types of action are acceptable responses. Who, for example, should be held responsible for this unfortunate occurrence? Is the childs mother the culprit or should the apartment manger, the government heath department, or, even, society at large be reprimanded?\r\n\r\nA strategic frame is a specific type of frame that has been developed as an important element within an overall strategy to encourage people to see things in a certain way. In this sense, the concept is neutral. In fact Susan Niall Bales stated that her approach to Strategic Frame Analysis could be used to promote tobacco use, but added that she probably wouldnt consent to help with that effort. \r\n\r\nWhen frames are shared with people or organizations they promote group action and similar interpretations  while acting to discourage disputes and incompatible interpretation. When developed collaboratively, a strategic frame can also be a useful tool for groups. Keck and Sikkink (1998) illustrate the potential of frames to bring together disparate groups under one coalescing concept. The unifying theme of opposing \"violence against women\" became an important frame in the 1995 United Nations Conference on Women in Beijing. \r\n\r\nWhen people respond without reflection to an externally imposed strategic frame, they are being exploited. Different frames can be constructed for any given story, message or event. How well those frames resonate with people and what they choose to do with the ideas contained within the frame is of interest to people who are trying to influence other people. Opposing forces will employ different frames with different people to win the particular battle theyre engaged with. This is reflected in the recent New York Times article entitled, Framing Wars (Bai, 2005). Unfortunately many strategic frames that are available to the public serve to reinforce existing stereotypes, thus preventing people from developing effective agendas for the future. Frames allow people to quickly assess a situation, but they can also allow people to quickly assess a situation <i>incorrectly</i>. Unfortunately, too, the new evaluation, although easily and painlessly obtained is not as readily abandoned. Strategic frames work in two directions  they can channel progressive action but can also constrict and distort thought.\r\n\r\nWhen frames are acknowledged as independent entities, people who are interested in persuasion can begin asking such questions as: What frames do people use? How are they initially constructed or modified? What is the outcome when two or more frames compete? When does it make sense to create new frames? How does one know when people are trying to manipulate you using frames or if the frames you use are impeding creative thought?', 'Although frames are powerful, they are not destiny. The first step towards changing frames is understanding the frames that influence our actions and behavior. Activists are interested in identifying and in some cases creating frames which have specific functions of interest. These <i>strategic</i> frames help build coalitions, provide useful interpretations, and promote useful \"transformations from one set of interpretations to another (Tarrow 2005). New frames are typically bridged from the old ones. In other words, the new frames must not reach too far beyond the capability of people to grasp and shape them.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2003-05-14 15:10:40', '2008-01-16 11:58:23', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(569, 549, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'Communities often lack the type of information and communication infrastructure needed to: 1) support and sustain the social networks of clubs, organisations, associations, groups, agencies, families and individual citizens that constitute the structures, organisation and activities of community life; and 2) enable effective organisation, planning and enactment of local campaigns when threatened by external agency. Network technologies present interesting opportunities to support community networking activities but in and of themselves do not constitute community networks. Indeed, the ICT agenda of both public and commercial sectors is often hostile to the mutuality, collaboration and communicative processes required for building healthy communities (Day & Schuler, 2004). There is a need therefore for the development of appropriate and effective strategies that facilitate community appropriation of communication technologies in support of the social network relationships required to build, organise and sustain active communities.', 'Contemporary society is commonly described in terms of its networks, especially its technological networks. ICT, we are told, provide both the structure and organisation of the world in which we live. A natural corollary of this worldview is the oft encountered assumption that the social fabric of our lives is shaped by, and increasingly dependant upon, ICT. If this hypothesis is accurate, and the age in which we live is truly one characterised by information flows, communication patterns and the media infrastructure and applications that support these transactions then it is reasonable to question who and what influences the design and use of communication technologies? Similarly, it is reasonable to consider what alternatives might exist. With this in mind this pattern is intended as a contribution to, and perhaps even as a catalyst for, a much needed dialogue about the planning, design and potential for use of geographically located community networks. \r\n\r\nPerceived participants in such a dialogue would include: 1) Community members ', 'Despite growing numbers of claims that community no longer exists, people in all parts of the world continue to connect with one another to socialise, plan events and organise activities that build and improve the communities in which they live. Community is the building block of society. Social networks, trust, respect for diversity and a commitment to improving socio-cultural environments, i.e. social capital (Putnam, 2000), provide the conditions for building and sustaining healthy community.\r\n\r\nAs a social construct, community networks are not new and they are most certainly not a construct of the Information Age or Network Society. Community networks have been contributing to community life for many years. In his seminal text on the emergence of new, i.e. ICT based, community networks, Schuler explains how the term community networks was a sociological concept  that referred to community communication patterns and relationships (1996)  long before the emergence of the community bulletin boards of the late 1970s (Morino, 1994), i.e. the forerunners for the web-based community networks of the 1990s onwards (Kubicek & Wagner, 1998). \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the significance of communications and social relationships to community networking provides a starting point for addressing the challenges of planning, designing, developing and sustaining new community networks. Making connections and interacting with people of diverse values and belief systems is a crucial component of community networking. It is interesting then that community networks are increasingly referred to as technological artefacts (ref???) and appear to be understood in terms of the connectivity they give to ICT rather than the links they enable to be built within communities. \r\n\r\nMusing on this paradox led me to conduct a quick search for community networks on Wikipedia. The search linked me to 14 pages of content  all of which provided various descriptions of ICT related projects/activities. For example the community network page revealed that, Community Network is a term used broadly to indicate use of networking technologies by and for a local community (Wikipedia, 2006). \r\n\r\nWhilst this is certainly true, the statement lacks any sense of purpose. A slightly more developed definition refers to computer-based systems supporting, augmenting, and extending already existing social networks.  This hints at social rather than exclusively technological uses but it still does not address questions pertinent to community uses of network technologies. 1) For what purpose/s would communities want to use network technologies? 2) How can ICT benefit communities in ways that are meaningful to the communities themselves? \r\n\r\nEstablishing what lies at the heart of community networking, i.e. the purpose and nature of the relationships within communities and the processes of communication, is central to understanding what community is all about. Generating knowledge of what shapes and energizes community life is pivotal to developing effective community networks. In this respect the effectiveness of community networks is understood in terms of how they support and sustain community communications, relationships and activities. An example of how knowledge of community networking in its broadest sense can be generated and how this knowledge might inform the development of new community networks is illustrated by the Community Network Analysis (CNA) project  in the Poets Corner community of Brighton and Hove, UK.\r\n\r\nSpread over 31 small, tightly packed streets, Poets Corner is a demographically mixed community. A significant proportion of its housing stock is owner-occupied  many of which are being bought by London-based commuters. A consequence of this trend is that house prices are increasing beyond the reach of many locals  an interesting development in an area where the majority of the housing stock was built originally for artisans and factory workers! However, recent construction of social housing (with more imminent) and a fairly large sector of privately rented accommodation means that Poets Corner comprises a socio-economically diverse population ranging from comfortable affluence to social exclusion and poverty. The area also has a mixed socio-cultural demographic. All of which, once youre connected to the local social networks, makes Poets Corner an interesting and vibrant place to be. \r\n\r\nSpace does not permit a fuller description of Poets Corner neither does it allow an account of the CNA research methodology to be developed here but as part of our early activities in the area we conducted a community profile (Hawtin, Hughes & Percy-Smith, 1994). A range of typical tools were employed to develop the profile but in order to add richness, character and authenticity to the pictures of the community being developed, we introduced innovative use of story-telling techniques. This was significant in developing our relationship with the local community and in assisting our understanding of Poets Corner past and present. The 104 community groups, clubs, associations, centres, organisations, etc. that comprise this small, eclectic community often interpret their shared social environment in different ways. Acknowledging the existence of such diversity is a central part of beginning to understand and work with it as a source of community strength rather than community threat. \r\n\r\nSubsequent social network analysis of the community infrastructure reveals 8 main clusters of groups, clubs, etc. and 4 smaller clusters. These clusters, or affiliation networks, are organised by a parent organisation, e.g. community associations and worship-based locations. Connectivity appears to be based around organisational support mechanisms and the availability of physical space. A number of isolated nodes or didactic networks also exist, e.g. the two schools are exemplars of a didactic network, although both are keen to develop stronger ties within the community.\r\n \r\nMost communications within the community network appear to occur within cluster boundaries. That is to say that despite geographic proximity, connectivity or communication between clusters is not as commonplace as might be expected. When cross community network communications do occur they are usually mediated through a small number of key actors who populate more than one network cluster. These people are central not only to community communications but community activities as a whole, e.g. the annual summer festival and family fun day. Consequently, they are also key to the building and sustaining of social capital in the community. However, when they are unable to fulfil their roles, community communication and activities suffer, which perhaps explains why, one of the first questions put to the CNA team by our community partners was whether ICT could assist in building and strengthening communication links in the community? Of course, this is not just a technological question. It has significant community development implications and we resolved early in the project to work with local agencies and organisations to support their work in addressing this and other community identified communication problems.\r\n\r\nThe informal network structures in the community are altogether more open and dynamic than their formal counterparts but they are also quite transient in nature. Networking often occurs initially in public spaces, e.g. Stoneham Park, local pubs and coffee shops, and serendipitous street meetings. These spaces become agora in which mutual support, knowledge exchange, human contact and comfort networks can emerge. \r\n\r\nInformal social network activities tend to be support based and fall into one of two categories. 1) They are spontaneous in nature, e.g. someones cat has gone missing and the neighbours organise a search of the locality; neighbours leave bags of good quality but unwanted clothes/toys on the door steps of families new to the area as a welcoming gesture; groups of people pop in to each others houses for coffee and a chat  reinforcing and developing social bonds. 2) They are slightly more organised but have no formal membership, e.g. networks of baby-sitters and parents requiring sitters evolve through the local grapevine, a curry club  where participants try new curry recipes is organised at irregular intervals by email, a book club  run along much the same lines as the curry club is organised by mobile phone, or key holder networks among neighbours in the same street  in which spare keys are cut and distributed among trusted neighbours. Such networks play an important role in developing relationships of trust and social cohesion in the community and are often underpinned by technologies that people feel comfortable with, i.e. that they already use. \r\n\r\nAlthough we have only begun to scratch the surface in identifying these networks, the challenge for the CNA project, is to develop an understanding of their contribution to social capital. Such knowledge will enable us to establish whether the conditions for their existence can be created within the prototype community communications space (CCS) being developed as part of the project. If ICT are to support the diversity of social realities that exist in a community network they must start by providing spaces for community voices to be heard and needs to be met. Enabling people to tell their stories and interact with one another in ways that are meaningful to them and in environments that they are comfortable with is an important part of the valorisation of diversity that underpins effective community networking.\r\n\r\nThe CCS provides ICT based support for community networking activities by creating additional public and private spaces for the Poets Corner community. Based on the open source Plone content management system (CMS), the CCS is being designed with local people to address community information and communication needs. The use of Plone has not been without its problems though. Although flexible, standards compliant and modular in design  attributes that community users welcome  our partners have found Plone complex and counter-intuitive at times but this might because it is new to them. At the moment we take the view that these difficulties form part of the community (and community research) learning process. At the moment, they (and we) have elected to carry on with what we planned but we will not rule out changing to another to another platform, if the community desire it.\r\n\r\nMultimedia in nature the CCS supports video and audio podcasting, digital story-telling, digital art, poetry and music. Local communication forums are being established to support community development/building processes currently underway but it is anticipated that these forums will spread as community members learn to use them. The CCS also facilitates blogging and other social software applications; provides spaces for local web pages, notice boards, local diaries, visitor pages and a growing range of social networking applications are being considered.\r\n\r\nThe exciting developments outlined above indicate how ICT are beginning to be utilised in support of a wide range of community activities in Poets Corner but this should not deflect from the significance of developing effective community engagement strategies. At the beginning of the CNA project we resolved to operate using the Community Development Foundations (CDF) participation ready model (Chanan, Garratt & West, 2000)  i.e. start by working with those in the community ready and able to work with you. As community development occurs, news of the activities spreads throughout the community and more participants emerge. Translating this in terms of CNA activities we can say that as awareness of the CCS is increasing so community interest in participating is increasing. However, it should be noted that at this stage most interest lies within the community infrastructure, although individual residents are now beginning to join up as members of the CCS. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, the CDF model is not dissimilar to elements of Rogers diffusion of innovation theory (1995). The graphic below illustrates stages in the diffusion of the Poets Corner CCS. Only individuals who have actually joined the CCS prototype, rather than used, are represented in the graphic. Similarly, the graphic should not be interpreted as a representation of community involvement in the various elements of the CNA project overall.\r\n\r\nDiffusion of the CCS is from the centre outwards and each phase or stage of the process is represented by one of 3 concentric circles. The first circle represents our invitation from the Poets Corner Residents Society (PCRS) and the subsequent invitation by the PCRS executive committee to work in partnership with them to map and improve community communications. Much of this period was spent getting to know people in the community, building trust, raising awareness and supporting the activities of PCRS and other community groups. A group of keen advocates of the CNA project emerged as CCS innovators in Poets Corner. With their assistance the project became more grounded and supportive of community activities and needs. In this way trust was built and the sphere of influence of the project increased. \r\n\r\nSlowly but surely a number of community groups began to display an interest in the project and began working with us. The second concentric circle shows early adopters within the community infrastructure. By this time, the project was participating in and supporting the planning and organisation of a second summer festival and family fun day. During the 2 week period of the summer festival, the team organised a range of ICT awareness-raising and support activities, together with a programme of participatory learning workshops (PLWs). \r\n\r\nThe third concentric circle illustrates a resultant increased involvement from the community infrastructure and the beginning of some involvement from local residents. It too early to present this as evidence of early majority involvement and is best described as a second stage of early adoption activity. What is clear is that the CNA partnership has been raising awareness of the potential of the CCS and interest within the community is on the increase. We are now in the trial and evaluation phases of Rogers adoption model as the community infrastructure begin to assess whether ICT, in their present project form, can be used for community networking purposes. It remains to be seen whether or not the CCS will be adopted by the majority of the community and whether this adoption can be sustained beyond the funding of the project. \r\n\r\nAlthough I present a normative view of community here it is important to recognise that community is a contested space! Community is as much about tensions, differences and disputes as it is about people working together for the common good. The state of balance between these forces is affected by the ties that exist within the community network.\r\n\r\nAs the intention behind this pattern is dialogic rather than prescriptive, I have reflected on some of the experiences we have encountered in Poets Corner during the CNA project. Rather than describe how the pattern should be used, I invite readers to reflect on how the pattern might be used within their community and to share their experiences and views with us. We believe that effective community networking strategies require dialogic communications and knowledge sharing. They should be grounded in relationships of trust and mutual respect. They should celebrate diversity and respect differences whilst striving to achieve to common ground. Effective community networking strategies must be grounded in the needs and assets of community life. They must implicitly and explicitly display an understanding of community communications and the relationships existing within and between the social networks. They must also address a dominant ICT culture that is at worst inherently antithetical to community supportive communication spaces and at best orthogonal in that it socialises passive use and individual information consumption as opposed to empowerment and communicative action.', 'Whilst the effectiveness of new community networks is dependent on the development of dialogic partnerships within and between the social networks that comprise community life, challenges exist within the external and internal environments of a community that also require consideration. Although dialogic partnerships provide scope and potential for shared learning and mutual benefit between the community, community practitioners and the external experts often involved in the development of community network initiatives, it cannot be simply assumed that the community will adopt a community network. They will not come just because it has been built! \r\n\r\nEffective community networking partnerships must develop community engagement strategies that recognize and valorise the significance of different knowledge forms within the partnerships. These should be both equitable and respectful, e.g. technologists can build great communication systems but lack community knowledge. Community members have community knowledge but lack technical expertise. Together, through dialogic planning and mutual understanding, they can build great community communication systems.\r\n\r\nA community must want to use and be part of a community network if the network is to succeed. In many cases this will require that people step out of the comfort zone of their daily lives and embrace technologies that are unfamiliar to them. However, weve seen in Poets Corner that people intuitively use ICT they are comfortable with to support their social and community networking activities. Wherever possible, in order to facilitate community learning and encourage community ownership and identity, community engagement and awareness raising strategies should be located within the context of everyday community activities, e.g. how might podcasting or blogging be useful and relevant to the activities of a local campaign group. \r\n\r\nThe diffusion of a community network and its subsequent sustainability is dependent on communities understanding their usefulness and relevance to modern community life. Effective community network strategies should reflect this by developing relationships of trust that facilitate and support community learning processes in all parts of the community. In the same way that community networking processes encourage communication for community planning, organisation and action purposes, so too should community network strategies encourage community participation in the planning, designing, implementation and ongoing development of a community network.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2003-05-14 15:17:57', '2006-10-05 22:18:01', NULL, NULL, 'CNA Project', NULL, 348, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This modus operandi seems to be uncommon in practice (and would no doubt be the envy of all the despots). The defenders of the status quo, though loutish and dangerous, are often capricious and incompetent, and they are generally stymied by insufficient resources. The ambiguity of the laws and the ambiguity of the presumed offenses also can work in favor of the journalist. \r\n\r\nThe former Soviet Union and its satellites provided the fertile soil for an independent press that operated on the margins of the law for several decades. This is the classic \"samizdat\" distribution in which readers painstakingly and secretly copied by hand or via typewriter and carbon paper, multiple copies of entire books which were then passed on to others who would do the same. \r\n\r\nIn the \"developed world\" journalists and other media workers are specialized: one person intones the news of the day, using video clips that another person edited which was shot by another person during an interview conducted by another person as ordered by another person.  When the political climate turns nasty and journalists are beaten-up, threatened or killed by government soldiers, paramilitary troops or thugs, when resources dry up or when disaster or wartime situations erupt, journalists habituated to the strict division of labor may be unable to adopt the more flexible and improvisational mode of news production when that becomes necessary.  Journalists with overspecialized, deep but narrow, skills will find that they are unable to respond quickly and flexibly when their tried-and-true practices fail due to unexpected circumstances. \r\n\r\nAlternative news distribution involves a canny cat and mouse game between those who believe in the free distribution of information and those who don\'t. Living within an actively hostile environment, it will be necessary to keep changing the way that business is done to meet new challenges. Unlike journalists in the US or other developed countries, journalists must adept in many modes of reporting, many approaches to distribution, a variety of tactics and strategies and the inventive use of what\'s available to get the job done, as befits what B92 journalist Veran Matic calls a \"universal journalist, not an encyclopedic polymath who is informed in different fields, but a professional familiar with print journalism, radio and television, online journalism and information distribution mechanisms.\" This is what I call a <i>bricoleur-journalist</i> who sends the sounds that accompany the scene at voting station in Africa can go directly over the air via a cell phone with an open line to the radio station. Audio cassettes, printed broadsides or, more commonly today, DVDs can be distributed when the plug is pulled on a radio station (as it was three times during B92\'s early years of confronting Milosevic). And bricoleur-journalists in different cultures and settings, such as Chinese pro-democracy or environmental activists, will assume any number of local variants. \r\n\r\nAn interesting, unexpected issue seems to surface from time-to-time by the underground media (and society in general) after the fall of an oppressive regime. (fate of art and literature)  Ironically, many people who worked closely with clandestine media over the years now feel unsettled in the post-soviet environment. After communism fell the former trickle of information became a tsunami of mostly commercial offerings. When information was scarce and in danger of extinction possessed an almost sacred allure.  Now the same type of information is lost in the flood, just more anonymous flotsam and jetsam in a torrent of images and sounds. \r\n\r\nSamizdat or clandestine journalism doesn\'t always succeed of course. Translating the success of the samizdat or underground press to other regions under oppressive regimes is far from automatic. A potential audience that is interested in the material must exist &mdash; as with the media in any situation &mdash; and there must be some way to get the material to them. Some of these people earnestly want social change and believe there is some degree, however small, of hope that this outcome is achievable. Interestingly, and somewhat contrary to conventional wisdom, some people in the potential audience are motivated by their desire to <i>know</i> the truth whether it helps to actually change the situation or not. At any rate, the larger and more active and supportive the audience is, the more likely that the alternative press will succeed. On the other side of the equation are the journalists &mdash; potential and actually &mdash; and the absence of either audience or journalists can prevent the enterprise from being successful. \r\n\r\nAlthough precarious, alternative media production actually builds civic capacity. According to Anna Husarka who worked for Poland\'s Solidarity Information Bureau in 1989, the journalism they practiced \"was a political blueprint for the democratic struggles that dismantled communism.\" It is also important to note that traditional \"news\" is not the only \"product\" of an alternative media project. The B92 enterprise (which started as a college radio station in Belgrade) now includes Radio B92, Television B92, B92.net (Web site), B92 publishing (books and magazines), B92 music label, B92.Rex cultural centre, B92.concert agency, and B92.communications (Internet provision and satellite links) amply illustrates the rich potential of a \"media\" that chooses to embrace the widest range of outlets. One of their biggest and most successful projects was \"Rock for Vote,\" the biggest rock tour in Serbia\'s history, \"a traveling festival with 6 to 8 bands playing in 25 cities and towns throughout the country.\" The tour was organized while organizers and activists \"were being molested, harassed and detained by the police on a daily basis.\" In spite of that 150,000 citizens attended the concerts. Most importantly the results of the 2000 elections demonstrated that their main objective was attained: \"80% of first-time voters did go to the polls after all ... casting their ballots to bring about fundamental changes in the country.\"\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, some media operations that developed during a period of hostility have had a difficult time making the transition from a post-war or post-oppressive regime. On the other hand, Gazeta Wyborcza, one of Poland\'s leading underground newspapers in the 1980s, which was started in a kindergarten classroom became one of the most influential and commercially viable dailies in Poland [Smillie, 1999].) B92, in least in the immediate aftermath of the troubles in Serbia, continued innovative programming that reflected their terrifying past. For example, they launched a Truth and Reconciliation process that included radio shows and a series of books about the wars (including the Srebrenica crimes) and disintegration of former Yugoslavia. They also convened a conference \"In Search for Truth and Reconciliation\" in 2000 that was attended by journalists, intellectuals and representatives of NGOs from all former Yugoslav republics took part and another conference \"Truth, Responsibility and Reconciliation\" the following year that featured experiences of other countries in similar processes. Radio B92 also set up a special documentation archive on the wars which included testimonies, documentaries, video footage, books and other documents. They also arranged \"exhibitions, screenings of documentaries and public discussions on these topics are being organized throughout Serbia\" (Matic, 2004).', 'Producing &mdash; and consuming &mdash; or other types of cultural or journalistic media with hostile societies can be hazardous to emotional as well as physical health.

We have come to think there is more integrity/objectivity in facts that are for facts sake only.  There is no continent on the face of the earth that has not been affected by 20th Century thought.  This line of mechanistic thought is incorporated in the economic systems of all Western societies and the remaining world also.  Our world economic system reflects this Western thinking at different degrees in different countries.', 'Some people believe this mechanistic approach to economics can be repaired with a patch job.  Just build on an addition of human values to our current economic system like adding a family room or garage to a house.  I venture to say these retrofit ideas won\'t work.  To change our current mechanistic approach, we would actually have to implode the entire world economic system.  I don\'t recommend this type of destruction either.  There are other options.  The one I propose is to build a values based generative structure that is not in conflict with the current economic system.  This would not be a patch or a fix; it would be more like a fizzle of the old economic system and an awakening of a new one.', 'Stephen Grabow said that Christopher Alexander saw a generating system like a kit of parts or components, together with the rules for combining them to make wholes---\"a way of focusing attention on some particular holistic behavior in a thing, which can only be understood as a product of interaction among the parts.\"1  In my pattern, A \"Whole\" New Economic System of Household \"Centers\"  I suggested this new economic \"kit\" could be made up of household economies.  Each household has it\'s own economic pattern and these patterns make up the parts or components of the \"kit\".  However, the \"whole\" economic environment is not made up of parts, components or things.  Instead the parts or household patterns are defined by their relationship to the \"whole\" economic system.  This new economic system would be generative in that it is awakened as each household pattern is defined and \"centered\" in relationship to the whole.\r\n\r\nThe graphic above is a drawing made my Ojibwe clan chiefs who are each represented in the picture by an animal.  The clao', 'My thought is to design an input system along the line of this pattern system.  The new economic input system would allow each household to begin developing their own economic pattern.  To begin with these patterns will be very much like a 20th Century financial plan.  From this old world financial plan each household would have the opportunity to begin interjecting their personal values into a new world financial pattern developed on the input system.  One household might add the value of a garden to their financial pattern.  Another household might add in the personal value of not working 40 to 60 hours per week.  Another might add the value to their children of having a grandparent live with them.  Perhaps an individual would like to change their employment so they can walk to work.  Perhaps I myself would like to plant trees because this would make my world more valuable to me.  As each person and each household builds on their financial pattern they become more \"centered\" with their own values.  Each household becomes more personally involved with their own economic sustainability and who they are in relation to the rest of the economic world.  As household patterns are put into the system economic relationships build and rules are developed.  Economic \"centers\" of value emerge that become collective action groups.  Trust bridges and technical links are built to allow the households to do personal business with one another.  Households start to have a major effect on the economic landscape by their new voice and economic clout.

However, Christopher Alexander\'s concept of \"wholeness\" and the theory of \"centers\" is a perfect fit for a new generative economic system.', 'According to Alexander \"wholeness\" starts with a blank slate.  When one dot appears on the slate a \"center\" or multiple \"centers\" are created in relationship to the \"whole\".  When a second dot appears on the slate the environment is changed and new \"centers\" are created, \"centers\" within \"centers\".  As dots appear on the slate the \"whole\" is awakened and becomes alive.  The whole is not made up of entities but the entities are defined by their relationship to the \"whole\".  \"The structure which is created is essentailly a structure of centers and the process by which this structure is created is one operation which is performed over and over again.\"  It consists of making, elaborating, strengthening, or completing some center which exists, or begins to exist, or has the potential to exist.\"', 'In the graphic above, think of each dot as an economic household.  The first household creates an economic pattern on the blank economic \"whole\".  The second household creates an economic pattern and the economic environment begins to change.  The household pattern dots are repeated over and over as more households create a pattern. Each is an economic household \"center \"and becomes part of a larger structure of economic household \"centers\".  A new economic system comes alive as more \"centers\" appear on the economic \"whole\".  It is a paradigm shift in that our old economic system is not destroyed but a new type of household economic system comes into view.  More people see it, participate in it, and believe in the economic \"whole\".  A generative economic structure is formed as the creation of household economic patterns are created over and over again.  The above  graphic is ceiling detail from the Palacio de Comares, Alhambra, Granada.   This graphic gives us a visual picture of what the \"whole\" system of houshold economies could look like.  This two dimensional visual view of a household economic system may help you realize how households can be conected by their \"centeredness\".  Now imagine this household economic system in three dimensions all tied together by computer technology.  Each houshold is tied to any other household with shared \"centeredness\".  Inside each household economy are the human values that create life for the individual household pattern.  The economic \"whole\" is awakened by the economic household \"centers\".  The household \"centers\" are alive because of their relationship to the \"whole\".  There is a helpful, holistic relationship between the economic \"whole\" and the economic \"centers\".  A \"whole\", new economic paradigm is begun.', 'The difficulty in starting the new economic system is not in overcomming the old, engrained economic system.  The difficulty is in learning to see the \"centers\" of the new economic system.  For this we need to be trained or made aware of \"wholeness\".  Christopher Alexander begins our technical training in the Appendices of his book \"The Phenomenon of Life\".  First he gives a mathematical \"Definition of Wholeness\", then \"A Detailed Example of Wholeness (W)\".  Alexander explains \"The Cognitive Difficulty of Seeing Wholeness\".  Then he draws \"A New Type of Mathematical Field Reguired to Represent Living Structure and the Bootstrap Field of Centers.\"  Christopher Alexander\'s context is to architecture but he realizes his concepts are important to all living structures.  \"For the sake of our own welfare, the world must be made so that it contains and is built from, living structure.\"  This is a call to action to develop living structures.

When this antagonism becomes institutionalized, through policy, public attitude, or propaganda, warfare or other violence becomes a natural consequence. The unique powers of individual people to help overcome these rifts by calming tempers, building ties, promoting reason and dialogue, or healing wounds is rarely acknowledged or promoted. Sometimes, as a matter of fact, the efforts of the rare person who strives to develop personal connections with \"the enemy\" is demonized by people on both \"sides.\"', 'This pattern can be applied whenever a country\'s stance towards another country is antithetical to the needs and values of civil society. This can happen before, during, or after a war or other period of hostility and mistrust.', 'The use of the concept of \"citizen diplomacy\" was apparently first applied when <a href=\"http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC09/CitDip.htm\">US citizens journeyed to the former Soviet Union</a> in the 1980s and met with activists, educators, scientists, health professionals and \"ordinary\" citizens. These citizens &mdash; and their Soviet counterparts &mdash; did not want to accept the \"inevitability\"of war, either hot or cold, and sought to find common ground on which to build a more peaceful future for everybody. Citizen diplomacy offers the promise of (world?) peace by building on actual, hopeful and optimistic face-to-face encounters by citizens of the designated enemy states.\r\n\r\nThe idea for this pattern, like others in the language, arose in a specific historical context, namely in the late 1980\'s during the protracted \"cold war\" between the Warsaw Pact nations (most notably the Soviet Union) and the NATO countries (most notably the USA). Although the information reported here is based on experiences from that time, it is expected that this pattern will be applicable in a great variety of situations in which two (or more) states or other large groups are enemies. Several antagonistic dyads come to mind &mdash; India and Pakistan; Israel and the Arab States; the US and Cuba or Venezuela &mdash; and each situation contains its own unique opportunities and risks. \r\n\r\nPeople who engage in projects along these lines certainly fit Richard Falk\'s description of a \"citizen pilgrim\" who is willing to go on a quixotic journey for a seemingly improbable goal. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, especially in a pre-Internet era, many of the collaborative efforts (described in Citizen Diplomacy: Progress Report 1989: USSR) were related to the use of information and communication. Some of the projects include __________\r\n\r\nThe collaborative projects themselves are subject to enormous challenges. Simply meeting with people from \"the other side\" presents great obstacles (including financial costs, legal restrictions on travel to &mdash; and within &mdash; the other country, privacy of communications, and access to people). Furthermore, any collaborative project, unless it is done clandestinely, will exist \"at the pleasure\" of the powers-that-be. In fact, one of the ultimate risks inherent in a project like this is that individuals being used or manipulated by the powers-that-be (such as the media, state power, think-tanks, political parties, or religious institutions)  in ways that simply overwhelm the hopes and energy of the citizen-diplomat.  \r\n\r\nSince the unraveling of the Soviet Union in the early 1990\'s, the global situation as noted above has changed considerably. The rough parity of power (exemplified to some degree by the size of their nuclear weapon stockpiles) between the Warsaw Pact countries and the NATO countries and the promise of \"Mutually Assured Destruction\" (or MAD) helped prevent direct confrontation and led to numerous \"proxy conflicts\" which were sponsored in part by the combatant\'s respective superpower allies. The military parity has now largely dissolved and the arms race between the US and the USSR has given way to a one-sided arms race where the US appears now to be competing with the rest of the world; its military expenditures (including several new nuclear weapons) now amounts to nearly half of the world\'s military expenditures. \r\n\r\nFinally it must be said that it\'s not obvious that collaborative projects like these will yield any long-lasting benefits. An interesting example is that when the US media entered the Soviet Union after Glasnost, they followed the routes that the citizen diplomats has established.

(AP Photo/Roman von Eckstein) <br>\r\nThe assemblies\' projects range from a community vegetable garden to a neighborhood bank in which people can put their savings in order to keep them out of the financial system, where strict limits on cash withdrawals were imposed by the government in early December to prevent a run on banks.</table>\r\n\r\nNeighborhood associations on the west side of Buenos Aires successfully pressured the Edesur power company to consider the possibility of a 180-day suspension of cut-offs due to delay in paying bills. Assemblies in other neighborhoods are demanding discount electricity rates for the unemployed.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of neighborhood assemblies has boomed since the mass demonstrations that led to the resignation of president Fernando de la Rúa on Dec 20. The violence and brutal police crackdown on DEC 19 and 20 left a death toll of 30.\r\n\r\nAt the assembly meetings, which are generally held in plazas or other public spaces, political and economic issues of national interest and pressing local problems are discussed.\r\n\r\nThe main focus is usually on the crisis faced by the public hospitals, unemployment (which has soared to 23 percent), and the widespread hunger and inability of families to buy food - questions that the neighborhood assemblies complain have received less than adequate attention from the country\'s political leaders.\r\n\r\nLocal residents who have been organizing in lower-income suburbs to the north, south and west of Buenos Aires have become the targets of violence. Municipal employees and sympathizers of the traditional parties - the Justice (Peronist) Party and the Radical Civic Union - have attempted to intimidate the more active members of the associations, some of whom have even been beaten up.\r\n\r\nA nurse at a hospital in the western suburb of Morón said she was beaten to unconsciousness by a stranger who had trailed her for several days.\r\n\r\nAt a neighborhood assembly, the nurse had complained that the leader of her trade union did not defend the workers, due to his political ties.\r\n\r\nWhen the neighborhood association in Merlo, west of the capital, began to grow in size and strength, around 200 men wearing no shirts broke into one of the meetings and beat local residents with ax handles, a teacher who has become a local activist told IPS. After that incident, one of the rooms in the activist\'s home mysteriously caught fire.\r\n\r\nTelephone threats and different forms of repression - in which the police have generally not been involved - have become routine for members of the neighborhood assemblies. Local merchants even complain that tax inspectors show up to carry out audits as soon as they put up signs in their shop windows calling local residents together for an assembly.\r\n\r\nPresident Eduardo Duhalde, who was designated by Congress on Jan 1 to govern until September 2003, has criticized the neighborhood assembly movement. \'\'It is impossible to govern with assemblies. The democratic way to organize and participate is through voting,\'\' he said.\r\n\r\nWhile the leaders of the traditional political parties discredit the phenomenon, the neighborhood assemblies complain of a vacuum of power, which has led them to take their problems into their own hands.\r\n\r\n\'\'The question of hunger is an urgent one,\'\' said a local resident of Morón in an assembly. \'\'We cannot continue delaying our response to the offer by INTA (the National Institute of Agricultural Technology) of 200 empty hectares to plant a community garden. We have to decide who is going to work there, and what we are going to produce.\'\'\r\n\r\nA younger resident called for an acceleration of the discussion of special tariffs for public services.\r\n\r\nHe also urged the assemblies to press their demand that a delegate be allowed to participate in the negotiations with the utility companies, the government and consumer groups, to keep the companies from \'\'taking advantage of the circumstances to increase electricity rates during the World Football Cup (in Japan and South Korea) in June.\'\'\r\n\r\nAlthough the activity of the assemblies has not slowed down, assistance has waned in recent weeks, several participants told IPS.\r\n\r\n\'\'It seems that less people are showing up now,\'\' Cristina Guerra, a 54-year-old nurse who has been unemployed for five months, told IPS. \'\'That always happens - after the crisis comes to a head, participation falls off. But the important thing is that the assemblies continue to meet, to change a world that no one is satisfied with anymore.\r\n\r\n\'\'We are living in a cruel system, a society for the few, and the way to change that is by participating in these new spaces created by the people,\'\' said the nurse.\r\n\r\nGuerra said that in December, a \'\'rupture\'\' occurred between the people and the government. She predicted that local political leaders in the suburbs of Buenos Aires would attempt to obstruct the phenomenon of the assemblies.\r\n\r\n\'\'They only like to see people mobilizing in their favor, their political clients,\'\' who receive favors like food in exchange for participating in rallies and demonstrations, she said.\r\n\r\n\'\'If we are able to solve some of our problems, we will create a parallel power. If we obtain, for example, a 50 percent discount in utility rates for the unemployed and for people with low incomes, we will take a leap forward in quality, and will have many more people participating,\'\' said Guerra.\r\n\r\nResidents in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Palermo Viejo have organized a first aid clinic while they continue discussing the problems plaguing the local hospital. In Ramos Mejía, on the outskirts of the capital, even the director of the local medical center has taken part in the neighborhood assembly.\r\n\r\nAssemblies are held once a week throughout the entire metropolitan region. They then send delegates to periodic \'\'inter- neighborhood meetings to share their experiences and discuss their common concerns.\r\n\r\nThe participants want to make sure the organizations maintain a \'\'horizontal\'\' power structure, with rotating moderators and the creation of commissions to study the proposals that are formulated.\r\n\r\nMany assembly members believe it is possible for their organizations to eventually take on tasks that the government is unable to carry out effectively.\r\n\r\nAccording to Juan Mosca, an aeronautics industry worker from the town of Castelar, the assemblies should discuss \'\'the issues of democracy.\'\'\r\n\r\nThat view is shared by many residents of the greater Buenos Aires (a city of over 12 million people) who cast blank or spoiled ballots in the October parliamentary elections to signal their rejection of the political class. (Voting is compulsory in Argentina.)\r\n\r\n\'\'On DEC 19 and 20, the pact by which the leaders represented the people was broken, and our constitution no longer prevails. If it did, there wouldn\'t be 15 million poor (out of a total population of 37 million) or so many abuses,\'\' said Mosca, 57, mounted on his bicycle after an inter-neighbourhood assembly in Morón.\r\n\r\n\'\'That\'s why I brought to this inter-neighbourhood meeting Castelar\'s proposal to begin discussing who will govern tomorrow, what our political designs and goals will be, and how we are going to replace our leaders and our judges,\'\' said Mosca, a veteran community activist.\r\n\r\nSince Argentina\'s four-year recession peaked in December\'s crisis, at least one out of three people surveyed by the local Hugo Haime polling firm say they have taken part in a neighborhood assembly or in a \'\'caceroleo\'\' (pot-and-pan-banging protest) at least once.\r\n\r\nOf the respondents, 35 percent say the assemblies constitute \'\'a new form of political organization,\'\' 16 percent believe that \'\'new leadership will emerge\'\' from the movement, and 21 percent say the effervescence will eventually die down.\r\n\r\nThe assemblies are gaining a growing space in the media, while they have begun to create their own alternative channels. A Morón radio station broadcasts the program \'\'Assembly Hour\'\', and the associations produce their own newspaper, \'\'Argentina is Burning\'\'.\r\n\r\n\'\'Some people believe our numbers have shrunk. But those of us who are left are the ones who really want to do things, the ones who want to stop complaining in our homes and do what the politicians are not doing: work out our day-to-day problems, without political-party machines, just us and our organizations,\'\' said Guerra.\r\n<center>\r\nCopyright 2002 IPS\r\n### </center>\r\n</font>\r\n<font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"1\" color=\"#222222\">FAIR USE NOTICE</font>\r\n<font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"1\">This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Toiling under the social stigma of gleaning for their food, these three women scoured the fields after the harvest for the leftovers to which they were entitled under French law. The film \"To Be and To Have\" provides another inspiring example. Through a simple and unhurried portrait of a school teacher in a small French village, the viewer understands his concerns for the children in the one-room school house, his hobbies and his connections with the entire village.

Cleveland\'s friend, Paul dela Cuesta, also was honored last night.\r\n\r\nTwo friends, Robert Cleveland and Paul dela Cuesta, are going to college.\r\n\r\nYesterday, they stood at home plate at Safeco Field, introduced as recipients of Jackie Robinson scholarships -- money that will pay for a year of tuition at The Evergreen State College in Olympia.\r\n\r\nThousands of fans cheered, and Cleveland and dela Cuesta basked in the spotlight, smiling broadly.\r\n\r\nThe scholarships, started by an Evergreen faculty member in 1988, are offered each year to a select few students of color who demonstrate not only academic excellence, but, like baseball legend Robinson, are also committed to community involvement and social justice.\r\n\r\nDela Cuesta, 45, who is of Filipino and Portuguese descent, and Cleveland, a 50-year-old Native American, are quick to humble themselves before the mystery of how and why their lives turned from the streets to the classroom.\r\n\r\n\"I got the chance and want to give that to others,\" dela Cuesta says. \"That\'s what keeps me going. If I didn\'t have this chance, I don\'t know where I\'d be.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland describes himself as \"full of gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had already made up my mind that I was never going to get an education and die on the street,\" he says.\r\n\r\nFlash back four years to when the men first met -- at New Vision, a refuge for the down-and-out on Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\nThe live-in drug and alcohol recovery program run by Union Gospel Mission opened its doors about 15 years ago.

Others can linger longer if they have specific goals to accomplish.\r\n  Robert Cleveland at New Vision\r\n  Zoom Mike Urban / P-I\r\n  Robert Cleveland, right, overcame years of alcohol and drug abuse by turning to New Vision, a refuge for the down-and-out on Capitol Hill. Cleveland, 50, and his friend, Paul dela Cuesta, 45, plan to enroll at The Evergreen State College in the fall.\r\n\r\nCleveland stayed for 3 1/2 years.\r\n\r\n\"His education became real important to him, so we wanted him to be able to complete that,\" said New Vision director Frederic Robinson.\r\n\r\nCleveland grew up in Palmdale, Calif., where \"you either worked for the police department or you were in prison,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"None of my family worked for the police.\"\r\n\r\nHe enlisted in the Army in 1971 and wound up being sent to Vietnam as a door gunner on a helicopter. He\'ll never forget that first day in the skies on patrol. He was nearly killed twice before lunch, he says.\r\n\r\nCleveland turned to drugs and got careless, peddling heroin to an undercover agent. In February 1972, he was booted out of the military.\r\n\r\nBack home, his life only got worse. He watched in horror as his father was shot to death inside his home during a drunken dispute. The shooter was his father\'s girlfriend.\r\n\r\n\"I gave up living like a normal person and started living a crazy, desperate life,\" Cleveland says.\r\n\r\nHe fell deeper into addiction. One day, he woke up in a hospital. He had been in a drug-induced coma.\r\n\r\nOver the years, he racked up 11 DUIs, and now considers it something of a miracle that he never hurt anyone. He also became a brawler. His rap sheet includes five assaults on California police officers.\r\n\r\nCleveland\'s redemption began when he followed one of his brothers, also an addict, to New Vision.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three years, Cleveland recovered his health and cleared his head. He realized he needed an education.\r\n\r\nAt 48, he enrolled at Seattle Central Community College intent on re-making his life.\r\n\r\n\"My first day of school, I was afraid,\" he recalls. \"Just like a kindergartner.\"\r\n\r\nHe wound up missing only one day of school. Last spring, he earned his associate in arts degree in social human services.\r\n\r\nThanks to his new scholarship, Cleveland is planning to enroll at Evergreen this fall, following his role model, dela Cuesta.\r\n\r\nThe fact that dela Cuesta is still alive, let alone pursuing a college education, would stun a lot of people back home in Oahu, Hawaii.\r\n\r\nHis hard road began at age 9, when he saw his mother get gunned down in their home. The killing sent him into a string of foster homes. As a young man, he lived on the beach, using cocaine and plotting crimes.\r\n\r\nHe became a gangster, he says.\r\n\r\nThe death of his fiance to thyroid cancer jolted him into trying to leave the \"madness\" behind. He moved to the mainland in 1996, but he couldn\'t shake his drug habit.\r\n\r\nA Seattle pastor persuaded him to try the New Vision program. He relapsed after his first treatment, but says he\'s been clean since re-entering the program in November 1999.\r\n\r\nSurprising himself with his success, dela Cuesta enrolled at Seattle Central and earned an associate in arts degree in information technology.\r\n\r\nRelying on a patchwork of student aid, he began studying last year at Evergreen, where he\'s seeking a bachelor\'s in social services. He wants to \"help youths -- kids in my predicament -- to show them there is a way out.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland and dela Cuesta single out one New Vision counselor -- Deryl Davis-Bell -- for inspiring them to go to college.\r\n\r\nDavis-Bell knew firsthand what it would take for them to get an education. He now works as an outreach worker for Seattle Vision Youth.\r\n\r\nHe made it from Seattle Central to the University of Washington and earned a master\'s in social work, but that success came only after he bottomed out in 1990, arrested on a drug charge. He now encourages troubled men to seek an education and set goals, if only to help them overcome their shame.\r\n\r\n\"To me, it\'s always looking forward and realizing that my life has meaning,\" he says. \"My life is meant to affect others in a positive way. If I only focus on my own troubles, then I\'m not looking a the whole picture.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland and dela Cuestra feel a need to give something back. Dela Cuesta was active in student government at Seattle Central, and both have served as volunteer social workers and mentors.\r\n\r\nThey\'re the latest sources of inspiration for New Vision, says Robinson, the director.\r\n\r\n\"I\'ll forever hold these guys up ... that this is what you can accomplish.\"', 'Promote role models that are ...', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2003-08-16 19:34:40', '2003-08-18 15:34:10', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

At the other end, there is information that empowers people and gets people to think independently and creatively (bottom up). The medical establishment in the US follows the expert opinion model. Most Public Health information reinforces this same model. Health information acts on the public, not with the public. Top down communication re-enforces dependency on expert medical opinion. Ultimately, preserving the top down approach also preserves the status quo.', 'Reciprocal information and education should be the cornerstones of medical practice and public health. This idea reflects back to Participatory Design #298 and Participatory Design of Information Infrastructures #115, where involvement of all participants at all levels of study and communication are outlined. In the introduction of a Pattern Language, a process that moves away from professional architects, or expert opinion is encouraged.', 'When patients come into a medical clinic they are given, at the most, a few minutes to voice their concerns. Medical practitioners are encouraged to limit patient discussion to one problem by clinic managers, the HMO they work for or other business concerns. The easiest way to limit dialog, and thus save time, is to not allow any. The medical practitioner may use language that people do not understand (medical jargon), body language that does not invite dialog, and interruption of the patients speech to control the visit. \r\nExpert opinion is the public face of a \"formal system\", such as the biomedical establishment, which invalidates lived experience or the informal system. The contradiction expert opinion raises is that people need it as much as it distorts concerns. Illness requires more than self-care. Alexander\'s book serves as a template to balance the need for specialized, professional knowledge and the incorporation of non-expert knowledge. Collaboration, rather than one-way teaching should be the preferred model. Each side should must learn something from the other. \r\nMuch public health research and health information follows the one-way model of expert opinion. Research is carried out with little if any input from the population it hopes to improve the health of. The reasons for this are many times budgetary, reflecting the social nature of how knowledge is created. Experts become inadvertently spokespeople for a style or topic of research because of their dependency on institutions.  Needs assessments are expensive. Trust between researchers and the lay public is both time consuming and difficult to build. Building an equal partnership requires that control is taken away from the expert. Funding follows the political climate of the times.\r\nSocial science research, unlike natural science research, examines intangible relationships. It examines power, meaning and the creation of knowledge as part of a cultural system. It should question the status-quo. Indeed, controversy created by social science research is the mark of a truly democratic system, where expert opinion is openly questioned (1). \r\nIn the spirit of Alexander\'s work, knowledge of health, like architecture, is a collaboration of various types of knowledge both expert and lay, Western and non-Western, abstract and lived.', 'The purpose of health care information must be critically examined. Public Health information must be honestly assessed as to where and how information was derived and to whom it is being disseminated. It must address the true needs of the public, not the perception of needs by the medical expert.

Much of this information depicts good health in terms of vigilance against the failings of our own bodies. This serves to create dependency on a high tech, commodity health system.', 'The style of language and the content of information are very important in how information makes people perceive the world. Authors in many fields have noted patterns of communication that create distrust and enforce dependency by emphasizing danger from external, uncontrollable forces. If people have a sense of helplessness in the face of this threat, they do not act upon their own feelings and perceptions.', 'Negative language has the effect of emphasizing threats, magnifying fears, and creating dependency. Reminding people of their mortality tends to make them hold more closely to traditional culture (Pyszczynski, Solomon, & Greenberg, 2003); this has implications for mental health, and can also be used to influence mass opinion and behavior. A recent example is the US administrations use of language to create fear and mistrust among the public by creating the specter of a constant external threat (Brooks, 2003). \r\n\r\nMuch health information, especially advertising from hospital corporations and pharmaceutical companies, uses this technique. A paternalistic (doctor knows best) and commodity-driven medical system produces an endless stream of information that encourages the perception that natural processes, such as growing older or pregnancy, are fraught with danger. This inhibits the spread of health information that is not based on the treatments that this system has to offer.\r\n\r\nLanguage may not only be negative; it can also be empty (Brooks, 2003); complex issues are broken down into broad statements with little meaning. In health care information, this pattern of communication places the cause of ill health on the individual. The complexity of individuals relationships to the world they live in and the effects on individual health of pollution, poverty, and unhealthy social norms and values are ignored. People come to construe healthy behavior in terms of dependency on a medical industry that constantly invents not only new cures, but new diseases for the cures it already possesses (Blech, 2006). \r\n\r\nEmpty language is like empty calories. It tastes good and you can eat a lot of it, but you dont obtain much benefit. A great deal of health information tempts us to feel that we are well-informed. We are bombarded by advertising and public health campaigns that do little more than create mistrust of the inherent healthy processes we possess. To reduce complex health issues to taking a pill ignores peoples emotional needs and the complex connection between body and mind; instead it emphasizes the negative aspects of their health. \r\n\r\nThe use of estrogen replacement in post-menopausal women illustrates this. Estrogen replacement was pushed on women as a way if combating the problems of growing old such as osteoporosis, heart disease, memory loss and drying skin. The unspoken message was that there was something wrong with growing old that taking medication could correct it. Preventative approaches, that emphasized a lifetime of healthy behaviors and the inherent correctness of aging, were ignored.\r\n\r\nIn pattern 47, Health Center, Alexander et al. (1977) describe a medical system that emphasizes sickness over health. By contrast, they show the Pioneer Health Center in Peckham, an experiment from the 1930s, as an example of medical care that focuses on health instead of sickness. In the same manner, health information must distinguish between healing and medicine. We need to hear messages of what is right with us and what needs to be done to stay in touch with the inherent health of our bodies.\r\n\r\nMany alternative health practices, such as yoga, polarity treatment, or acupuncture focus on the inherent healthiness of the body. In these practices, the underlying concept is on healing, the natural process by which the body repairs itself. The rise of alternatives to conventional medicine reflects, in part, the lack of substance people feel from the information they receive after a visit to a doctor. Health-related discussion forums, that include both lay and professional perspectives but avoid the disease-mongering (Marshall & Aldhous, 2006) influence of industry funding, offer a way to make sense of information from various health related sources without falling victim to negative language and information; people put information into the context of everyday life and validate positive perceptions of themselves. This type of information has substance to it, not only because it is active rather than passive; it has the positive effect of engaging people in independent, creative thinking.', 'Health information should emphasize the idea that people are inherently healthy. It must inspire trust in the bodys ability to heal itself, once a healthy path has been taken.

Health information is needed for people without access to high tech, expensive medical coverage (health insurance). Health information must exist in a historical and political context.\r\nLack of access to medical care and a growing incidence of chronic, non-infectious diseases affects a significant segment of the population in the US. High tech medical treatments, which help with curing or treating symptoms rather than the cause, are not affordable for this population. Information is needed that focuses on prevention, is pragmatic and easily applicable.', 'Economic necessity may force many people to stop relying on expensive problem focused health care. How do people take care of themselves in a culture where self-reliance is not emphasized in mainstream health information? Many of the approaches that are used in Where There is No Doctor or older editions of Our Bodies Ourselves offer health care approaches that are practical and incorporate looking at the social causes of ill health. These approaches can be used to explain the causes and treatments for the rising incidence of chronic, non-infectious health problems that people in the US have. This information needs to be directed to the user public, not to policy makers, academics or a highly educated elite. Information must be practical and presented within a historical and political context. \r\nThe use of the book, Where There Is No Doctor (1) is wide spread internationally. It provides a useful tool where no other is really available, for people living in areas where acute, infectious processes are more common. In the US, this approach needs to be adapted to treat diabetes, asthma and COPD. Instead of explaining the causes of diarrhea as in the picture above, a scenario can be created showing how typically American lifestyle choices create ill health. Paulo Freire calls this learning process Transformative Literacy. Codification is an element of this process that begins with a photograph or picture from a scene of the learners life. Codification represents a given dimension of reality as individuals live it, and this dimension is proposed for their analysis in a context other than that in which they live it.  The learners, rather than receive information about this or that fact, analyze aspects of their own existential experience represented in the codification. (2) \r\nThe Internet or other abstract forms of information sources may not be the best place for people to access this information. For this level of complex information, an impersonal source like the Internet, will not establish the trust and dialog needed for people to understand it. Examples of information sources that might be better suited for this level of information exchange are lay health workers. In Detroit, community members are trained to help families deal with asthma prevention and lead poisoning. Low cost techniques that help children control their asthma are taught to family caregivers. These techniques include learning about housing conditions that are harmful, procuring vacuum cleaners and smoking cessation. \r\n	 A critical awareness must be raised to move people away from being dependent on a medical system they cannot access. They must develop new behaviors based on an independent viewpoint that will maintain health.', 'Apply Transactional Theory to Internet learning.

They included many external factors, such as domestic violence and sexuality, which were not considered a part of health information in conventional medicine. Yet understanding how these factors affected daily living, allowed women to make changes for a better quality life.\r\nAntidepressants and stimulants are widely used medications. They allow people to perform better, to tolerate situations and conform to social norms that they perhaps would not be able to adapt to otherwise. However, an alternative definition might question whether these medications really promote health. \r\n Does being healthy mean simply adopting behaviors such as compliance? Compliance with a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) will allow a smoker to continue smoking without his/her ulcer acting up. Surgery will allow a heavy drinker to continue drinking, for a few years at least before his heart stops. Many people are grateful to be able to function productively in stressful family situations with the help of antidepressants. These medications keep them healthy. But many people are looking for something more profound. They are willing to work harder and dig deeper to come to more real and lasting changes that can result in a different state of living. \r\nHealth is a social norm that all people are capable of defining. Scientific research alone cannot define what health is. Alternative ways of defining health are important for people to access, not only to find information that will specifically address the types of solutions they are looking for, e.g., a non-drug method of controlling blood pressure but also to define what being healthy means.

Health discrepancies between rich and poor will not be solved through better access to information alone. Good food, less stress, clean air and water, and a life with a purpose will increase health and healthy behaviors. Real change to improve health comes from a shift away from acknowledging only expert clinical opinion and toward a real-world awareness of the effect of environment on health: a shift from passive diagnosis and treatment to active engagement with the causes of and solutions to health problems.', 'We are not, for the most part, born unhealthy. We become unhealthy. And even for those born unhealthy, a great deal of ill health may have been preventable. The campaign to find the cure for breast cancer is a good example of health information that neglects any causal connection between ill-health and the environment (in this instance, an environment which includes the use of estrogen in prescription medication), and ignores political or social change that might address environmental causes of the disease. This pattern of information, in which action comes only after the individual becomes ill but nothing has been done to prevent illness in first place, focuses on individual responsibility with no questioning of the established social order. The unspoken message is that breast cancer just happens. It is up to the individual to get involved with a screening program for early detection and treatment. Information on research that investigates environmental effects to the development of breast cancer is not part of mainstream health information.\r\n\r\nPublic health information about diabetes further illustrates the lack of emphasis on the connection between environment and health. Among Native Americans, diabetes (like most other non-infectious chronic diseases) was virtually unknown before World War II. Now, in some tribes, over 60% of adults have diabetes and the age of onset is decreasing with each generation. Much of the research on diabetes among Native Americans focuses on genetic causes or on molecular level differentiations of diabetic types. It gives short shrift to how the disruption in traditional diet and life style and the devaluation of traditional medicine correspond with the dramatic increase in the disease. The connection of indigenous people to the environment that they come from, the types of foods they eat, and activities they perform to prepare those foods are not considered an active component in their health. Diabetic health information focuses on what the individual can do to access mainstream diets and medicine. It does not validate traditional knowledge that prevented diabetes in the past, and ignores how the community as a whole can work together to recreate that knowledge. This does not mean trying to reestablish life as it was 60 years ago, but it does mean putting the current problem in a holistic context that includes history, indigenous knowledge, the interaction between diet and environment, and reasons for lack of access even to non-traditional healthy food.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, John Snow removed the handle from a London neighborhood water pump that was located a few feet from a sewer (\"John Snow Pub,\" 2006). He believed that this sewage was causing the epidemic of cholera deaths in the neighborhood. Epidemiology textbooks emphasize Snow\'s connection of cause and effect as the first public health intervention of the modern era. They ignore an analysis of cause: industrialization and dislocation, poverty, over-crowding etc. What options for water did people in the neighborhood have without the pump? Seldom mentioned is that, due to the demand of a thirsty public, the handle was replaced six weeks after its removal.\r\n\r\nPublic health programs must include methods to share power with communities they hope to help. What are the contributors to ill health in their communities? What are the barriers to good health that the communities identify? Information needs to realistically address what is within the control of the individual and what will take groups of people working together to solve. Methods to improve health in disadvantaged communities must reflect the larger social change and shift in power needed.\r\n\r\nHealth information such as Fast Food Nation (Schlosser, 2002) needs to be the norm, not the exception. This book chronicles the entire environment that produces fast food, including social norms and values. Similarly, the documentary film Life and Debt (www.lifeanddebt.org) shows the destruction of healthy, local food production in Jamaica by the combination of multinational food businesses and international government policy.\r\n\r\nHealth information needs to do more than simply inform. What does not question the present state of affairs will not, for example, bring affordable nutritious food to poor neighborhoods. Nor will it create safe neighborhoods in areas where children cannot exercise. Better access to information may improve health care decisions to some extent; unless it also generates momentum and optimism for social change then it simply perpetuates a focus on individual behavior and treatment of symptoms that have already occurred. Health information needs to look honestly at the conditions that cause ill health, and engage not only those who suffer illness but the entire social and regulatory apparatus that can play a role in improving the conditions that people live in.', 'Demand and produce health information that identifies environmental and social causes of ill-health.

It ranges from the slick, professional web pages for every new drug on the market to grass-roots chat groups. Trying to sort out this plethora of information on the Internet as to what is beneficial or accurate can be very difficult. To facilitate this, reliability assessment needs to be further developed as a part of health care information. Students in conventional medical professional schools are taught to view medical literature critically, assessing the statistical methods used, the intent of the authors, who sponsored the study, and if the outcome is plausible. The general public needs to have similar tools for assessing health information.', 'Medical literature should be read from a critical stance. In an attempt to create a more equal balance for decision making, physicians (and other health professionals) may present a variety of treatment options a patient can choose from. Patients are expected to know enough about these options to make their own choices but the reality is, many times patients are simply not in a position to make these assessments. Not only do people not have the medical knowledge base, they also have not been trained to look at a health care decision from a perspective that pulls in many different social aspects that effect health. \r\nBy examining health information from a perspective that places a problem or decision in the complete context of a persons life, reliability of the information can be assessed by the general public. There is a need to educate people beyond the individual effects of causality, to get beyond the conservative perspective of presenting information that describes problems and solutions in a simplistic, isolated manner. In conservative  (or scientific) thinking, issues are broken down into minute parts that have no interconnection. The historical and political realities that create the environment that medical problems exist in, are not considered relevant or to even exist. This is how health information is usually presented. By placing this information into a relevant context, the general public can assess reliability. People will then be able to answer questions for themselves: Does this relate to me? Does this fit into my life experience? Answering these questions help determine reliability of the information.\r\nBesides putting information into a social perspective, the bias of the authors must be acknowledged. In Where There is No Doctor (1) a variety of treatments for common ailments are presented, both western and folk medicine, which the author considers harmful or ineffective. These opinions are the authors, but their bias is transparent. The author has made clear what their perspective is and the reader can make their own opinions accordingly. In the US, commercial interests distort much of the information people receive on health. The bias of this information is not transparent. An example of this is the official food pyramid produced by the USDA. Due to pressure from the dairy and meat industry, revisions of the pyramid placing meat and dairy products in a less favorable, but more healthy position, are not accepted (2). \r\nPatterns of information reliability assessment already takes place in lay medical chat groups. Discussion focuses on sorting out the reliability of information received from various sources such as medical professionals, direct to patient advertising, friends, family, and social networks that supply information support. Another common technique to establish reliability in chat groups is validation. For example, the discussion of a side effect that has been dismissed by a medical professional can get verification online from another patient or health care professional with a similar experience. Reliability assessment needs to be further developed as a part of health care information.', 'Reliability of the source, attitudes of the information source and the motivation of the author of the advice are all important considerations that people must consider when assessing health information.

Women who are in abusive relationships are blamed as being individually responsible for their situation. They are also blamed for ignoring the good advise to leave their current situation, if they choose not to do so. As the author explains, what is ignored is the larger context these women live in. Self-reliance, self-confidence and the economic ability to live independently have been denied by a patriarchal system. Instead of looking at the entire situation the patient lives in, the advice of the medical professional is held up as a logical, scientific solution, ignoring the systematic causes of the situation in the first place. When the individual cannot overcome these barriers, it is the individual, not the barriers, that gets implicated.\r\nA similar situation exists to people who contract HIV because of life styles that include self destructive behaviors.

People benefit by being able to perceive reality in new ways and to solve problems more creatively. \r\nOne definition of traditional or indigenous medicine is medical practices that are based on oral methods of passing information from one generation to the next. Some traditional medicines are based on thousands of years of observations. However, the legitimacy of oral traditions is suspect until proven by scientific method. Edward Jenner is credited with discovering the vaccination for small pox in much the same way Columbus is credited with discovering the American continent. Milkmaids knew that once they had cow pox, they were protected them from getting sick with small pox. It was their knowledge, based on generations of observation and oral teaching, that Jenner used for his work. The legitimacy of the oral tradition is dismissed as a quaint folk tradition and Jenner is credited as the inventor of vaccinations in health textbooks. The flow of information in this historical example is not acknowledged as being reciprocal.\r\n	Another example of one-way information flows is the form that information takes. The internet is an abstract form of information. Not all health information can be conveyed to all people in this one form. Health information that is based on observation and conveyed by oral methods does not adapt well to a world dominated by abstraction and a reductionist scientific method. Users of the internet are generally readers. Other traditions however, can be accommodated through digital photography and videos. This type of information sharing, between abstract and oral or visual forms can be facilitated if both forms are given equal legitimacy. There must be equal respect for knowledge that does not arise from a western, scientific methodology and also, for cultures that do not traditionally obtain information through abstract forms. The categorical denial of any other approach or perception of health and illness denies vast numbers of people useful ways of living.\r\n	Allowing only one type of system to dominate concepts of health is similar to mono-cropping in agriculture. One perspective cannot be adjusted to all situations globally. Biomedicine, for example, approaches problems from a cultural perspective.

Alternatives to corporate media exist of course, but the audiences are substantially smaller; the alternatives generally have lower \"production values\" (due to fewer resources) and are much harder to find.  Consequently they are enjoyed only by the more intrepid among us.  People and organizations who struggle to interject alternative messages into the public consciousness via the media &mdash; even with paid ads &mdash; will be soundly rebuffed. For example, the AdBusters Foundation has repeatedly attempted to get their \"Buy Nothing\" piece aired on television in the US. only to be turned down by the major networks.  MoveOn\'s \"Bush in 30 Seconds\" was also rejected by the networks. Environmental organizations have trouble getting their messages aired but corporate ads on the same themes are aired without questions.', 'When access to media is blocked...', 'Until fairly recently, it was a commonly held notion in the United States that \"the people owned the airwaves.\" Although that notion has apparently vanished from the minds  of many politicians and government regulators, people periodically reassert this right when other routes have failed. \r\n\r\nWith few exceptions, access to media is generally blocked to citizen and, especially, alternative viewpoints. The choices of media often boil down to state-run media (often propaganda) or purely commercial (or a combination of the two) or none at all.\r\n\r\nIn the US particularly but in other countries as well people are bombarded with images and ideas that are generally cut from the same cloth. Whether news, \"reality\" shows, police dramas, talk shows, or commercials television is a seamless and impenetrable wall that is assiduously protected from invasion. Media Intervention is one tactic to fight this particular and ubiquitous form of censorship. In this case, the media truly is the message: while the content itself is commercialistic, addicting, intellectually and psychologically (and emotionally?  and politically?) stultifying (debilitating?), the sheer immensity and second order effects of the media as a societal phenomenon make it impossible to ignore. It\'s a problem for everyone when the \"vast wasteland\" grows vaster. \r\n\r\nMedia intervention comes in many guises and new approaches are devised fairly frequently. There are vast differences in the ways that this pattern is employed &mdash; all the way from the most polite and prescribed to the most overt and officially prohibited.

He attended a televised Mariner\'s baseball game with a sign that was adorned with the number of Mariner star player, Ichiro Suzuki, and some writing in Kanji. Unbeknownst to  the non-Japanese speakers at the game and, in particular, the people who were televising the game who captured Sill and the sign that he enthusiastically brandished whenever Ichiro was at bat, the Kanji on one side read, \"President Bush is a monkey\'s butt\" which was complemented on the other side with the claim that \"Americans are ashamed of their corrupt president\" (Jenniges, 2003). \r\n\r\nIn the late 1990\'s, the Barbie Liberation Organization engineered a similarly clever caper which ultimately was covered with bemusement on the television evening news in a number of U.S. cities. The intervention began with the purchase of several ultra-feminine \"Barbie\" dolls and the ultra-masculine \"G.I. Joes\" \"action figures\" (not <i>dolls</i>). Back in their secret laboratory, the BLO surgically altered the dolls, performing a gender swap (or \"correction\" as they called it) of the voice boxes of the two stereotypical avatars. Then the dolls were repackaged and placed (\"reverse shoplifting\") on various toy store shelves around the country where they were purchased by unsuspecting shoppers. Back at home, the young recipients of the dolls were surprised when the he-man Joe professed a love for shopping while the wire-thin Barbie newly masculinized wanted to \"take the next hill\" presumably with a hail of hot lead. One intriguing postscript was that at least some of the recipients of the transformed doll/action figure preferred the new version to the old. \r\n\r\nFinally, the techniques of (1) trying hard to get one\'s issue injected into the media and (2) <i>disciplining</i> the media for content that people find objectionable (and, less frequently, <i>praising</i> the media for appropriate coverage), form the traditional \"bread and butter\" core of this pattern and are not expected to go away or lose their importance in the face of the other approaches discussed earlier. \r\n\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"http://www.actupny.org/divatv/netcasts/news_zap_animation.gif\"><br>NY Act Up Activists Make an Unscheduled Visit to the CBS Evening News.<br />More information can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.actupny.org/divatv/indexN.html\">http://www.actupny.org/divatv/indexN.html</a></center>', 'Sometimes it  becomes necessary to intervene in the media to nudge it into new avenues that it might not have taken without the intervention.

People must sometimes <i>take to the streets</i> to visibly express their dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nLarge public demonstrations are probably the most overt form of protest.  It is hard to deny the reality of thousands, tens or hundreds of thousands of people, in the streets peacefully marching, with banners and signs, music, costumes, noisemakers and other devices that have been spontaneously and individually designed. Though often portrayed in the media as marginal and/or dangerous, mass demonstrations (such as those in the Ukraine in December 2004) are generally peaceful and, indeed, suitable for the whole family. As a matter of fact, the presence of families and older people helps ensure that the demonstrations are peaceful. Through their visibility, they also help to legitimize the protest by showing that the concerns aren\'t limited to one  demographic use, youths, for example. \r\n\r\nIn February, 2003, the world witnessed the largest expression of this pattern in history. People gathered in over 600 ciites in over 40 countries worldwide to protest the invasion of Iraq by the world\'s only superpower. Although the Bush administration was undeterred by this unprecedented display of disapproval, the idea of peace as an ideal was brought forward by civil society worldwide and held aloft as a universal idea &mdash; one that citizens must not allow governments to pursue &mdash; or ignore &mdash; according to their own calculations and motivations. \r\n\r\nMass peaceful demonstrations don\'t take place in a vacuum.  They need to be tied to broader strategy. This often involves engaging with the media and with established governing (or intermediating) entities. It is often helpful to have a clear set of demands. Finally, although this doesn\'t always happen, measures like gathering names and contact information can be used to help build a large activist network that persists beyond the duration of the protest itself. \r\n<blockquote><blockquote><em>I was dreaming in my dreaming\r\nOf an aspect bright and fair\r\nAnd my sleeping it was broken\r\nBut my dream it lingered near\r\nIn the form of shining valleys\r\nWhere the pure air recognized\r\nAnd my senses newly opened\r\nI awakened to the cry\r\nThat the people / have the power\r\nTo redeem / the work of fools\r\nUpon the meek / the graces shower\r\nIts decreed / the people rule</em>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Patti Smith, \"The People Have the Power\"\r\n</blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<center><object width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/bCn-mpXZZps&rel=1\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/bCn-mpXZZps&rel=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"></embed></object></center>\r\n<font size=\"-3\">I think that the photograph of the demonstration in Los Angeles (early 2003) against the US invasion of Iraq used above is from a web site that helped promote the worldwide peace demonstrations.</font>', 'Peaceful, mass public demonstrations both large and small, in combination with other forms of dissent are sometimes necessary.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2003-11-10 15:46:18', '2008-02-04 22:56:01', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

However, relying to heavily on one form of organizing tool can leave people alienated from the issues effecting them. For example, many groups have chosen to focus solely on door to door organizing, and telephone campaigns.  Though \"face to face\" neighborhood organizing may be most preferential it is not always the most viable.  It can be a slow and costly process resulting in only a handful of citizens being prompted to action over a relatively long -time frame. Using online tools can speed the process and facilitate in the necessary information reaching as many people as possible.', 'For years activist and community organizations have relied heavily on the distribution of information for the purpose of prompting community action from mail, to telephone, and of course door to door community outreach. Despite relative effectiveness in creating movements across the country we still have seen a dangerous lapse between the speed of corporate and government descision making, and the citizens\' ability to organize and voice concern about these decisions. The ability to get the information and speak out in response weather in support or opposition is vital to our democratic process, and is necessary for a more participatory approach to creating the society we want as citizens.', 'During the 1960s the United States witnessed a social upheaval as citizen response to the Vietnam War grew in vehement opposition, but that response wasn\'t witnessed overnight. It took several years before the opposition took hold of the American mainstream. Despite seeing young soldiers die daily on the TV screen, the call to action was slow in appearance. The communication tools of the day were mainly relegated to flyers and telephone campaigns to seek the support of anti-war demonstrators around the country. Though effective once the campaign ball began to roll it took an enormous amount of effort to build up the necessary momentum to carry it nationwide.  Though the citizen action organized by these various methods worked it took longer than many would have hoped. \r\nIn light of the relatively recent advances in technology new tools in the attempt to create strong community organization have emerged. Tools like e-mail list-serves, message boards, chat and instant messengers, visual and audio data transfer, all of which add a new dimension to the work of connecting people around issues. Within the last 5 years we have seen an explosion in electronic tools being utilized for the purpose of community organizing. This sudden race to jump on the band wagon has come about because these tools work well. The most notable and apparent outcomes of this kind of organizing can be seen in the \"No-Iraq War\" protests that were held world wide. Millions of people conversed through electronic methods to reach their goals, much of which was done mainly through e-mail. People were able to enhance there connections and mobilize quickly in the face of the impending war, rather than being in the dark for months, even years before the citizens response could be heard. If these tools had not been utilized in the ways they were during the months preceding the protests most of us would have still been in the dark.', 'It is imperative that as activists, community organizers, and average concerned citizens that all available tools are brought to bear in the attempt to facilitate the mobilization of concerted community action.

These applications are dynamic and interactive lending themselves to be used in a wide variety of situations. They are fast, relatively easy to use, and comparatively cheap in cost. How do we know this? Because these tools show themselves best when they are put to the test in real live situations. As they get more use in situations that require timing and quick organization we will see these tools only help to add solidarity weather it be local or global.\r\nThrough adding  more outlets for communication we open up the ability of carrying information and reaching more people than ever dreamed.

Performing \"missions\" involves talking to an NPC or going to a mission terminal and getting the coordinates of some particularly tough creature to go kill for a set monetary reward. Usually at some point, the player becomes strong enough (after days and days of play and after killing thousands of creatures) to fight other players. \r\nPlayers die frequently in MMPORGs, only to be instantly resurrected back at a temple or a cloning station (depending on the genre of the game) with a minor penalty to their wealth. \r\nMost MMPORGs have some sort of game economy, that works as players buy and sell weapons or resources. Some have merchant or healer classes-- characters able to create items from raw resources, or heal wounded characters. Though these professions offer a break from the monotony of mass-murder, these roles are still peripheral to the main thrust of the game, that is, \"the more you kill, the more powerful you become.\" The are relegated to support roles to the fighters.\r\nThe psychological effect of immersion in these violent fantasies is still difficult to gauge, though many players become self-described \"addicts\" of the game, investing a good percentage of their waking hours.

At the same time, many issues that play out at the local level also have a global context.', '<blockquote>The World Social Forum is an open meeting place for reflective thinking, democratic debate of ideas, formulation of proposals, free exchange of experiences and interlinking for effective action, by groups and movements of civil society that are opposed to neoliberalism and to domination of the world by capital and any form of imperialism, and are committed to building a planetary society directed towards fruitful relationships among Humankind and between it and the Earth. &mdash Principle 1, <i>World Social Forum Charter of Principles</i></blockquote>By offering a \"big tent\" setting such as the World Social Forum (WSF) where these groups can come together, synergy can happen and solutions to social programs can be developed.  The basic idea is that the Social Forums, like parties or conferences or other gatherings, provide an occasion for people of similar interests to get together. What people choose to do with the information is ultimately a decision that they will make. But, by the same token, the forums do what they can to make the events successful in the sense of spawning collaborative and collective actions and projects <i>without</i> heavy-handed \"social engineering.\" The Big Tent pattern encourages other smaller tents (with, for example, regional or thematic focus) to form within the event and these \"smaller tents\" can ultimately provide issue and geographical \"space\" to support the work of additional groups with other forums.   \r\n\r\nThe big tent scale of the World Social Forum and the growth (starting with 20,000 in 2001 and up to 100,000 in 2005) has helped foster respect from mainstream media and other entities that may be seen as oppositional to the Forum principles, as it demonstrates that this is real, and there are large numbers of people and organizations that are committed to working on these issues.  Another positive attribute of this pattern of a large gathering of many social issue groups for mobilization is that the scale is big enough that individuals can participate and be somewhat anonymous, which can reduce the pressure to represent a certain group ideology and allow more freedom to express alternatives, to listen and to learn.\r\n\r\nConceived as an counterforce to the elite World Economic Forum held annually in Davos, Switzerland, the World Social Forum picks up where the 1999 demonstrations against the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle left off by providing the setting for activists to create alternatives to corporate dominance.  The economic agenda was not the only issue discussed at the World Social Forum when it was held in Mumbai, India in 2004. Government repression (in Burma, for example) was examined in workshops and demonstrations as was discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation or caste. The presence of Dalits, the \"untouchables\" at the bottom of India\'s elaborate (and technically illegal) caste system, was a reminder that basic human rights are far from universal. Regional issues like so-called \"honor killings\" and dowry practices were also discussed as were the rights of children. Jabala, a group that works with children in red light districts led a rally with the chant: \"Aloo becho, machchi becho, par bachchon ko mat becho\" (\"sell potatoes, sell fish but don\'t sell children\"). Thousands of children are inducted into the sex industry every year.\r\n\r\nThroughout the four day gathering, labor groups, human rights advocates, antiwar campaigners and many others conducted boisterous processions accompanied by dancing, sign-brandishing, and drumming. Along with rallies, films, and photography exhibits, delegates had organized scores of workshops, seminars, information sharing sessions and debates. Delegates from over 130 countries discussed strategies, areas of mutual concerns and opportunities for collaborations based on newly discovered linkages between issues. \r\nWe have used the World Social Forum as the main example of this pattern because it is the most prominent meeting of this type in the world. It has shown itself to be replicable &mdash; at least so far &mdash; in its totality as a <i>World</i> Social Forum, but, also, in a variety of constituent regional and thematic fora. Although not all \"big tents\" are required to adopt the tenets of the World Social Forum, two of its principles may be useful if you are considering the idea of convening Big Tent events.\r\n\r\nThe first principle is that the Forum is an \"open meeting place\" or agora where issues are <i>raised</i>, not necessarily deliberated or used to directly plan actions. The second principle is that power is not intended to reside within the organizational structure of the WSF. The governing body of the WSF, for example, is prohibited from making statements in the name of the WSF. Also, the original \"Charter of Principles states that  the WSF \"does not constitute a locus of power to be disputed by  participants in its meetings.\" While both of these ideas are designed to forestall certain problems, they ironically raise other types of challenges or tensions within the WSF community. One of these is related to action vs. talk orientation, with the action-oriented people saying that after seven years it is now time for an action agenda. Another objection is related to participation vs. elitism. Although most events are organized by participants, some plenary events are generally convened and these are likely to populated by \"star\" activists. \r\n\r\nOne certainly has a better understanding of the enormity of the world\'s problems after attending a \"big tent\" event like the World Social Forum. On the other hand, one cannot help but feel some cautious optimism as well.

Network gamers engaged in hacking, moding and skinning video games are natural transdisciplinary knowledge workers. Modding is the act of creating new levels, objects, or systems for a game, or building an entirely new game using engines from other games; skinning is the act of retexturing characters, objects, or environments (Pearce).\r\n\r\nJohn Seely Brown, former chief scientist of Xerox Corporation, obseves that the wired generationchildren who grew up with the network as a primary form of socializationhave shifted from linear deductive reasoning to Renaissance, lateral, bricolage (jack of all trades) reasoning (Brown, 2003). Additionally, US Army studies indicate that the learning styles, skills, and attitudes of this generation are different from its predecessors (Macedonia, n.d.). According to Macedonia and the US Army, characteristics of the wired generation include:\r\n Multiprocessing, the ability to perform several tasks concurrently.\r\n Attention span variation resembling senior executives exhibiting fast context switching.\r\n Information navigation changes that define literacy not only as text but also as images and multimedia.\r\n Shift in focus of learning from passive listening to discovery-based experiential and example-based learning.\r\n Shift in type of reasoning from deductive and abstract to the concrete.\r\n Intelligence organized in easily accessible databases.\r\n Communities of practice emerging from shared tasks.\r\n\r\nNetwork gamers are both consumers and producers of digital content; they also are learners and teachers. At the Austin Gaming Expo, a well-attended, annual game convention targeting consumers, we surveyed 62 gamers for their level of involvement in game development, learning, self-organizing communities of practice, and innovation networks. We asked, Which of the following formal or informal game development efforts are you involved with? Of the 62 respondents, 45.2% answered that they were not involved in any of these activities. However, of those surveyed who were involved, hacking games to learn ranked highest, followed closely by providing feedback to game companies.\r\n\r\nConsumer Experience in Game Development\r\n\r\nIMAGE\r\n\r\nSee: games-nano-bio-info-cogno-envro:\r\nHow Digital Gaming Connects 21st Century Science, Education and Workforce\r\nhttp://www.txstate.edu/nac/documents/brazell.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nNetwork gamers involved in these activities as a community of practice form an identity and are bound together by a shared sense of purposesolving complex problems related to creating or modifying virtual worlds. It is essentially a creative process where gamers learn by doing. Network game teams who mod and construct games often straddle learning and commercializationa key aspect of transdisciplinarity. The process of modifying a game is in effect social construction of knowledge and technology. This is characterized as self-organizing innovation networks:\r\n\r\n [self-organizing] innovation networks provide artifacts with the design of visions of usage and subject them to the learning processes [] In this sense the production and application of new technologies is no longer a process of trial and\r\nHow Digital Gaming Connects 21st Century Science, Education and Workforce error involving variation and selection but, rather, a coordinated process of learning and designing by producers and users [] Research into the genesis of technology focuses on the role of collective actors who combine technical variation and selection within technology production, which no longer can be equated with the construction of artifacts. Instead, it involves the anticipation and construction of new contexts of application [] This new conceptualization of innovation within a net replaces biological principles of variation and selection used in evolutionary economics with social construction, that is, the construction of new artifacts and new contexts of application. (Kuppers)\r\n\r\nIn this constructivist process, gamers learn by fusing artistic, scientific and engineering techniques in order to create new games, new game levels, new game art and in some cases new applications for games within non-entertainment markets. It is the application of gaming technologies and skills to non-game markets, problems, research questions and technologies that is most compelling in the context of 21st Century science, education and workforce issues.\r\n\r\nSelf Organizing Innovation Networks for Gaming R&D\r\n\r\nIMAGE\r\n\r\nSee: games-nano-bio-info-cogno-envro:\r\nHow Digital Gaming Connects 21st Century Science, Education and Workforce\r\nhttp://www.txstate.edu/nac/documents/brazell.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nFormal analysis of the video game industry indicates that game design includes art, informatics, production and business domains, however, the majority of employers consider: knowledge skills and abilities in multiple disciplines; ability to integrate scientific and artistic concepts and ability to communicate and work effectively in multidisciplinary teams important to critically important.\r\nFunctional Domains of Commercial Game Production\r\nSource: IC2 Institute\r\n\r\nThe practice of fusing artistic, scientific and engineering techniques is not new, however, the unification of R&D and production is novel. As it relates to the game industry, outside of major game publishers and major console manufacturers, the game industry is not typically-characterized as research-intensive. R&D is usually addressed through game development projects. The mutual reinforcement of R&D and production accelerates innovation in the industry. Game developers constantly push technological boundaries through unified production and R&D. We term this process production R&D. Production R&D is the transdisciplinary process of real-time learning, adaptation, and innovation within the context of production.\r\n\r\nDisney, Pixar and Industrial Light and Magic are exemplars of this transdisciplinary process. Walt Disneys Imagineering is perhaps the best known and most successful model. Disneys Imagineering is the master planning, creative development, design, engineering, production, project management and research and development arm of The Walt Disney Company. The dotcom creator-type companies that emerged between 1995-2000 also used this concept of unified R&D and production. Interestingly, the global network game youth culture exhibits these traits of real-time learning, adaptation, and innovation within the context of hacking, modding and skinning games. For these communities of practice; work, learning, and play are one.', 'Educational programs, economic development initiatives and workforce programs should recognize the relationship between the popular youth culture of network gaming, the needs of 21st-Century Science and the pressing need for new engineering and science-related teachers, executives and R&D professionals. Like gaming, 21st-Century Science needs whole brain, adaptive leaders able to cope and even flourish in uncertain, complex situations requiring fusion of traditional academic disciplines and effective human collaboration in network environments. Game-related learning and production are transdisciplinary, and the learning and workforce needs of the game industry reflect the structure and needs of 21st-Century Science.\r\n\r\nGaming and 21st-Century Science are related in the following ways:\r\n Underlying mathematics, modeling, and computer technologies are similar or the same.\r\n Cybernetics and systemics are essential.\r\n Emergence of a distinct culture and practice.\r\n Real-time learning, adaptation, and innovation within the context of productionproduction R&D.\r\n Highly adaptive teams exhibiting the formation of new language, tools, and processes.\r\n High rate of innovation and resulting disclosure of new knowledge, technologies and techniques (Disclosing New Worlds, Flores).\r\n High variety of academic disciplines and experiences of team members.\r\n Similar workforce and education requirements.\r\n Driving a confluence of other related industries, processes, and technologies.\r\n Market and technology disruptions representing qualitative leaps over existing science, technology and economies of scale and use.\r\n Require unification of learning, R&D and commercialization.\r\n Transdisciplinary by nature.\r\n\r\nGamers represent a bridge to the types of learning systems and creativity needed to cope with the increased velocity of new scientific and technical knowledge flooding the world. It is time for us to take transdisciplinary action. We must recognize the unity of all things and be able to live with the requisitionwe must learn as we do!\r\n\r\nNote  This document is based on the Digital Game Forecast.

There is another LIGHT, all sages and poets have sung praises to, as scientists have discovered and... forgotten. It is Cosmic Life, the Force or Genetic Message, which gives life to the Eternal Organic Universe, which involves many possible matrices, each having its proper time. The Force is not science fiction; it is what physicists call \"Electroweak\", our human eyes cannot see, but our bodies can feel, as love, eros, emotions... \r\n\r\nWhat we call \"human history\" is just a Season or phase, cosmic Winter, which has lasted 13 thousand years and is now going to finish.

It is actually a quantum story, which also involves people coming from other planets and stars, besides the two main species, Humans and Reptilians, which have played the roles of protagonists in this planetary school, for millennia. The former represents the light, emotional side and the latter the dark rational one. They are both necessary to each other.\r\n\r\nCosmic Life has designed the planetary school, that is also a genetic laboratory, to make each of us evolve. The goal is the \"New Adam\" that is \"son of man, cunning like a snake and innocent like a dove\" (quoted from the Gospels). And the \"New Adam\" is a new human species, which is self-conscious and joins Reptilians\' professional abilities and Humans\' emotional, creative ones. \r\n\r\nThe quantum story has also involved true \"aliens\" or rather \"alienated\" people, who have lost their own contact with Life... \"They\" possess the media and seem to rule the planet ...

(610, 590, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'ABSTRACT\r\nWelcome to The Digital City of Oikonomia.  Oikonomia is a digital place where digital citizens come together as community to have an effect on the character of their own future.  Oikonomia means to manage the household in a way that increases its use value to all members of the household over the long run.  If we expand the scope of household to include the larger community of the land, of shared values, resources, biomes, institutions, language, and history, we have a good definition of economics for community.\"1  The City of Oikonomia emphasizes the fact that digital citizens are real people with human needs.  The most basic of these is the need to protect the natural environment.  Oikonomia supports the basic tenants of community; nature, people, business, and government in addition to an action plan for the common good.  The City of Oikonomia is a digital place where economics for community can be advanced.\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nAristotle made a distinction between Oikonomia and another form of economy called Chrematistics.  Chrematistics is a branch of political economy relating to the manipulation of property and wealth to maximize the short-term monetary exchange value for the benefit of the owner.  The theory of wealth as measured by money.  Our modern world of Wall Street dedicated to making money is the purest form of Chrematistics.1  Chrematistics is based on exchange value which promotes insatiable materialistic need.  More is always better, accumulations is unlimited.  On the other hand Oikonomia is based on concrete use value that can be satisfied.  Accumulation is limited.  A sustainable conservation economy can exist that increases the use value of its resources to all members of the household over the long run.\r\nChrematistics has to do with the benefit of the individual.  Oikonomia has to do with the benefit to the whole of society.  Christopher Alexanders work in developing patterns was based on the premise that 90% of what we do as humans is the same.  While each person has their own individual human intricacies, this accounts for only about 10% of life.  Alexander worked to emphasize the parts of us that are the same instead of focusing on what is different.  Christopher Alexander says the problem is in coming to see that the whole is real.  We see this again in Aristotles notions of cause, material, efficient, formal, and final.  The material and final causes are concrete.  The task is to focus on what is real or concrete.\r\nChristopher Alexander also says the human experience is based on personal human feeling.  Each individual experiences the world through their own human feelings.  Our human feelings and human values play a large part in who we are.  If these human feelings are extracted out of us by an economy that only measures money, life becomes less meaningful.  True wealth is living capital that makes life worthwhile.4  As humans we need to be closely attached to our human values.\r\nThe Digital City of Oikonomia tries to solve this problem for the human experience.  The method for doing this is to create a digital system for individuals (households) to enter their personal financial pattern in to.  This financial pattern should include the individual human values and feelings of the person (household).  Through this digital system the personal financial patterns can begin interacting or do business together.  As individuals and households start interacting they can discern where they have mutual human values.  Based on these mutual human values, trust bridges will develop that allow the households to have stronger, more complex relationships.  These deeper relationships can be the seed crop for social change that improves our world.  Individuals and households will become empowered by the opportunity to participate in an economy based on their human values.  Gradually, new opportunities will open up that give the household or individual even further realization of what is meaningful to them in this world and their own lives.\r\nThrough a system of Oikonomia we can manage the household or society as a whole to increase its use value to all members of the household (society) over the long run.  A pattern developed by Eco-Trust gives us a framework upon which to build Oikonomia based on a conservations economy of social, natural, and economic capital.  The digital infrastructure will give household economies the opportunity to be connected to these three forms of capital based on their own human experience.  NOT A DREAM\r\nThe Digital City of Oikonomia is like a port city that thrives from its economics related to the water way.  The water way of Oikonomia is blue and milky with human kindness.  Over the waterway the heavens reach the earth and the earth reaches the heavens.\r\nHumankind comes together near the waterway and a common good is achieved through digital interaction.  The digital interaction leads to positive human interactions and our world improves on the Waterway of Human Kindness.  The preservation of natural resources is the most important component for creating a sustainable future for humanity.  The natural environment of the waterway is not destroyed by the digital environment. The digital environment is invisible except for a few seconds each night when the digital infrastructure twinkles like stars in the sky and reflects like fairy dust on the waterway in praise to our maker.  \r\nThis sounds like a dream but it is not.  This description of the Digital City of Oikonomia is an attempt to put a face on a virtual place.  Christopher Alexander calls this a topography which is rich and profound.  Topology depends on the intuition that the character of a multi-dimensional configuration R depends in some way on the system of those subsets of R which are connected.  If we give all the connected subsets the measure 1, and the remaining non-connected subsets the measure 0, then the sets of measure 1 establish the connectivity of R.  There are only two classes of sub regions  open and closed.  There are only two possible degrees of coherence, 0 if not connected, and 1 if connected.  The character of this configuration is given by the particular system of sub regions that are connected, and by the way these connected sub regions overlap and lie within each other.1  This topology gives cognitive dimensions to Oikonomia that allows us to imagine what The Digital City might be like. \r\nHowever, to truly understand where and how The Digital City of Oikonomia exists we must begin to understand what is real or concrete about it in a more complex way.  To do this we must learn to see that the whole is real.  The whole is concrete.  It is not an illusion, though we so often fail to see it.  The reason this happens is because the whole is neutral.  However, this is not like The Emperors New Cloths which were not real.  In its neutral state the whole is real.  The whole is unbroken and undivided.  In physics, the local behavior of an electron is affected by the larger configuration of the experiment in which it moves.  The local behavior of a gravitational particle is affected by the large-scale gravitational field that is created by the particles.1  Wholeness is the important thing: the local parts exist chiefly in relation to the whole, and their behavior and character and structure are determined by the larger whole in which they exist and which they create.1 The fundamental idea is that we can define wholeness exactly as a structure.1\r\nIn mathematical terms, Alexander defines the wholeness W as the system which is created by the region R, together with the measure (of life) c and all those subregions which have measure more than some threshold and thus qualify as centers.  The wholeness W is created by the interaction of the geometry of the region R and the rank order which is created on the centers of R by c.1  Wholeness is more general than the topology of a figure.  Wholeness has a powerful global character.  Alexander gives the example of four different self-portraits of the painter Henri Matisse.  The features in each drawing are very different.  Only the wholeness remains the same in every drawing.1  Though the features or the topology of each face is different it is still easy to see that it is Matisse.  The whole face of Matisse is real.  The whole is neutral, it simply exists.  The relative life of a given part is merely a consequence of the wholeness which exists.  Grasping an understanding of this wholeness is fundamental to realizing what is concrete and real.  Only by focusing on what is real and concrete through your cognitive understanding of this wholeness can you see a true picture of The Digital City of Oikonomia.\r\nDEVELOPING A REAL PICTURE\r\nThe digital infrastructure of Oikonomia is built of trust bridges that criss-cross the waterway.  The trust bridges connect household economies in a grid of centers.  If the grid was not invisible it would look similar to the ceiling detail of the Palasio de Comares, Alhambra, Granada5, only in three dimension.  The grid of centers are based on the theory of centers by Christopher Alexander, in the Nature of Order series, book one, The Phenomenon of Life.  The centers come into reality one household at a time.  Imagine each household is a dot on the grid.  At first there are no dots and no grid.  As the first household joins the Digital City of Oikonomia the first dot is placed and a field of centers is created.  Alexander begins to explain this concept on page 305 of his book the Nature of Order, Book One, The Phenomenon of Life, as he starts the second half of his book on the Personal Nature of Order, Section 3/ Wholeness and Feeling.  Alexander calls the dot a center but he also uses the term center to define the relationship of the dot to the space around it and the personal feeling created by the dot.  The first dot becomes alive because of its relationship to the whole.  When the second dot is placed on the grid the field of centers change as the relationship to the space changes. As more and more dots are placed on the grid the field of centers becomes more complex.  Remember the dots are household economies and as the households join the Digital City of Oikonomia they come to life in their relationship to the whole and define the city. \r\nEach household economy has its own digital financial pattern which is a center in itself.  The household economies are connected through digital trust bridges in the field of centers.  The households are the power source, so to speak, for the grid of centers.  The household centers effect and determine the type of social, natural, & economic capital that exists by their interaction through the grid.  The household financial patterns are based on the reconnection of individual human values with social, natural, & economic capital.  At the household level, people determine what is important to them.  They include their emotional, physical, and spritual needs in their personal household pattern.  Through the grid households communicate their needs, act on them, and have an effect on the outcome of the world they live in through their interactions.\r\nThe Digital City of Oikonomia is made up of six main patterns;  the conservation economy pattern, the digital trust bridge pattern, the digital citizen pattern, the creative democratic database pattern, and the digital social task system pattern.  Each of these patterns exist in relationship to the whole city.', '1. THE CONSERVATION ECONOMY PATTERN\r\nSets the Digital City of Oikonomia in context to a pattern for a sustainable society.  This creates a structure upon which to develop trust bridges that further develop the Oikonomian society.  The field of household centers adhere to the Conservation Economy Pattern developed by Eco-Trust for a sustainable society.  It you go to http://www.conservationeconomy.net you can view an interactive version of the pattern map pictured in Figure 3.  The digital infrastructure of Oikonomia will enhance Eco-Trusts', 'THE DIGITAL TRUST BRIDGE PATTERN  \r\nA digital structure for the trust relationships between households/centers. The digital infrastructure of Oikonomia will enhance Eco-Trusts Conservation Economy pattern by putting in place the noticeably missing links between household economies and social, natural, & economic capital through digital trust relationships.\r\nProblem Statement:\r\nMany people or households do not have relationships with others that make full use of trust as an asset.  Some people live a long way away from others they can have trust relationships with.  Establishing trust bridges is hard.  In a region of close proximity there may be many more trust relationships a person can have if they know they are available.  \r\nContext:\r\nTrust relationships between people are very important to daily life. They ease problems in peoples lives and foster mutual assistance.  These trust relationships are what we call trust bridges.  A trust bridge helps people work together and increases social capital.  Most people are trustworthy in one situation or another.  Trust is a vital asset that should be used to its fullest potential.  \r\nReal Life Example:\r\nI give the real life example of Alfie & Ruth Tatum to show how trust bridges work in everyday life. Alfie and Ruth Tatum are middle-aged people with six children.  They belong to an inter-city Evangelical Church they helped found over 15 years ago.  Alfie works in the city as a sales man for the local city seaport.  Ruth doesnt work outside the home.  She takes care of and home schools the children.  The Tatums live about 30 miles from the inner-city where Alfie works.  Everyday Ruth drives Alfie five miles to the commuter train, which takes him into the inner-city.  Ruth keeps the family van to use during the day.  \r\nAlfie earns enough to support the family in a modest way.  The Tatums home is in a semi-rural area.  They own approximately three quarters of an acre with a large three story five-bedroom house on it.  Sales at the port have been down in the last two years.  Alfies income has been less than normal for an extended period.  Sometimes the Tatums are not able to make their house payment.  The pastor of their church helps them pay bills when the Tatums cannot.\r\nThe Tatums lifestyle is based on human values that are important to them.  They have certain religious beliefs that are manifested in the church they belong to.  They believe in home schooling their children even though public education is available and there is a school within one block of their home.  Caring for the children is very draining on Ruth.  She is clinically depressed but able to maintain her daily responsibilities as a mother and a teacher.  Both Alfie and Ruth are intelligent, socially minded people.  The Tatum children are socialized with one another and play together on the property.  The children participate in some activities with other home schooled children.\r\nThe Tatums find people in their neighborhood are not as friendly as they would like.  However, the Tatums are not involved in the school, community grange, or sports activities that bring others in the community together.  Instead the Tatums are involved in their church which is over 30 miles away.  Sometimes Ruth and the children feel isolated in their home environment.  They had lived in the inter-city within the close proximity of other people.  There was more social interaction in their daily lives.  On the other hand, Alfie, who still works in the city, is happy to be home with his family on the weekends and away from other people.  He is glad to come back to a semi-rural community.\r\nOne neighbor, named Gilly, has become a good friend of Ruth.  Sometimes they walk together for exercise.  Ruth and Gilly have a lot in common and enjoy talking together.  Their friendship has blossomed because they seem to have mutual human values.  Gilly has a son named Prince who enjoys playing with the Tatum children.  Ruth and Gilly have a mutually supportive relationship.  One time Ruths freezer went out and she was unable to afford one for a few weeks.  Gilly stored Ruths meat in her freezer until Ruth was able to purchase a new freezer.  Another time, Gillys boss wouldnt let her off work in time to pick up her son from school.  Ruth had her boys walk to the school to pickup Prince and kept him for the afternoon until Gilly could get home from work.  Recently, Gilly and Prince were on their way home near dusk.  They saw Alfie and the four boys walking by the road up a long hill about two miles from home.  Gilly stopped the car to talk to them.  Alfie had taken the boys to a park to collect salamanders.  They had locked the keys in the van.  Ruth couldnt come pick them up because their other vehicle was broken down.  Their only choice was to walk home, which was especially difficult for the smallest boy.  Gilly gave them a ride home to get the car keys.  Without the good fortune of Gilly passing by to help, they would have not made it home before dark let alone back to the van before the park closed and the gate was locked.\r\nThe Tatums do not have a strong financial position.  However, there are other aspects of their life that are important and valuable to them.  It is important to the Tatums to home school the children.  To care for the children in this way Ruth does not work outside the home.  This reduces the annual income of the Tatum family considerably.  They would not trade this aspect for money.  Other relationships, like with the pastor of their church, make up the difference when the Tatums are short of money.  The commuter train and their friend Gilly are examples of how alternate resources can make up for the fact the Tatums only afford to keep one vehicle operational at a time.  These alternative resources have value as part of the Tatums household economy.\r\nForces:  Fear is a barrier to relationships and peoples willingness to build bridges.  Fear inhibits positive social traits, and instead results in greed or other negative social influences  Dropping the fear quotient is an important component in developing social capital and building trust bridges.  Information, knowledge, openness, diversity, inclusivity, and a middle ground help people to open up, become unguarded and feel safe.  This helps the way people use their social resources like networks, norms, and trust (collectively known as social capital) to better their conditions. Trust and networks are defined not only as outcomes of social capital but as factors that help build social capital between individuals, supporting a non linear definition of the concept.\r\nSoluton Statement:\r\nTherefore, we should connect people with compatible values by establishing digital trust bridges through computer-mediated communication.  Digital trust bridges can help people find trust relationships with one another.   Each household creates their own digital economic pattern in a digital system set up to accept household patterns.  The household economic patterns in the digital system communicate their values with one another.  One household pattern, talks to another household pattern, talks to another household pattern, sometimes one to one and sometimes one to many.  The households both find and offer alternate resources for and to one another.  This opens up more opportunities for the households to afford the values that are important to their own lives and the lives of other people.  In this type of trust relationship the players develop a new greater good pattern that benefits a group of people as a whole.  You probably have experiences similar to those of Alfie and Ruth in your own life.  Your own digital trust bridges can make life more worthwhile by the social capital that is created in these relationships.\r\nDigital Example:\r\nIf households are digitally connected through trust bridges they can have trust relationships of new and creative kinds.  In a digital system, Alfie and Ruth can create a digital economic pattern of their household including their human values as part of their financial plan.  If many households, like the Tatums, have a digital economic pattern, these patterns can talk to one another or do business.  The same way Ruth and Gilly do business but through a digital trust bridge.  As the Tatum household tells their human values through their economic pattern, potential trust relationships will come into view.  Some relationships will be with close neighbors and some will be with people far away.  Maybe a digitally connected home school family from the East Coast would mail used books to a digitally connected home school family on the West Coast via a trust bridge.  Maybe a digitally connected pastor from one parish would have a reciprocal relationship to send money through a digital trust bridge to the pastor of another parish to help his people through a financially difficult time.      \r\nAnother option for Ruth is to create more trust relationships with people in her own neighborhood whom she hasnt met but have similar values. Someone who Ruth is connected with through a digital trust bridge might offer freezer space to a family of eight, if Gilly didnt live across the street.  If Ruth was part of a digital structure that helped her communicate her needs and values these relationships could get started.  In reciprocity, Ruth could also offer her services to others who have a need.  These trust relationships built in a digital environment can help Ruth build trust relationships in her neighborhood that are currently lacking.  This would relieve the sense of isolation Ruth is currently feeling. The household patterns grow and interrelate with one another in an organic way in a digitally collocated setting.\r\nKnown Uses:\r\nAt Evergreen College in Olympia, Washington, USA, I participated in a year long class called Community Information Systems.  In small groups of students we worked with organizations and groups of people around the world interested in building information systems that created trust relationships.  One group worked with a small town in Orient, Iowa, USA.  The town had a database of its citizens and surrounding population.  They wanted to find a way to use the database to communicate weather conditions to people in their community through the internet.  Sometimes roads were closed or school schedules were changed due to snow.  This caused safety hazards and worries about children.  Especially if you worked in a town fifteen miles away and you werent sure when your child got out of school and if they were in a safe place.  The radio station was in the next largest city and didnt report information about roads and schools in their little community.  Through weather postings on their website and broadcast e-mail using the database they hoped to notify community members of weather related safety information.  In theory, community members could add, change, update and access personal contact information in the database.  This would allow friends and neighbors the information they needed to contact one another and help others out in an emergency.\r\nOther students helped a community in Africa report health problems and collect health data in local villages.  Sometimes villagers were afraid for others to know their health problems because of social taboos. This type of reporting increases awareness and lessens local fears about health problems.\r\nAnother group helped in a writing project.  They created a forum for authors to share creative ideas in a safe environment.  A common fear for a writer is the exposure of their ideas to others.      \r\nTHE DIGITALFINANCIAL PATTERN \r\nThe first patterns that identify the household economy on the Oikonomian landscape.\r\nThe first stage of development for Oikonomia is to create a digital financial pattern for households to enter their personal financial information into.  In the beginning these patterns will look much like a conventional financial plan.  However a human values piece will be developed and integrated into the conventional financial pattern.  Over time the human values piece will be improved with use and the evolution of this concept.  As this happens, hopefully, the conventional financial plan will be diminished or become so integrated with the human values piece that it is one and the same.\r\nProblem: In a Chrematistic economy individuals can build a financial plan that shows their net worth in an exchange value, money system.  Based on this traditional plan the individual can take action to increase his or her net worth.  A traditional financial plan does not include many other aspects of every day living that are valuable to an individual, household, or society as a whole.\r\nContext: \r\nFor an Oikonomian economy, I propose individuals build household economy patterns that include information from their traditional financial plan, but are not limited to this type of economic information.  Other aspects of daily living are of value and can be included in the household pattern.  Examples of these important aspects are listed on the Genuine Progress Index developed by John Cobb and include such things as the value of volunteerism, parenting and eldercare, or subsistence living; the cost of crime, gambling, or substance abuse; and the value of forests and wetlands.  This is just to name a few, as households create economic patterns the list will grow exponentially.  These listed aspects of daily living are based on what is important, useful, and valuable to the individual household.\r\nOnce these household financial patterns are in place the patterns can begin talking to one another and do business together.  This business will include the human values the digital household patterns are based on.  In the chrematistic economy these human values would be excluded from the financial plan.  These household financial patterns are centers inside a larger pattern of trust bridges that benefit society as a whole.  The benefit to the whole society is a center made up of these smaller household economy patterns.  \r\nReal Life Example:\r\nThe Tatums assets include a home and land valued at $350,000.  Their equity in the home is $75,000.  The bank loan on the real estate is $275,000 which they just refinanced at 5.5%   They have used up all of their savings.  They are buying a large van valued at $18,000 on credit at 1.5% interest.  They use available credit cards to purchase clothing, necessities, and emergency repairs.  Their credit card debt exceeds $8,000 at 9.5% interest.  This debt includes payment they made for a new drain field.\r\nAlfies gross income is $48,000.  Ruth does not work outside the home. Alfie receives medical and dental benefits for his family through his employers group plan.  At age 58 Alfies 401k retirement plan is worth $200,000.  He has a Universal Life Insurance policy with a $500,000 death benefit and a cash value of $8,000.\r\nThe Tatums have six children ranging from age four to age nineteen.  There are no funds available for the childrens college education.  They can borrow against the cash value of Alfies 401k and life insurance policy.   The children are home schooled and will need to take a proficiency test to receive a high school diploma.  Both parents are college educated.\r\nThe average monthly expenses for the household total $3,700 including taxes.  This leaves approximately $300.00 per month or $3,600 per year for any extras like household appliances, furnishings, or emergency funds.  \r\nThe Tatums financial information can be entered into a financial planners software and net worth and cash flow financial statements prepared.  This will give the Tatums a good idea of their financial position and the actions they can take to improve their financial situation.   \r\nForces:\r\nUp to now a main purpose for peoples financial information has been to help them do business with businesses, organizations, government agencies, and schools.  People are client or consumers of these organizing structures products.  To inter-relate with the structure the person must provide or give up certain personal information.  This serves the purpose of the organization in selling their product to the person.  This upward flow of personal financial information was invented by and for the use of bureaucratic organizations.\r\nOn the other hand, untraditional economic information includes the benefits of and costs to social and natural capital.  This information has not been measured in our Chrematistic economy as a standard rule.  We dont have a lot of experience in measuring this type of capital.  It is also possible different units of measure will be needed to calculate the value of both tangible and intangible social and natural capital.  Providing opportunities for humans to begin working on this social and natural capital valuation problem on an individual basis will create new social innovations.\r\nSolution:\r\nTherefore, we should create a digital input system where households can input their economic patterns including both financial information and other forms of social and natural capital information important to the individual or household.  These patterns should start by including financial information that would exist in a traditional financial plan.  This information would include personal information, income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and forms of insurance attributable to the household as a whole.  Then there should be a place in the digital economic pattern for untraditional economic information.  This untraditional information should include benefits and costs of important aspects of social and natural capital that are of value to the household on a personal level.  Development of untraditional economic information will be a science The Digital City of Oikonomia can take up in a leadership role toward world social development.\r\nDigital Example:\r\nThe Tatums traditional financial information is listed in the Real Life Example above.  This same financial information would also be listed in the households digital financial pattern.  However, this information does not reflect many true costs and benefits of social and natural capital that affects their livelihood.  Additional information important to the Tatums human values would be added to the traditional financial information.   With the development of a values based digital financial pattern for households, the Tatums could record, evaluate, and make decisions based on more specific and personal information\r\nAlfie travels by commuter train to work each day.  This saves in the cost of wear and tear on the one family vehicle and extends the life of their van.  The cost of commuting is cheaper than the cost of gas to travel to and from work.  The cost of insurance on the van would be higher also if he was using it to commute 30 miles to work each day.  By taking the train Alfie is able to leave his van for the family to use during the day.  Ruth can take the children to doctor appointments and swimming lessons.  In addition, Alfie is helping the environment by not polluting the atmosphere with fuel emissions on his commute.  Some of these costs and benefits of commuting can be added up in a monetary way.  Some of the costs and benefits are not equitable in terms of money but have social and natural value.  These costs and benefits can at least be listed through words that describe their value to the Tatum family.  Maybe a number value could also be attributed to the costs and benefits to help the Tatums evaluate their importance to the family as a whole.\r\nThe Tatums can collect and then control this type of information in their digital financial pattern.  The purpose of the information is to benefit the household in allowing them to find economic alternatives that grant them their human values instead of depleting them.  As the Tatums digital household pattern talks to other household patterns through a trust bridge they may find other commuters in their same situation.  All of these commuters are interested in lowering fuel emissions in their community.  However, one of the other households has no vehicle at all.  As an act of Social Capital, Alfie can pickup the other commuter, named Steven, and help him get to the train.  In reciprocity, the other commuter may be the one who stores the Tatums meat in their freezer when the freezer goes out until the Tatums can afford a new one.  It was their digital household patterns that brought Alfie and Steven together.\r\nIf the Tatums only objective was to get Alfie to work on time so the boss doesnt get mad and he can hold down his job, a lot of social capital would have been lost along the way.  Alfie might jump in the van and speed off to work everyday thinking his first and only objective is to earn a living without thinking of alternatives.  He would probably run up a large gas credit card to be paid off at 18% interest.  By considering his other human values, Alfie can accomplish his need to get to work in a timely manner through alternative resources, help others, and in turn create social capital that ends up to be directly beneficial to his family.  His digital financial pattern gives him a new kind of vehicle in which to work with other considerations.  \r\nKnown Uses:\r\nAt this time many people are learning to manage their own financial position using software built for the personal computer.  Some well-known personal financial software programs are Microsoft Money and Quicken.  For preparing personal income tax there are software programs like Turbo Tax and Tax Cut by HR Block.  Personal account transaction information from some banks and investment houses can be downloaded and integrated with these financial software programs.\r\nAll of these programs help the individual or household get their arms around their personal financial information.  However, these well-known programs are not open source software.  These programs also do not allow the individual to add other information that is important and can have a large effect on the financial life of the household.\r\nMost important of all, current financial software programs for individuals do not allow households to interact with one another.  Some user groups like E-Bay come the closest in allowing individuals to do business with one another.   \r\nTHE DIGITAL CITIZENS PATTERN  \r\nDigital Citizens are the real people that make up the real households that digitally inhabit the City of Oikonomia.\r\nProblem Statement:\r\nWhether citizens interact in a real world or a virtual world they are still human beings.  As people, digital citizens have the same human characteristics and the same human needs they have always had in the real world.  From a digital perspective nothing changes about the human being except the ability to interact with more human beings in new and innovative ways.  Sometimes this means the ability to interact with more strangers.  The positive aspect for the  Digital Citizen is the possibility for new opportunities to solve unmet human needs and enhance current interpersonal relationships through computer generated media.\r\nContext:\r\nDigital citizenship and identity will be one of the subjects of discussion among the first citizens of Oikonomia.  No real person will be denied entry to the city, but proving that you are who you say you are will be a responsibility of citizenship.  Fingerprints will be proof there are not two of the same person in the City but they will not be used for identification.  A system of anonymous identity numbers will be issued to those who prove their identity but the city will not track identities or identity numbers. The digital citizen can work, interact, do business and keep anonymous records in the Creative Democratic Database once issued an identity number.  Identity numbers can be changed as often as desired within the system because the actual number is not important for citizenship, you just have to have one to interact.  \r\nDuplicate, false, and even suspicious identities will be locked out of the city until re-verification is made by the citizen.  Reporting of duplicate, false or suspicious identities will be a responsibility of every citizen, every day, in every way.  Reporting will be made easy as will the re-verification of identity for the legitimate citizen.  Leniency will be given to false reporting because little harm is done to the digital citizen.\r\nTrust bridges will determine layers of interaction between citizens.  The trust bridges may exclude or include citizens based on criteria.  However, there is no criteria for being a citizen except authentic verification as a real person.\r\nReal Life Example:\r\nYou only need to be born to live in this world.  Who you are is unimportant to your right to be born.  Once you are born you have an identity.  Your identity stays the same throughout your life.  You can change your names as often as you want but you are still the same person.  However, citizenship is limited to your country of origin or choice.  You cannot be a citizen of multiple countries. Except in the case of dual-citizenship which is limited to two countries.  Citizenship in the real world is limited by place which also limits opportunities for people to be connected around the world.\r\nForces:\r\nPeople around the world have similar basic needs.  One of these needs is identity which includes values, spirit, and personal integrity.  As digital citizens people can look for ways to protect their identity from becoming diminished.  Entering into reciprocity relationships through digital media will help humans build security, self-esteem, and hope for themselves \r\nSolution:\r\nAll people can become citizens of The Digital City of Oikonomia.  Digital citizenship is similar to birth in the real world but without borders.  There are no barriers to entry because the only criteria is that you be a real person.  No matter what race, religion, creed, or ethnic origin you can enter the city, exist and interact.  This allows people from all around the world to become connected.  The unrestricted connections of digital citizenship can help people find new ways to help one another.  Through digital interaction people from around the world can work together to fill human needs. \r\nDigital Example:\r\nMany people are from indigenous cultures that do not participate in the market economy.  These people are often not as connected to the rest of the world.  Sometimes this is for the best.  However, if and when natural resources are diminished the world will probably come to them eventually.  At this point and time it appears the market economy will be the first one knocking on the door (so to speak) of indigenous people.  The American Indian is a testimony to the ill fate of indigenous cultures.  By becoming digital citizens indigenous people might find solutions to preserve their culture and heritage in a proactive way.  This will also help preserve diversity in our world.\r\nKnown Uses:\r\nSalmon Nation is described as anywhere that Pacific salmon have ever run which includes an area on the west coast rain forest of North America from Alaska to California.  Salmon Nation is a community of caretakers and citizens, a community that stretches across arbitrary boundaries and bridges urban-rural divides. We bring new meaning to the word cooperative -- with unusual alliances of tribes, fishermen, farmers, loggers, and urban-dwellers working together to improve our neighborhoods and watersheds.7\r\n  Anyone can become a citizen of Salmon Nation by logging on to http://www.salmonnation.com.  To become a citizen you must say the Salmon Nation oath:\r\nI believe that where I live matters. \r\nI believe that there is enough for everyone. \r\nI recognize that we all live downstream of one another and are thus interconnected.   \r\nI believe our experience makes the difference and that it is important to know the stories of this place. \r\nI am right where I belong.\r\nI am a Citizen of Salmon Nation and \r\nI pledge to live here like I mean it!7\r\nThe goal (of Salmon Nation) is to create a citizenry that votes and makes behavioral choices that contribute to enhancing the health of whole watersheds and the economies of the people that live in them.7  \r\nTHE CREATIVE DEMOCRATIC DATABASE PATTERN\r\nDiscusses principles of trust and interaction in the digital city and define how private data is controlled.\r\nProblem Statement:  \r\nWith some type of technology to connect household economies, people will have more opportunities to build trust relationships that create good interactions and empower society to solve important problems.  Hopefully, over time, a technology will evolve that can accomplish this task in a big way.  This technology must invoke representation of individual feelings and values.  In a very rudimentary way this technology can be started by establishing The Creative Democratic Database to connect household economies with one another.  I would imagine this database to be the beginning of a much greater technological system that develops through innovations resulting from use of the database.  \r\nContext:\r\nIndividual households will begin to use the Creative Democratic Database to store their personal information in an anonymous way.  In the Creative Democratic Database personal and financial information will be owned and kept private by the individual, not given to corporation or government agencies in order to do business. This information has long been used by businesses or governments as power.  It has helped keep economic capital in the hands of a few.  However, the personal and financial information of households and individuals belongs to the people.  The power of this information should remain in the hands of people.  \r\nCollectively, the power of this personal information is like water behind a dam.  This power can be used for the betterment of human kind if people as a society can harness it.  In the Creative Democratic Database there will be a reverse flow of information from what is normal operating procedure today.  Personal information that once flowed up hill to businesses and government to perform transactions will now flow downhill to individuals based on their interactions.  \r\nAt this time, it may be a very long leap of faith to believe it is possible to change this flow of information.  Personally, I believe it is entirely probable with creative ingenuity. However, the most important idea here is not how we can accomplish the change in flow of personal information.  How to accomplish a task takes the focus off what is real.  We must concentrate on what is real, the final cause.   The concrete idea is to protect the security of peoples personal and financial information and control this information in a format that empowers the person, household, or society as a whole by changing the direction or flow of the information altogether.  Once we have this idea firmly planted we can go on to the work of accomplishing the idea.  \r\nReal Life Example: \r\nWe give out a large amount of personal information every time we enter into a business transaction.  To buy a house we tell the mortgage company our personal financial history.  We report where we live and who lives with us, where we work, what we do at work, how much we earn, how long we have worked in the same place, and other places we have worked.  We tell the mortgage company about the value of our personal assets, who we owe money to, and how well we pay our debts.  We give out personal and government identification numbers, account numbers, and bank account information.  We provide all of this information to a total stranger so they can decide if we are worthy to perform a business transaction with them.\r\nFrom the perspective of the business owner this information makes sure the individual he is doing business with is trustworthy.  The business owner wants to decide this for himself on every transaction so he requires the individual to provide a truck load of personal information.  However, the main thing the business owner needs to know is that the person is trustworthy.    \r\nForces:\r\nGiving up personal information to strangers leaves individuals vulnerable to those who would do harm to the individual by using this information for unintended uses.  As our world becomes more connected through information technology we do business with more strangers.  There needs to be a way for individuals to do business that does not require you to give up personal information to complete a transaction. \r\nSolution:\r\nWith their anonymous information collected in the Creative Democratic Database the individual can begin to do business together with other households, businesses, and government agencies.  A social system of human values can be built that makes it possible for people to interact with businesses without giving up their personal information. Instead of giving up personal information, each household can interact based on trust standards developed for various levels of interaction.  The most basic of these trust standards will be that only one of each real person exists within the digital city.  There are no false identities.  \r\nAs trust transactions take place the individual will take control of the information generated by these transactions.  In addition to controlling their own information the household can begin interjecting their personal values into these same transactions.  People will be more likely to interact with others that share their values.\r\nBy gravitating to transactions that also represent their own human feeling and values, people will begin to concentrate on what is important to them.  As they do this they will become more aware of ways to interact with other people and household that accomplish mutual tasks.  These mutual personal tasks will lead to awareness of mutual social tasks.   \r\nDigital Example:\r\nOne way to change the flow of personal information is in the trust bridges.  A Good Housekeeping Seal type of approval for anonymous identities that interact to certain standards can be set up and maintained.  This seal would create the same type of value that has been associated with the trust of a handshake.  To do business with an individual the commercial business would be required to set up an account without the usual demand for personal information.  Instead, the business would be required to push account transaction information into the individuals data collection site for management by the person.  All this would happen digitally without a lot of work by the citizen.\r\nKnown Uses:\r\nAt this time many businesses and government agencies allow account holders to access their record keeping system of personal and financial information about the account holder.  These systems allow the client to see recent transactions, find out account balances, or change personal information.  This assists the client in managing their account with the business or government agency.  However, this use of personal information does not give control of the account information back to the account holder.  It also does not keep the personal information of the client private from the business.  Because these information systems are privately owned by the business or government agency they do not address the need for households to do business with one another.  \r\nTHE DIGITAL SOCIAL SYSTEM PATTERN \r\nGood social health is real, not a dream.  Having good social health is similar to having good physical health.   A social system should serve the needs of society and make it healthy. Our current social health is starved by an economy that extracts human values from itself.  Poor social health is unreal.  Our task is to create a healthy society for all human beings.  \r\nProblem Statement: \r\nCreating a healthy social system can seem like a larger than life task. It can only be accomplished by seeing beyond our current reality and into the realm of the possible.  Figure 1. The Waterway of Human Kindness is only a figurative place but it can become a real place if we allow it into our hearts and minds.  In this same way we can create a socially healthy world by collectively envisioning in our hearts and minds how to go about doing this.  \r\nContext:\r\nOur world picture of the social change we need to accomplish is vague.  It is hard for the average person to understand the personal actions they might take to help improve our world as a whole.  \r\nBy building a technological system, that measures our human values and allows us to act on them, we can get a more accurate picture of the current social state of our world.  This will help us design methods to create a more liveable world for everyone.  On a personal level we will be able to see more clearly what our individual role is in defining and creating a world we like.\r\nStarting with our own household financial plans we can express how we relate with the world.  Then we can add in our human values and start to create change in our personal lives.  Through our own eyes we can see where and with whom we want to do business.  We can become collectively involved with others who share our human values.  Instead of being numb to the future of our world we can begin to take action that will make a difference.  \r\nSocial engagement is the energizing force for creating a healthy society in the Digital City of Oikonomia. The most important factors for social engagement are net working, common understanding, action, and levels of scale.  A social safety net is created through networks of exchange and support.  Networks are also an important means for transporting information, goods, and services across society.3\r\nCommon understanding creates awareness and cultural consciousness and a greater depth of explanation.  Information and self-awareness allow people to take the next step to determine our social values and how they will be assessed. With empathy for others we can develop the big picture view that we share in common as a global society.  \r\nAction is the way we adapt to changing forces in the world from within and outside society.  We shift from resistance to pro-action and look for positive alternatives. We make changes through collaboration, catalysts, & transitions.  Collaboration is also a catalyst in itself.  Through collaboration we build credibility which enhances the chances for action. We make transitions through gaps and leverage points that take us to the next level. Action varies from easy to difficult, supported to unsupported, from empowering to exclusive so we must gage our actions.\r\nWith norms and standards we create levels of scale from local to global.  Both qualitative and quantitative assessment indicators measure the flow of value at each levels of scale.  The flow of value must be an open loop that shows a trend over time and is not static.\r\nQualitative indicators of a healthy social system can be self-esteem, decision making ability, participation, personal experiences, vibes, self image, confidence, individual capacity, trust, and network richness and density.3  Quantative indicators measure that some sort of social resources are being utilized.3  Examples of these social measures can be meetings attended, people reached, volunteer hours, extent of involvement, neighbors known, people on your street known by name, continuity of programs, turnover, retention, contacts made, and attendees at an event.3\r\nThrough our technological system we can make the picture of what a healthy society looks like less vague.  We can create detail that addresses human needs like identity, personal integrity, spirit, values, security, self-esteem, and hope.3  Our communities can become places for openness, inclusivity, and diversity.3  Civic development will increase social capacity and include children and the aged.  Through information and referral communication we can offer access to knowledge for all.  A healthy society will have a chance to develop and grow.\r\nForces:  For a social system to be useful it must be understandable and it must explain what people experience in their daily lives.  The social system we create in our world must include all people.  This paper is from the eyes of the western world but an equal amount of examples relating to indigenous cultures and third world people must be added and included in our social system.  These  third world examples may be even less quantifiable in terms of a money system and will make our social system more robust.\r\nSolution:\r\nA new digital social system based on human values and powered by the people will evolve from The Digital City of Oikonomia and use of The Creative Democratic Database.  Through social engagement our world will become a more healthy place for humans to live.  The Digital City of Oikonomia is a legitimate idea that attempts to involve people who care about our world and want to see human values added to our lives, not extracted from it more and more each year.  The social reality of Oikonomia is not in conflict with our current system of government and business.  Its just that a new social system will come into place as the dots on the grid appear.  Perhaps our old system will just fizzle and become less useful.  A new system based on Oikonomia will be more useful to the people of the world to solve problems and work collectively.  Households around the world will become connected with one another in an economic way that promotes appropriate social development.  How can this happen? Through people like you and like me; times two, times four, times eight, times thousands.\r\nDigital Example:\r\nThe Seattle Community Network is ten years old now and has survived as a viable network of the many communities that make up the city of Seattle.  You can visit the network at http://www.scn.org.  SCN has a commitment to access, commitment to service, commitment to democracy, commitment to the world community, and a commitment to the future.8  The network identifies its area of work into communities of activism, arts, civic education, environment, health, housing, jobs, media, neighborhoods, people, politics, recreation, sci-tech, social services, spiritual, transportation, and volunteers.8  The slogan of the Seattle Community Network is free democratic technology for all.   \r\nHistory\r\nThe Digital City of Oikonomia is the outcome of several years of study at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, USA under the direction of Doug Schuler.  My year-long involvement with Doug in his Community Information Systems course, another experience in his Digital Cities course, and a year of independent study have given plenty of food for thought and creativity.  My original goal in going to Evergreen was to learn how to create an on-line financial community and that goal had developed into a more complex idea for the common good of society.', 'The Digital City of Oikonomia is a legitimate idea that attempts to involve people who care about our world and want to see human values added to our lives, not extracted from it more and more each year.  How can it happen? Through people like you and like me; times two, times four, times eight, times thousands.  Purposefully, we should not look into the future of The Digital City of Oikonomia too far.  Preferably the talents of new citizens should mark the digital path of the city.  Perhaps, people like you will volunteer their technical abilities to pound the first stakes in the digital ground. The first digital citizens and volunteers will work together to develop the database and smooth the road for those who come after them.  The making of personal digital financial patterns and human value strategies will be the source of early interaction between digital citizens.  Each financial pattern is private and there doesnt need to be any consensus but there will be lots of discussion to bring out issues.\r\nIt will be better if the Oikonomian society develops slowly and does not become a snowball out of control.  It will also be better if we can stay half way in the realm of the unrealistic and half way in a realistic world so we dont loose sight of those things possible and the twinkle on the Waterway of Human Kindness.\r\nGaining an understanding of the work of EcoTrust will be another early task for Oikonomia as a city.  Digital citizens will need to learn the core forms of capital in the conservation economy and how they work together.\r\nChristopher Alexanders theory of centers and the relationships of centers will weave together the individual financial patterns and the core forms of capital.  Digital focus groups will be needed to develop Alexanders principles and manage the grid of social patterns that transpire.\r\nIn the Digital City of Oikonomia it will be important that social interaction happens.  That Alexander, EcoTrust, and Oikonomian principles are studied and played out until better ideas come along.  Beyond that, the Digital City of Oikonomia should be a place for peace.  There is no need to work for a better tomorrow without peace.\r\nThe Digital City of Oikonomia is a digital place for digital citizens to come together as community to have an effect on the character of their own future.  Please help me make the Digital City of Oikonomia a reality.

(611, 591, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'Successful patterns in social contexts are emergent properties of social activities. We observe a number of events and suspect that a \"pattern is emerging\" or as Leo Tolstoy wrote in Anna Karenina, \"All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\"\r\n\r\nThe purpose of pattern language is to decode the \"patterns of success\" so they can be replicated. The problem is that those who create the successes are often not good at unpacking them into a structure that others can learn from.', 'Many of the patterns on thise site contain excellent ideas and many fine statements of intent or piurpose and prescriptions for solving the problems indicated, but very few of them contain useful pattern langauges that others can draw onm. \r\n\r\nThis pattern is started with the aim of showing how such submissions can be converted into pattern language.', 'Pattern elucidation is an analytical process that attempts to reach a general conclusion by exhaustive particularisation in the process of which, personality and narration are replaced by roles, relationships, context and process. Not every community has a Dorothy Okello, but many communities have a women\'s health activist who needs better communication with her counterparts in other villages, regional centres and the WHO. \r\n\r\nNot every community includes the nephew of the regional governor, but many will have a person with more vertical connections in the social and political hierarchy and knowing how to engage that person to support a project is valuable knowledge.\r\n\r\nBy teasing out the roles, relationship, context and process in multiple successful programmes, we hope to enable the pattern to reveal itself. Achieving the first part of that pair is the purpose of this pattern.\r\n\r\nI have started with Pam McLean\'s <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=52\">Human networks bridging the digital divide in rural Nigeria</a> because it deals directly with a project that has some history and is unfiolding in a very difficult environment where unsuccessful choices will quickly become evident. That it continues at all means that it must be doing something right, the question is, what?\r\n\r\nThe first step is to read Pam\'s document which has a number of characteristics that will, unfortunately, need to disappear. These are the narrative and anecdotal tools that give life to storytelling, the connectives that enable us to graps and recall the gist of the story even after we have forgotten the details themselves. However, in the immediate future, the whole document needs to remain available because at this stage we cannot know for sure where, and why, the pattern language will need to branch, drilling deeper into some aspect that previously seemed self explanatory.\r\n\r\nThe vital points to remember from Pam\'s pattern is that, \r\n1. although the <em>project objective</em> is to bring communication tools to rural Nigerian villages, \r\n2. the <b> problem</b> that she is solving is how to reach that goal by <b>using Human networks</b>\r\n\r\nWhile the outcome in this particular case may be to establish ICT network access, the way it is being dealt with when tthe access doesn\'t yet exist, might also be applied to introducing environmental awareness in such a community, or attempting to eradicate feamle genital mutilation.\r\n\r\nThis is the point of pattern language, that we can derive from one context, successful strategies for another context altogether.', 'This is a start on describing the solution to the problem of extracting from narrative knowledge the implicit understanding behind it. The html structure is not good, with far too much screen space included (to be fixed). The original material is coded in red followed by the enquiry into its statements. The indents indicate that some queries may be subsets of a higher level one.

(612, 592, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'Lack of representation in media production results in reduced diversity of ideas and perspectives in the media. This often results in manipulation, lack of political participation and knowledge about rights. It lessens opportunities to engage in politics or  to assume responsibilities in government. Indigenous people who are denied their voice will find it difficult to fight oppression, work with allies, or maintain their culture. Without the means to make their voices heard, communities become atomized within themselves and invisible to the outside world.', 'Indigenous people in rural and urban areas in developing and developed countries around the world need to create ', 'This pattern could be applied in urban areas and in rural areas where communities have suffered years of economic and social stagnation. Indigenous media is different from media that is produced by and for other underserved groups such as ethnic and sexual minorities, women, and youth.  For one thing, indigenous people often dont know how to engage the media from their village far from electricity, telephones, press, or radio or television stations.  For another thing, the knowledge that is intrinsic to their culture may be localized.  It may be centuries old, embodied in stories or other non-written forms and endangered.   \r\n \r\nInformation is essential for development and it is now urgent to empower indigenous people with media technologies and knowledge. There are many activities which indigenous farmers could undertake to help improve their lives with better access to media. If, for example, the farmers of Chiapas in Southeast Mexico could sell their products directly to the companies they could improve their economic situation.  Currently intermediaries buy coffee in poor villages for a few coins which is then sold to big companies at great profit. Access to the market depends on knowledge and the technological means to capitalize on it. \r\n\r\nWe know that this is not only a problem for the poor. Many people around the world have problems related to lack of media access. The fact that large corporations control the media becomes a matter of life and death because the media is the de facto gatekeeper of important information related to health and safety. Indigenous people often lack the power, knowledge and technology to produce their own information and their own media. The Internet could provide a new way to communicate. For example, in the south and south-east areas of México, there are new Internet access centers but these are only for people who already know how to use computers and the Internet, knowledge that many indigenous people dont have.\r\n\r\nIndigenous Media simultaneously addresses many needs of marginalized indigenous groups. Thus embracing this pattern entails education and training, policy, resources (time, money, people, for example) in addition to access to the technology itself. An e-mail campaign or a panel discussion on a radio show can help organize a campaign against a group of intermediaries or to denounce bad legislators. In Mexico\'s rural communities such as Chiapas, Guerrero  and Oaxaca radio stations managed by indigenous farmers and satellite gateways to the Internet can make the difference between intimidation and free speech. Some notable examples from around the world include <i>Radio Tambuli Radio Network</i> in the Philippines, the <i>Deadly Mob</i> aboriginal organization of Alice Springs, Australia, and the <i>Koahnic Broadcast Corporation</i> in Alaska.\r\n\r\nNon-indigenous people can play a role in support of this pattern. They can organize training programs in the 3,100 new access points are installed in the municipalities around Mexico and/or in Internet cafes. Many institutions and international agencies whose programs include technology in rural areas can donate equipment, access to the Internet (maybe via satellite gateways), and Internet streaming. NGOs with training and learning programs can work with indigenous farmers and others to learn how to apply media access technology. Mino of the Ashaninka native people in Peru who was instrumental in establishing Internet access for his people stresses that indigenous people must not allow non-indigenous people to monopolize information. For that reason, he and others in his group carefully observed every technical installation that was carried out in his village.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the pattern language and other educational tools are not available in native languages and are useless to most indigenous people. Many of these stakeholders have experience with ICT who can share their stories of success and failure, but they can\'t express their thoughts in English.\r\n\r\nRadio, print media, television, all have potential to help shape public opinion. When rural farmers acquire Internet skills and can access media, they can apply this knowledge to create their own information and communication systems.

Network messages will be rated for interest and approval, and those messages with high marks will be sent up the hierarchy so they will be more widely visible. Messages that reach the top will be globally visible and therefore doubly important, first for themselves, and second because everyone will be reading them. A bandwagon effect will reinforce these messages to the point where everyone will know that everyone knows that everyone has read them, thus creating a global consciousness. \r\n\r\nMessages that reach the global level will by definition be both highly approved and of great interest, so it will be difficult for partisan and hateful messages on the one hand, or dull and platitudinous messages on the other to succeed. Kind and witty words that finesse a difficulty or point the way to a win-win solution should do best. Over time, a voice of humanity will redefine the \"other\" in a positive way, and the human race will come to have a better view of itself. Stupidity, hatred and greed will be at a disadvantage in the new conditions, which will validate the global perspective required to solve the great problems of war, social injustice and environmental destruction. \r\n\r\nEvery individual or community will be able to send a message to any other community or individual in the voh network. A message from a community begins as a \"suggested\" message written by a member of the community. If the candidate message reaches consciousness in the sending community and achieves the pre-agreed threshold of ratings, InterMix will automatically forward the message to the addressed individual or community. When a community receives a message, a \"listener\" sub-hierarchy of the receiving community will process the message. Depending on the \"strength\" of the message and on the reaction in the listener groups, the message may rise in the listener hierarchy until it comes to community consciousness. (The \"strength\" of a message has to do with the size of the sending community and how high the message\'s ratings were in the sending community.) \r\n\r\nImportantly, a <a href=\"http://blog.voiceofhumanity.net/newslog2.php/__show_article/_a000252-000043.htm?time=1092523271\">structured mediation service</a> will be available to handle inter-group conflicts. Where there are two groups in conflict, there can be three voices to resolve the problem, that of each of the groups, and that of the two groups together as one. This bringing in of the common humanity of conflicting groups is an altogether new and promising approach to inter-group conflict that really really needs to be followed up on. \r\n\r\nThere is yet another extraordinary, even transcendent, result to be expected from the voh network: the development of collective personalities. Through the exchange of collective messages, every great community will develop its own recognizable sense of self. \r\n\r\nWe may imagine in today\'s world that a nation has its own character, but when a country has become truly articulate, when it can crack a joke or make a promise, then its personality will be much more discernable. The possibility of a fantastical new world civilization emerges, where not only humanity, but also Womankind, China, Islam, Academia, Business, Paris, and all the other collectivities have developed each their own immortal personas, forming a lively, buzzing new heaven, where the force of personality will be the currency. \r\n\r\nA new heaven and so a new earth. We mortals will be fascinated and much impressed. Mankind and Womankind will be King and Queen of the new realm, with nations and cities as peers, and the religions, parties and scholarly trends as advisors. Humanity will overarch all as arbiter and guide. \r\n\r\nThis could be a disturbing picture of the world giving in to an almost medieval authority structure, except that each of these new gods and goddesses will be under our control in a system that gives the grand prize to love and wit. Moreover, this new governance for the world will not be a replacement for the current national and international structures, but rather an addition, holding only moral sway, not directly in control of military and economic might. People, who are now alienated by colorless bureaucracy, will want to be involved, because the issues will have been personalized and so made accessible. Most people have little patience with the issues of government, great or small, but if China snubs Womankind, *that* will need to be discussed and understood, and maybe something will need to be done! Within this hive of activity, the real issues of importance could get lost, to be sure, but under the guidance of humanity, a coherent set of sensible policies for planet earth should be more feasible than under the current nation-state system, which is not coping very well with population and technological advances. \r\n\r\nIt does sound farfetched, this new heaven and new earth, so I was glad when I stumbled on the idea of the <a href=\"http://blog.voiceofhumanity.net/newslog2.php/_v252/__show_article/_a000252-000028.htm\">Annotated Web</a>. The AntWeb, as it might be called, will enable voh communities to share information about websites on a topical basis. The blogger community will be targeted because sharing information about websites is a big part of blogging, and getting the breakdown by topic right for bloggers has not yet been quite satisfactorily accomplished, so this is an opportunity to get the voh network off the ground without requiring a religious conversion on the part of the users.', 'Underlying a voice of humanity there must be a globally distributed database -- this article is about the overall operation and structure of that database. A separate article will deal with how we build the voice of humanity on top of the database.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilosophy \r\n\r\nKeep it easy. Python. Home-made simplified peer-to-peer and security logic. No java. No UML. \r\n\r\n\r\nBasics \r\n\r\nHubs, items, users, categories, ratings and linkages with rules are the basics. Hubs are single InterMix instances, normally one per PC, each carrying many categories of item and servicing one or more users. Items are xml documents with both category meta-data and built-in meta-data, plus either item contents or a pointer to item contents. Users apply ratings to items. Users, hubs and categories are tracked as items themselves in the database. Meta-data is indexed along with ratings so that items may be retrieved efficiently in rating order using meta-data criteria within a category. Hub owners and other trusted users manually create long-term linkages between categories on a single hub or between pairs of hubs, specifying what items and ratings should be transferred, and how often. For each linkage, items may be exchanged in both directions, while ratings are always transferred in one direction only thus creating a hierarchy where the linked category that receives the ratings is above the hub/category that sends the ratings for that particular linkage. \r\n\r\nA hub/category that receives ratings will tend to be collectors of items in that category, and so will have many feeder categories and many more items in the category than the hub that sends the ratings. The lower hub/category will want to download only a few of the most highly rated new items from the higher. The effect will be that highly rated items will rise in the hierarchy and be distributed back down to larger and larger domains. \r\n\r\nIt is important to realize that there is no requirement that the hierarchies all reach to a single global summit. There are bound to be semi-private enclaves that do not connect to the global level. Some categories of items will be too specialized to be wanted at global levels. Other categories of items will be proprietary and therefore not eligible for upload except within a particular sub-network. \r\n\r\nTo set the process in motion, InterMix software will have a number of hubs seeded in the database already at install time. A facility will be provided so that each hub that distributes the software can easily pre-load its own list of favorite hubs. \r\n\r\nThe basic elements for a global database, as laid out above, are hubs, participants, items, categories, ratings, linkages and linkage rules. In order to handle collective messages we will also need perspectives, groups, addresses, thresholds, listener groups and dialogue cycles. \r\n\r\nPerspectives are membership categories defined by participant attributes, such as country, political party, gender or occupation. A participant and the items he contributes or rates will automatically go into each of the several perspectives he belongs to. Perspectives are so named because when viewing the database contents from a perspective, the list of items sorted by rating will be sorted by average rating of perspective members, not by the average rating of all participants, allowing us to see the priority of items from the perspective of the group. An option will allow the list to be restricted to items contributed by the group members. \r\n\r\nEvery perspective is itself a \"group\", so Los Angeles participants as a whole form the LA group. The intersection of a perspective with other perspectives or categories is also a group. For instance, the \"basketball\" category from the Los Angeles perspective would form the LA Basketball discussion group, or Los Angeles participants who are chefs might form a group called \"What\'s Cooking, LA?\" \r\n\r\nCollective messages may be formal or spontaneous. Spontaneous collective messages are posted by group members at any time in a particular group and addressed from the group to either an individual or another group. Spontaneous collective message are \"sent\" only if they reach a preset \"send threshold\" for that group, at which point they are automatically delivered to the addressee, where they must be \"heard\" by a \"listener group\". A listener group is a small randomly selected sub-group of the addressed group. A listener group may or may not allow a collective message through to the larger group, depending on an adjustable formula involving average interest ratings by the listener group and total interest ratings by the sending group. Because we use total interest ratings from the sending group, therefore the size of the sending group comes into the formula indirectly, so a message from humanity will be more likely to be listened to than one from, say, San Francisco. \r\n\r\nBoth send and listener thresholds are adjustable by the group. An \"advanced controls\" page for each member of the group will have a number of slide bars showing the current group setting and allowing the user to slightly influence that setting by changing the position of the slide bar.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2004-08-14 15:08:04', '2004-08-14 15:08:04', NULL, NULL, 'Collective Communication, Inc.', NULL, 299, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Budget development is in fact a \"political\" act, with \"winners\" and \"losers\" most of whom never participate in the process.', 'Properly understood, budgets and the budget development process are tools through which social values are expressed and manifested in useful public activity. This pattern explains the importance of budgeting and encourages participation in all stages of budget development.\r\n\r\nPublic budgeting connects to several other patterns. For example: participating in the creation of budgets is an ideal way to foster <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=1\">Civic Intelligence</a> (pattern 1);  joint budget development helps create <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=9\">Shared Vision</a>  (pattern 9); public budgeting via online tools is an example of <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=26\">Using Collaborative Technologies for Civic Accountability</a> (pattern 26); and understanding budgets is one aspect of <a href=\"http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi/public?pattern_id=293\">Power Research</a> (pattern 293).', 'A fundamental step in the life of any organization is the design of a budget. The decisions which are made early in the process (e.g., What is to be budgeted for? What are the sources of income? Who is to be paid? What are the categories of effort which are highly compensated and what effort is to be considered voluntary?) often set core parameters for the future, and impact not only the ways in which time and money are spent, but also the values and reputation of the organization, and even its soul. \r\n\r\nBut budgeting is often treated as a \"technical\" process which should be handled by experts rather than as a political activity in which many people should be invited and encouraged to participate. One way in which budgets can be more easily discussed publicly is to use online tools to disseminate budget information, host public discussions, and create sample budget variations -- though from our experience, we believe this should be coupled with face-to-face discussions whenever possible.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.tve.org/lifeonline/index.cfm?aid=1110\">best-known example of participatory budgeting is found in Porto Alegre, Brasil</a>, where community residents (now numbering in the thousands) have cooperated since 1989 in annual deliberations about the allocation of a portion of the municipal budget. Poor citizens are vastly more engaged in this process than is typical in budgeting processes, and increasing proportions of the city\'s revenue have been directed towards improving the most impoverished parts of Porto Alegre. While there is some disagreement over how much of this outcome to attribute to the participatory budgeting process, there is no doubt about the increased sensitivity of all citizens to the importance of budgeting decisions. In June, 1996, the United Nations declared the \"popular administration\" of Porto Alegre as one of forth urban innovations at the Second Conference on Human Settlements.\r\n\r\nVarious <a href=\"http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/\">related experiments in participatory budgeting</a> have taken place on several continents since Porto Alegre, typically fine-tuned to local circumstances, with an evolving set of principles promoting conditions that enhance the effectiveness of the process.\r\n\r\nSeveral important attempts at involving typically excluded citizens in the budget allocation process have occurred in the U.S. -- often during progressive periods. Two of the most significant were the Affirmative Neighborhood Information Program during Mayor Harold Washington\'s tenure in Chicago (Kretzmann, 1992), which failed to survive successor administrations; and the Seattle Public Schools multi-year experiment in decentralized, \"school-based\" budgeting, supported by an online budgeting tool (Halaska, 2000). \r\n\r\nIn the Seattle experiment, a vastly increased proportion of district resources was redistributed from the central administrative offices to individual schools. School principals were encouraged to engage in a public budgeting process where trade-offs (e.g. reduced class size vs after-school music programs) were actively debated -- both in public meetings and online. The process was messy because \"democracy is messy\" and was controversial at every stage, in part because it surfaced hidden assumptions about core values in public education. Some participants believed that this process had the potential to provoke a fundamental rethinking of the purposes of the education process itself.\r\n\r\nKey findings from the Chicago and Seattle experiments align with the principles of Porto Alegre and elsewhere. For example, it is important that significantly different approaches to budgeting such as these become so embedded that they cannot readily be set aside by later regimes. Equally critical is that traditional budget staff be convinced about the importance of participatory budgeting. While philosophical and political discussions about larger scale budget issues can be done without technical assistance, detailed information about current costs and funding formulas typically reside with budget staff. Without their support, key budget information can be difficult to obtain. Moreover, while the ideology of participatory budgeting has wide appeal, critical studies should be undertaken to determine under what circumstances participatory strategies have lasting effects and whether, in the case of participatory budgeting for example, systemic changes such as in the labor market must occur for poorer citizens to benefit from these new strategies in the long run.', 'Budgets for organizations in the public sphere should be developed openly and inclusively, in public meetings and using publicly accessible online tools. Budget assumptions should be discussed, and rethinking of assumptions, priorities, and allocations should be encouraged, no matter how far they depart from current practice. At every stage, the results of the process should be made public for feedback and refinement. Attention should be paid to what has been learned from experience (for example, about the wisdom of convincing traditional budget staff of the utility of public budgeting), and studies of the long-range impact of participatory budgeting are essential.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2004-08-17 23:03:40', '2007-03-18 08:33:49', 'social design', NULL, 'University of Washington Evans School', NULL, 220, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

More than simply providing information, it helps people act upon that information in concordance with their needs and concerns. \r\nUnless some form of automated agent can perform as well as a person, Citizens\' Advice entails active mediation by qualified people. A website that consolidates information, such as reference 4, may be useful to clients but does not embody the essence of the pattern.\r\nCitizens\' Advice exists in countries with well-established social welfare structures. Much of the work concerns helping people to access resources to which they are entitled. At the same time, Citizens\' Advice helps people to understand and fulfill their responsibilities.\r\nTypically, Citizens\' Advice takes the form of regional agencies (Bureaux) under a national umbrella. In this way, funding can be accessed at a national level while individual bureaux specialize in regional resources and needs.\r\nThe central nature of a Citizens\' Advice service allows it to assist not only those who use information and resources but also those who provide them. To work toward providing information and resources that better address people\'s needs is an essential part of Citizens\' Advice. Citizens\' Advice Bureaux typically engage in social activism and setting social policy based upon the unmet needs that they identify through their contact with their clients. However, the extent to which this entails social activism is not intrinsic to the Citizens\' Advice pattern. Rather, the nature of any organization\'s social activism is the concern of other patterns (###such as...)\r\nThe notion of a central support agency to mediate between clients and resources goes beyond the Citizens\' Advice Bureaux established in, for example, New Zealand and the UK.

They are lead by people who are often chosen for their position only because they fit easily within the institution. Institutions become focused on their own survival rather than their original and evolving missions and visions. Institutions and organizations replicate themselves through their hiring practices and competitive practices, preventing diversity and hence, innovation. Institutions become resistant to change, maintaining the belief (at least implicitly) that \"who they are now is who they should remain\".', 'A distributed management and operational model for institutions is required to support and sustain remote and rural communities. \r\nEstablishing innovation as a way of doing business to engage remote and rural communities in all regions requires an appreciation where people are employed, where they are producing valued products as well as delivering services that are an important part of the social and economic fabric of the region. \r\nIn many cases, success in fulfilling the mission of an institution can actually mean the \"death\" or transformation of their organization. Institutions that have some specified lifespan to fulfill their mandate can either disappear or change to accommodate the next challenge that is identified from its work and services.', 'Most institutions are in place to deliver their services out from their operation centre to the region and the masses. Often, these institutions, their leaders and their corporate management models protect and maintain their existence without any respect for those that they were intended to serve. Their development and sustainability strategies are built and maintained on the basic values of greed and exploitation of the people and regions they claim to serve. The exploitation and destruction of the environment, the people and rural communities is the long term result of these types of efforts by institutions.\r\n\r\nRegional hospitals, colleges and universities are three examples of institutions that sustain their operation centres in larger urban environments. They sustain their operation by drawing people to their facilities using the myth that they will be better served if they move to these centres. The professionals who work with their clients in these institutions create a level of dependency that people have grown to accept. These efforts protect their positions and create wealth for the institution while draining local and regional resources. The reality that these institutions and corporations depend on these communities to supply the resources required for their existence challenges the traditional model of these environments.\r\n\r\nThe real costs of developing and sustaining centralized, concrete environments have never been incorporated into the balance sheets of the institutions. These real costs need to include the costs to the environment, the costs of the destruction of the forests and the earth to access the natural resources to create these man-made environments where people are \"taken care of\" so a few individuals can become rich and powerful. The artificial comforts that some individuals experience as a result of these environments need to reflect these real costs of producing the food and water that sustain the lives of the people who work within these institutions; the energy they consume to have these comforts; as well as the poverty that others must experience so they can be comfortable within these artificial environments. The list of real costs is long and requires a lot of research to reflect the realities that exist within the exchanges that occur between the different sectors of society.\r\n\r\nOnce these real costs are included in any true management system that reflect these different and real cost variables, then institutions and governments will need to begin looking outside of their \"glass bubbles\" to find truly sustainable and equitable solutions working with others. Management and program developers will need to find creative strategies to accommodate, work with and sustain communities, cultures and environments that have always existed and been struggling to survive. \r\n\r\nBeing able to look outside of their comfortable worlds to support innovation and development with their neighbours requires a new set of values and priorities. These institutional values and priorities will be different from those presently in place and used to protect and sustain these artificial and temporary facilities and environments. Partnering with others, trusting other people, understanding others, respecting other environments, cultures and people are values that need to become part of the any modern institutional culture and environment.\r\n\r\nSuch a transformation will benefit the institution by creating new opportunities and relationships. But it will also probably require some short term pain to establish the long term gains. Finding creative ways to purchase and support services and products from other groups outside of the institution also requires finding creative ways to pay the real price for these products and services. Learning how to value and respect the people in remote and rural communities and their environment helps create these new opportunities and relationships.\r\n\r\nWorking with existing institutions and supporting their required change is a challenge. Starting over to create new institutions is only an option when there are opportunities and support for innovative groups and organizations that are able to overcome or counter the traditional institutional management model. But for most existing institutions, the entrenched infrastructure and investments created over the years requires that they remain in place. \r\n\r\nInstitutions located in most small urban centres are an integral and historical part of their environment. Over the years they contribute jobs and significant investments in their communities where they are located. By their very nature, they will continue to exist but the question becomes, will they be able to make the necessary adjustments required to successfully accommodate these real operational costs within their own environments? \r\n\r\nThe type of change (along with the challenges and opportunities) being presented requires a transformation at all levels within existing institutions. This transformative work needs to be lead by innovative thinkers and new leaders who understand and respect the impact of their institution on the local, regional, national and international levels. The global village demands this type of relationship within institutions. As these new institutions evolve from within existing institutions or as new institutions are started, the required transformations are facilitated and supported by factors and forces that are within the organization and those that are outside of it.\r\n\r\nLeaders of older organizations often selected in the past are constrained by institutional routines, and may have resources that allow them to operate in counterproductive insulation from the environment. As leaders persist, they form bonds among themselves, develop common understandings of how things work, and select others like themselves to lead. Access to internal organizational resources can insulate them, in the short run, from environmental change. For a time, these resources may even give them the power to shape that environment  but only for a time. Changes in organizational structure that reduce leaders accountability to or need to mobilize resources from constituents  or changes in deliberative processes that suppress dissent  can diminish strategic capacity, even as resources grow. The strategic capacity of an organization can thus grow over time if it adjusts its leadership team to reflect environmental change, multiplies deliberative venues, remains accountable to salient constituencies, and derives resources from them. (Ganz, 2003)\r\n\r\nAs Ganz and others highlight there is a need for permeable organizations that are flexible, contain built in reality checks and are able to accommodate and reward innovative thinking (Thomas, 2002, Tresser, 2002, Wortley, 2002, Michaelson, 2002, Brown, 2006 and Dutfield, 2006). Working with groups and constituents outside of the institution provide the leadership with unique opportunities to adjust their goals and priorities.

How can information technology help?', 'The characterization of inadequate information technology resources in disadvantaged communities as a \"digital divide\" was a useful wake-up call. At the same time, this metaphor is often taken to imply a problematic solution: the one-way bridge (see figure above). The one-way bridge sees a technology-rich side at one end, and a technology-poor side at the other end. The one-way bridge attempts to bring gadgets to a place of absense, a sort of technology vacuum. This view can have the unfortunate side-effect of making local knowledge and expertise invisible or de-valued. However there are a variety of ways we can create a two-way bridge alternative.', 'One of the alternative approaches which avoids the one-way assumption is that of <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/csdt.html\">Culturally Situated Design Tools:</a> using information technology to \"translate\" from local knowledge (e.g. African indigenous designs, African American vernacular practices, Native American traditions, etc.) to their high-tech counterparts in mathematics, computer graphics, architecture, agriculture, medicine, and science. The graphic above shows a simulation of an African American cornrow hairstyle. We also have design tools that provide a virtual bead loom for simulating Native American beadwork, virtual graffiti, etc. Each design tools makes use of the mathematics embedded in the practive--for example the virtual bead loom uses Cartesian coordinates, because of the four-fold symmetry of the traditional loom (and many other Native American designs such as the \"four winds\" healing traditions, the four-pole tipi, etc). We found statistically significant increases in both math acheivement and attitudes toward IT careers for minority students who have had extensive use of the design tools.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative approach is that of <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/eglash.dir/apptech.htm\">Appropriated Technologies</a>. Most social studies of science and technology have focused on either production by established professionals, or the impact on the general public. But what about the lay public as *producers* of technology and science? From the vernacular engineering of Latino car design to environmental analysis among rural women, groups outside the centers of scientific power persistently defy the notion that they are merely passive recipients of technological products and scientific knowledge. Rather, there are many instances in which they reinvent these products and rethink these knowledge systems, often in ways that embody critique, resistance, or outright revolt.\r\n\r\nA summary of these two approaches for creating a \"two-way bridge\" is visualized in the image below.', 'Culturally Situated Design Tools and Appropriated Technologies are just two of a number of potential strategies for avoiding the \"one way bridge.\" I hope readers of this pattern will contribute additional ideas for the two-way approach.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-03-04 09:54:56', '2005-08-01 10:12:11', NULL, NULL, 'rpi', NULL, 306, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

It is their work which inspires this pattern and many of the ideas advanced in this pattern originated in their writings. Disclaimer: The concept of a \"Global Peoples Parliament\" comes from Richard Falk and Andrew Strauss. The version advocated here is not \"official\" (nor authoritative). \r\n\r\nCivil society is obligated to create institutions that are strong enough to challenge other organization -- governments, businesses, criminal groups, extremists -- but not on <i>their</i> terms.\r\n\r\nThis pattern has only partial analogs in the \"real world.\" This is due, generally, to the extremely broad scope of its coverage &mdash; it is supposed to address <I>all</I> of the world\'s inhabitants! The very fact of globalization provides the most solid support (and for the <I>need</I>) of the World Citizen Parliament pattern. Smaller versions that approximate some aspects of this pattern do, of course, exist, and we can learn a lot from these experiments as we attempt to cultivate and grow democratic forms that are more wide-ranging. The European Parliament may be the most prominent example of a large civic society institution whose representatives are democratically elected by people from various countries.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is related to INDEPENDENT REGIONS, the first pattern in <i>A Pattern Language.</i> Alexander was striving to identify the right level of autonomy based on \"natural limits to the size of groups that can govern themselves in a human way.\" Metropolitan regions will not come to balance until each one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent sphere of culture. That pattern\'s solution states that, \"Wherever possible, work toward the evolution of independent regions in the world; each with a population between 2 and 10 million; each with its own natural and geographic boundaries; each with its own economy; each one autonomous and self-governing; each with a seat in a world government, without the intervening power of larger states or countries.\" \r\n\r\nAlexander\'s pattern and ours have similarities and differences. Both presuppose an increased voice of the citizen through additional opportunities for participation and new collective bodies that are independent from governments as they now exist. At first glance the two approaches might seem incompatible &mdash; Alexander\'s pattern does not call for an all-citizen\'s body nor does this pattern mention autonomous regions. The parliament concept, however, does not rule out autonomous, independent regions per se, only that individual people would have a forum for addressing issues was outside of their independent region &mdash; or what looks very much like a <i>country</i> but with new boundaries that better reflected cultural and natural boundaries (which does little or nothing about addressing the realities of various cultural or ethnic or religious groups \"stranded\" behind redrawn boundaries). Moreover, the state conceptualized in Alexander\'s pattern could actually be attained in a more \"natural\" evolutionary way through this pattern. \r\n\r\nDeveloping a top-down approach is neither viable nor consonant with the principles of civil society. This leaves us with the option of developing principles and ideas that are we believe are at the core of what a federation should be and allows the parliament grow or evolve, built from the seeds that we envision today. This envisioned global federation would then become a type of ecosystem for collective bodies. [Ideally it would be principled and explicitly cooperative -- but how to ensure? At the same time we would need to ensure that it doesn\'t become just another arena for people to exploit for their own interests. Use the Commons ideas from Bollier, Ostrom and others, for one thing. The World Social Forum provides many important ideas about how this could be accomplished. What distinguishes this from how things exist already is an explicit declaration and decision to participate in the project, to share information with others and to communicate with other collectives in the federation.\r\n\r\nCollective groups are generally composed of people in a geographically delimited area (some of whom have passed certain formal requirements for membership and attained the status of citizen), of people with similar professional interests (e.g. medical associations or labor unions), or social aims or philosophy (American Civil Liberties Union, American Rifle Association, etc. ) \r\n\r\nThe draft statement that I proposed at the Online Deliberation Conference / Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing Symposium, Stanford University, on May 22, 2005, sums up the important aspects of this pattern.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In many places attempts are being made to trivialize citizenship and reconstitute citizens as (everyday) consumers and (sporadic) voters. Real power is in many ways being transferred to large corporations and other unelected organizations such as the World Trade Organization. \r\n\r\nRealizing the growing and critical importance of citizens and civic society in addressing humankind\'s common problems, we the undersigned propose the initiation of a \"Grand Challenge\" whose ultimate objective is the development of a World Citizen Parliament. We realize that this is an extremely complex project that will require years of complex, nuanced, creative and thoughtful negotiation and collaboration. We are aware that this project will have to address an extremely broad range of social and cross-cultural factors. We, however, believe that beginning this discussion in an explicit and open way is preferable to many other varieties of globalization that lack this transparency.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we realize that precisely defining an ideal system in advance is impossible. For that reason, we propose to begin a principled, long-term, incremental, participatory design process that integrates experimental, educational, community mobilization, research and policy work all within a common intellectual orientation: specifically to provide an inclusive intellectual umbrella for a diverse, distributed civil society effort. We realize &mdash; of course &mdash; that this is an audacious proposal. However, we agree with Richard Falk, that a parliament or forum like this is critical for the future of humankind and our planet. Civil society historically is the birthplace of socially ameliorative visions. This effort is intended to help build a more effective platform for these efforts, to help address humankind\'s shared problems &mdash; such as environmental degradation, human rights abuses, economic injustice and war &mdash; that other sectors &mdash; notably government and business &mdash; are seemingly powerless to stem. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nUltimately we would expect that the recommendations that are issued will play important roles in policy development of the future as well as in our ways of thinking. Each of the experiments that we undertake in the next few years will undoubtedly have drawbacks, some of which will be revealed only as people attempt to address real concerns. Information and communication technology will play an important role in many of these projects and people in these fields will need to work with social scientists, representatives from civil society organizations and many others if a World Citizen Parliament that sensitively, fairly, and wisely explores and addresses the concerns of the under-represented citizens of the world is ever created.', 'Launch a non-centralized, heterogeneous, loosely-linked network of people, online and offline resources, institutions, deliberative and other collaborative settings.

A related problem, which may be more insidious, arises when two or more people think they\'re speaking the same language when they\'re not. \"Languages,\" furthermore, are of various types, in addition to what we usually think of &mdash; English, Japanese, or Hindi, for example. Some people seem to speak only \"Technical\" or \"Post Modern Academician\" which can be incomprehensible from outside those cultures. Finally, there is often an implied \"pecking order\" in which one language (and its speakers) are viewed as dominant or more important while other languages (and its speakers) are devalued and bear an unequal share of the burden of understanding.', 'This pattern applies in any situation where two or more languages are employed. Here \"language\" is applied broadly. For example, with global climate change looming, scientists must be able to engage in two-way conversations effectively; social scientists must be able to do the same if their work is to have relevance and resonance. Translation takes place when any two worlds of discourse are bridged.', 'This includes translation between systems of knowledges (e.g. theorist to practitioner) as well as translations between different languages.\r\n\r\n<i>\"A text is a machine for eliciting translations.\" </i> &mdash; Umberto Eco, Translating and Being Translated\r\n\r\nAlthough cultures are maintained through a variety of institutions, the use of a common language may be the deepest and most abiding tie that binds a culture together. Language is a reflection of, and a window into, culture.\r\n\r\nOf course people speak many languages; children may invent secret words to describe the world they see and would like to see, Slang is shared by youth culture, academic disciplines use certain phrases, neolisms etc. to participate in a shared intellectual pursuit, while religious communities have expressions of sacred and profane ideas of special significance. \r\n\r\nIf, however, every person in the world spoke only one language, a language that had no words in common, then each group would be, in essence, a group by itself cut off from the rest of the social world.  Trade would be virtually impossible as would diplomacy and sharing of intellectual creations, technological and artistic.  War is one social activity that probably would not be hampered by this barrier to communication (although negotiating an end to the hostilities would be extremely difficult, if not possible.) \r\n\r\nThus translation is a bridge that connects two or more cultures or two or more people. Translation allows two or more groups or people to come to a common understanding and it allows them to take advantage of the special or expert knowledge of the other.\r\n\r\nTranslation is also a social process that is embedded in particular social contexts and is subjected to the dictates of that context. For example, the burden of translation is often expected to fall upon the lower status or less dominant group. Thus, many Spanish speakers in the U.S. are \"expected\" to learn English (majority rules &mdash; in more ways than one). People who lack fluency in the dominant language (English, BBC English, or Techno-speak, for example) are often considered ignorant. \r\n\r\nUmberto Eco captures a key difficulty in translation: <blockquote>\"Equivalence in meaning cannot be take as a satisfactory criterion for a correct translation, first of all because in order to define the still undefined notion of translation one would have to employ a notion as obscure as equivalence of meaning, and some people think that meaning is that which remains unchanged in the process of translation. We cannot even accept the naïve idea that equivalence in meaning is provided by synonymy, since it is commonly accepted that there are no complete synonyms in language. Father is not a synonym for daddy, daddy is not a synonym for papà, and père is not a synonym for padre.\" <br />&nbsp;&mdash; Umberto Eco (2001).</blockquote>As Eco makes clear in the quotations above, words in languages dont have one-to-one equivalence.  For that reason successful translation relies on a reasonable yet partial solution (actually a type of <i>negotiation</i>) to a number of interdependent problems. Totally accurate translation is impossible but imperfect translation is ubiquitous &mdash; and essential. Moreover, the context of the words in the sentence, the sentence in the paragraph, etc. etc. that is being translated, all within the context of the inspiration and intent and audience are all relevant when translating.\r\n\r\nTranslation, therefore, is not a mechanical act, but a skilled and empathetic re-rewriting or re-performing of a text or utterance or intention in which an understanding of the two cultures being bridged is essential. More precisely, an understanding of the two respective audiences, intended and otherwise, the vocabulary they employ, their education, biases, fears, etc. are all central to a good, solid and mutually satisfactory translation. \r\n\r\nAlthough the following quotation is specifically examining the differences of psychology and sociology by their focus of individuals and collective bodies respectively, it captures a central question in translation. <blockquote>To address the problem of different and incommensurable perspectives in the human sciences, two issues need to be considered. First, we must find a way to link perspectives without simply reducing one to another. One guiding assumption of this volume is that attempts to account for complex human phenomena by invoking a perspective grounded in a single discipline are as unlikely as were the attempts of each of the three blind men to come with <em>the</em> true account of an elephant. The goal, then, is to arrive at an account &mdash; a kind of \"translation at the crossroads\" &mdash; that would make it possible to <em>link, but not reduce,</em> one perspective to another. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; James V. Wertsch (1998)  </blockquote>', 'Think about the critical role of translation and, if possible, become a translator &mdash; or at least when the need arises where you can help bridge a gap of understanding.  From the point-of-view of social amelioration translations between two particular cultures may be of more immediate than two others.

For about polls I see online, I sometimes want to vote for \"None of the above\" or \"The question is missing the point\", but choices like these are rarely available.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s needed is a idea exchange application that balances off the need for individual contribution with the need for summarization and dedeuplication of content for the casual reader.', 'I\'m proposing a solution which is a hybrid between a message board newsgroup application which I\'m calling a discussion poll.\r\n\r\nThe specific solution I\'m proposing involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n* An organizer setups up an initial question and set of choices for that question.  \r\n\r\n* The choices are presented to participants in the order of those choices with the most votes listed first.\r\n\r\n* Participants can vote for choices *and* write-in new choices.\r\n\r\n* Participants are allowed to change their vote to new choices as interesting choices \"bubble up\".\r\n\r\nDifficulties\r\n\r\nThis application is sensitive to initial choices in the poll.   Moderation and vetting procedures are necessary to make sure \"write-in choices\" are not redundant suggestions or other types of noise that will destroy people\'s ability to review new low vote count choices.\r\n\r\nInitially, this moderation can be done by hand.  Eventually, more automated moderation can be implemented based on vetting by users with a good voting history. \r\n\r\nEven with moderation of new choices, this sort of application is susceptible to people ganging up to vote on their own previously accepted new choices to get the new choices out of the \"noise\" of the low vote count choices.   \r\n\r\nTo combat this there would also need to be views of discussion/voting booths that present alternate selections of newly accepted choices.   Specifically:\r\n\r\n* A random selection of newly accepted choices.\r\n\r\n* A selection of newly accepted choices with authors who have a voting history that typically predicts winning choices (aka \"good\" voting histories)\r\n\r\n* A selection of newly accepted choices where people who have voted for those choices have \"good\" voting histories.\r\n\r\nThere can be many variations on the trust feedback mechanisms and they will need to dynamically change as users try and spam the system.   A good example of this is Slashdot.org which uses multiple, unpublished, and changing criteria to assign \"Karma\" to users.   It should be pointed out that this application is tuned towards a less sophisticated audience than websites like SlashDot.org\r\n\r\nLastly, in terms of difficulties, preventing a participant from voting multiple times is difficult as there is no easy way of uniquely identifying a person on the internet.    While there is no way to easily prevent this for a new system, as participants build up histories, it should be possible to detect voting booths that have an unusually high percentage of new voters.\r\n\r\nThere is one way to uniquely identify users on the internet that is applicable in some situations.

This is often the unfortunate by-product of poverty; education is out reach of the majority of the majority of the world\'s population and access to media tools (including cameras, editing software, recording studios, the Internet) and other systems is often prohibitively expensive. Although this situation can be debilitating to people who are caught in those circumstances, the rest of society suffers as well: they are deprived of stories and perspectives that could enrich their understanding of the world while preparing them to become better citizens of the world &mdash; and their local community.', 'Anybody with a story to tell &mdash; and this includes everybody &mdash; could benefit from this pattern. This pattern, however, specifically addresses those people with little to no access to media production of any kind. Although this pattern focuses on the people who lack the access, implementation of this pattern often requires the assistance of people and organizations who have both the resources and interest in working with people in a participatory way.', 'The story told in the 2004 documentary \"Born into Brothels\" is an excellent example of this pattern. In 1997, New York-based photographer Zana Briski traveled to India to document the lives of women, children and men who lived in Calcutta\'s impoverished red light district. During the next three years, some of which was spent living in the brothels, Briski noticed that many of the children of the prostitutes were fascinated by her photographic equipment. Soon she started giving them cameras and helping them to use them as a new lens to look at their world. Later she organized shows at galleries for the photographs and made the photographs available on the Internet. The money from the sales is now being used to help support the children\'s education. While raising money for the worthy cause of education &mdash; and raising the consciousness of millions of others who watched the documentary &mdash; is exemplary, the most important outcome of the project may be the increased awareness and perception that seemed to be unlocked in the children by the acts of observing and recording their surroundings with the camera.\r\n\r\nWhile the Homemade Media pattern is not a panacea it does have many possible benefits. The first benefit is of course that learning to create media helps build skills and as such may lead to employment. Regardless of that, however, it helps build confidence and self-esteem. These positive attitudes about oneself and the desire to keep persisting in the craft of creating media &mdash; whether photography, interviews, audio recordings, or newspapers &mdash; is a good defense against self-destructive behaviors such as alcohol or other drug abuse or gang activity or criminal outlets. The act of capturing an image in a camera\'s viewfinder or writing down fragments of overheard conversations or otherwise <i>recording</i> promotes the idea of reflection upon various aspects of life or the imagination. \r\n\r\nMedia is inherently shareable in some way. Photographs can displayed for viewing in galleries, printed in magazine or hung on public walls. Videos can be shown on televisions or in theatres. These can be artistic, informational, or lead to social change in some way. In any case, however, they can be used to communicate with others. Homemade Media can open up channels of communication with people, as audience or as potential partners for additional collaboration. \r\n\r\nA few other examples can show a little more of the breadth of the pattern: Drawings of children in Darfur present the horror of genocide that is hard to shake off. Gumball Poetry (http://www.gumballpoetry.com/) allows people to buy a short poem from a gumball machine for 25 cents. One of the most remarkable projects, however, took place in Bogoto, Colombia. Film-maker Felipe Aljure developed the Rebeldes con Cauce project in which he worked with 140 young people with no filmmaking experience to help them learn how to make films (Dowmunt, 1988). Most of the students were from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. They studied film, developed outlines and created ten to fifteen minute films which were ultimately aired on Bogota\'s channel Canal Capital where they received \"outstanding\" ratings. \r\n\r\nThe Plugged In Project in East Palo Alto helped teach underprivileged youths how to create web pages that told their stories (while teaching them a skill, self-confidence, etc.) from celebrating Thanksgiving holiday with their family to witnessing the seizure of a family member by immigration officials for now have the appropriate papers to remain in the country. \r\n\r\nThe homeless newspaper movement is active in many cities around the world. Although it takes different forms in different cities, the basic model is the same: The newspaper concentrates on issues of homelessness and poverty, two subjects that are likely to be covered sensitively or in much depth by mainstream media. Beyond that the newspaper is often actively engaged in the struggle for the rights of poor people and engages poor people and their communities in every aspect of the newspaper production and distribution.  The Real Change weekly newspaper in Seattle is sold by people who are homeless or otherwise in underprivileged positions for $1.00 and receive 70 cents for each paper sold. \r\n\r\nSolution: The Homemade Media can be applied in a million ways.

More recently, communities arose directly online: this is for instance the case of blogs/bloggers communities. \r\nRegardless the different contexts, online communities are complex socio-technical systems. However, while large amounts of efforts have been made ', 'While the socio-technical nature of online communities is manifest and there exists nowadays a huge literature concerning online communities which deals with topics such as their sociological aspects, organizational impacts and the role communities can play is a variety of contexts (within the organizations as well as in the society), much less attention has been payed to technology  issues. Actually, the sociological analysis and the identification of general requirements technology should satisfy - for instance, usability (cf. Preece, 2000) up to now does not provide clear hints to software developers.\r\n\r\nThe most relevant attempt to identify the features which an appropriate technological platform for supporting online communities should provide has been made probably by Etienne Wenger. In his extensive survey (Wenger, 2001), now in a revision and upgrading phase (http://www.technologyforcommunities.com), Wenger identifies a set of critical factors for the success of a community of practice (CoP) and their technological implications for the supportive tools in terms of a list of features (the list has 73 items) that an online community environment should have if it wants to satisfy its members needs. \r\n\r\nInspired by Wengers work, through the analysis of software used for managing virtual community (PhpBB, PhpNuke) and community networks (such as FreePort and CSuite) and through our direct experience of managing several online communities (first of all community networks which constitute our basic competence, De Cindio et al, 2004) with different software, we have worked out a higher-level classification of the macro-functionalities a Online Community Services Engine should provide, which is:<ul><li> homogeneous, since each macro-functionality is at the same level of abstraction of the others;</li><li>complete, since the seven macro-functionalities captures the essential of a fully-featured online community service engine; </li><li> general enough to be applied to any kinds of online community: communities of practice, community networks, communities of interests, learning communities, etc. </li></ul>The outcome is the following list of macro-functionalities an online community service engine should provide: <ol><li>Users Management characterizes community members and provide different and personalized views. Allow to discriminate among different levels of access to the community resources. This group include members directory, access rights, profiles, etc.</li><li>Communication and dialog include all the typical synchronous and asynchronous communication tools such as email, discussion boards, blogs, private messages, chats, etc.</li><li> Information and publishing allow community members to manage contents for publishing like with a standard content management system (CMS), but - which we believe essential in an Online Community Services Engine - an effective integration with the communication and dialog dimension (Benini et al, 2005).</li><li>Community awareness gives members the sense of belonging to a community that is characterized by rules, roles, history, customs, etc. Examples of these features are: presence awareness (who is online), reputation and ranking, personal history, subscriptions, distinctive look and feel.</li><li>Calendaring includes the features for storing personal or community events or appointments by date, together with reminders features and the possibility of sharing calendars among members based on access rights.</li><li>Workgroups support features. These features are based on the possibility to restrict members access to community resources like forums, upload file areas, calendars, etc. </li><li>Monitoring and statistics, i.e., the features for keeping track of accesses, number of posts, liveliness of forums, moderators reliability, etc.; it to trace the health indicators of the community.</li></ol>Beside these general purpose macro-functionalities, an Online Community Services Engine should be able to be integrated with modules that offer features relevant for any specific (type of) community. For example teaching modules for learning communities, deliberation facilities for civic and community networks.\r\n \r\nFor making possible the merge of the basic functionalities with the dedicated features necessary to support specific (type of) communities, the Online Community Services Engine:<ul><li>must have an overall modular architecture for integrating not built-in functionalities;</li><li>its User Management component must be able to supply authentication and authorization services to external add-on components or tools (while most of the user management components of the software used to implement online communities - e.g. PHPNuke - do not accept authentication requests from external modules); </li></ul>Both these requirements have the effect of opening the Online Community Services Engine through standard protocols, so facilitating cross-community communication. For the same purpose, the Online Community Services Engine should include those features, such as RSS feeds, which enhance information exchanges.\r\n\r\nThis is possible if the Online Community Services Engine is implemented over standard base-technologies, such as the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to handle authentications and authorizations and web services for providing standard interoperability among modules.', 'The classification of the macro-functionalities an Online Community Services Engine should provide, together with the associated architectural requirements, challenge researchers and practitioners to implement and deploy an Online Community Services Engine tailorable by the community that uses it; i.e., each deployment of the engine should be created as an instance of the engine including the set of functionalities necessary to the specific online community. The opening requirement naturally calls for developing the software using open source software tools.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the resulting classification, rather than for implementation purposes, can be seen also as a check list to make a choice of among available software (proprietary or not).', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-07-26 03:14:16', '2007-03-18 08:06:22', 'RCM - Milan Community Network - Italy', NULL, 'University of Milano', NULL, 160, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

How do they change as languages and cultures evolve through different communication technologies?  In the age of cyberspace we often feel alienated from genuine stories, ones that we live with every day, that tell us how to become decent human beings and live meaningful lives. Corporate media exploit story patterns that evolved to pass on ethical codes, and we are trapped into thinking about products instead of reflecting on our lives.  Traditional myths explored dynamic relationships between humans and nature. How can stories to help us adapt to our quickly changing world?', 'This pattern addresses the concerns of organizations and individuals involved in: Education, Culture, Arts, Society, Mythology, Technology, Law, Philosophy, Humanities, Psychology, Science, Environmental Studies, Religion, Social & Political Science, and Activism.', '<i>One way or another we are living the stories planted in us early or along the way, or we are also living the stories we plantedknowingly or unknowinglyin ourselves. We live stories that either give our lives meaning or negate it with meaninglessness.  If we change the stories we live by, quite possibly we change our lives. </i>   Ben Okri, Nigerian storyteller\r\n\r\nPatterns in stories tend to reflect the environments we live in and the communication media we use. Indigenous peoples evolved patterns in oral traditions that resonated with the voices of the land and reinforced memory and meaning.  The invention of writing and the phonetic alphabet played with the way language and images could be displayed as texts.  The advent of the printing press offered freedom to experiment with new narrative and poetic forms, as well as restraints, as texts and language became standardized. The structure of stories changed as they moved from the places they were told onto the printed page. \r\n\r\nToday, can words again become winged as they fly through both time and space in new forms offered by electronic media?  Speech is communal; it exists only as it is being shared.  As stories shift and change in response to new environments and technologies, who has access and jurisdiction to manipulate them? Can these new mediums offer opportunities to engage our senses and help us reconnect to the natural world?  Can this enriched experience help us reflect on the deeper messages that stories contain? \r\n\r\nStories are conduits or vehicles that mediate our inner and outer worlds.  When we tell stories, we are connected to live events and internal dramas.  Modern cultures utilize technology to record ideas or performances, and tend to value the analysis of texts, recordings, and other artifacts of expression.  We cultivate methods of reflection that reinforce our capacity to respond, think, and explore symbolic messages, but our objectivity makes us feel removed or alienated from authentic experience. We often yearn for the mystery of stories to deepen our lives.\r\n\r\nOral cultures are immersed in ritual and experience; the time, place, and context in which a story is told is crucial to its meaning.  Myths, which convey symbolic messages, are also repositories or living encyclopedias of practical knowledge and wisdom gained from sustainable relationships to the natural world.  Oral traditions resonate with mnemonic patterns, poetic rhythms, tones, and inflections of local landscapes. \r\n\r\nRichard Louve points out that studies of the songs of birds and whales reveal many of the same laws of composition as those used by humans. New scientific methods have enabled humans to learn about the intricate patterns of human and animal communication, but have not given most children a deep or genuine experience of animals and the stories or songs grounded in the natural world. This results in what Love describes as the modern childs hyper-intellectualized perception of nature and other animals.\r\n\r\nTechnology gives us tools to analyze and preserve traditional stories, but also disrupts and alienates people from meaningful stories that connect them with sustainable patterns in the natural world.  Modern myths are often caught up in the social, political, and economic systems that our new technologies have created. Those who control the stories, knowledge, and mediums of communication wield the power. \r\n\r\nMarsahll McLuhan explores the shadow side of technological and economic success by arguing that popular culture is a source for diagnosing the collective trance of industrial society.  Ads are a new kind of storytelling; a social ritual or magic that enhances us in our own eyes.  Rolf Jensen says, The highest-paid person in the first half of the next century will be the storyteller. Many global companies are mainly storytellers, and the value of products depends on the story they tell.  Advertisers proclaim freedom of choice as the foundation of the American way of life; however, they gloss over questions of power and control.  McLuhan suggests that individuals break the hypnotic trance of the media through tough-minded evaluation that probes the collective myths of our industrial folklore. \r\n\r\nMythologist Joseph Campbell says, not only have the old mythic notions of the nature of the cosmos gone to pieces, but also those of the origins of the history of mankind.  He suggests, that to give meaning to life, the modern person cannot simply reproduce inherited patterns of thought or action, but must create their own stories.  Since many people start with seeds provided by the media, how do they proceed?\r\n\r\nWords and stories are active agents. Ernest Cassirer says that the word, in early cosmologies, is the primary force from which being and doing originate.  Likewise, the cause and effect of media and print word magic in modern cultures determines our political and economic systems, and can result in nationalism and colonialism.  Traditional stories and myths that have evolved from oral, consensually shared standards and beliefs that value feeling and community interaction have come into conflict with technologies that value independence, analytical thought, and scientific or secular authority. Modern civilization is faced with a split between the head and the heart. \r\n\r\nIn the Greek myth of the phonetic alphabet, King Cadmus plants dragons\' teeth (alphabetic symbols) that rise up as armed men. If the alphabet could have such effects, what is the effect of modern technologies? We face the problem of how to deal ethically with the power humans have manufactured through technology. Can we recover a sense of reverence for the word without fueling tribal or national myths that sew dragons teeth?  \r\n\r\nThoreau anticipated these arguments in Walking, when he says, There are other letters for the child to learn than those which Cadmus invented.  Rather than learning letters in dusty schools, Thoreau wanted students to learn from wilderness.  For him, mythology came close to expressing the language of nature.  He advocates a kind of tawny grammar that celebrates what is wild and free.  Through this, he says, The highest that we can attain is not Knowledge, but Sympathy with Intelligence. \r\n\r\nPerhaps McLuhan suggests a solution to our dilemma when he says, two cultures or technologies can, like astronomical galaxies, pass through one another without collision; but not without change of configuration. Are we ready for a transformation of this magnitude? Can we connect traditional stories and myths with new technologies in ways that dont hypnotize us into a trance, but actually engage us more completely with community and the natural world?', 'Storytelling, an ancient art, needs to be rediscovered and updated. Stories help humankind to understand, reinterpret, and reframe the meanings that under-gird their existence. Can we use new communications technologies to weave together words and images, scientific information and poetic inspiration, and incorporate multiple voices (including the larger community of plants, animals, birds, and elemental forces) to tell multi-faceted stories of our earth communities?  Can stories help us to weave together the communications and global challenges that face us as we learn to live co-creatively with each other and the natural world?', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-07-27 16:34:01', '2007-03-22 09:48:25', NULL, NULL, 'The Evergreen State College', NULL, 314, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(626, 606, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'The characterization of inadequate information technology resources in disadvantaged communities as a \"digital divide\" was a useful wake-up call. At the same time, this metaphor is often taken to imply a problematic solution: the one-way bridge. The one-way bridge sees a technology-rich side at one end, and a technology-poor side at the other end. The one-way bridge attempts to bring gadgets to a place of absense, a sort of technology vacuum. This view can have the unfortunate side-effect of making local knowledge and expertise invisible or de-valued.', 'One of the alternative approaches which avoids the one-way assumption is that of Culturally Situated Design Tools: using computer simulations of cultural arts and other pracitces to \"translate\" from local knowledge to their high-tech counterparts in mathematics, computer graphics, architecture, agriculture, medicine, and science. Current design tools include a virtual bead loom for simulating Native American beadwork, a tool based on urban graffiti, an audio tool for simulating Latino percussion rhythms, a Yupik navigation simulation, etc. Each design tools makes use of the mathematics embedded in the practive--for example the virtual bead loom uses Cartesian coordinates, because of the four-fold symmetry of the traditional loom (and many other Native American designs such as the \"four winds\" healing traditions, the four-pole tipi, etc). Applications are primarily in K-12 math education, but they also can be applied to design projects such as architecture, or used as a research tool in investigations such as ethnomathematics.', 'Although we have had some strong success with these tools, their deployment--particularly in the field of education--has not been easy. In the educational context, we first have to work with community members to find a cultural practice that can be simulated. In the case of Native American practices some of the best examples in terms of ethnomathematics turn out to be sacred practices that cannot be simulated (eg Navajo sand painting, Shoshone whirling disks). Second, we have to make sure the cultural practice is recognized by the youth -- several African examples were questioned because by teachers who said African American children would see them more as dusty museum artifacts than as something they had cultural ownership of. Third we have to satisfy the requirements of standard curricula -- many interesting examples of ethnomathematics (Eulerian paths in pacific Islander sand drawings, fractals in African architecture, etc.) are difficult to use because they are outside of the standard curriculum. Fourth the software support must be easy for teachers to use -- many math teachers (particularly those serving large minority populations) do not have ready access to good quality computers for their students, and do not have good technolgical training. The students must be provided with cultural background information and tutorials, and the teachers must be provided with lesson plans and examples of use.', 'Our first design tool was developed for the \"African Fractals\" project (Eglash 1999). Mathematics teachers with large African American student populations reported that they could not use fractals -- there was too much pressure to conform to the standard curriculum -- and that they felt that many of the examples were too culturally distant from the students. They all felt that the examples of hairstyles would work well however. Thus our first tool focused on the hairstyles, and used the term \"iterative transformational geometry\" rather than \"fractals.\"  The graphic above shows the result, called \"Cornrow Curves.\" \r\n\r\nEach braid is represented as multiple copies of a Y shaped plait. In each iteration, the plait is copied, and a transformation is applied. The series of transformed copies creates the braid. In the above example, we can see the original style at top right, and a series of braid simulations, each composed of plait copies that are successively scaled down, rotated, and translated (reflection is only applied to whole braids, as in the case where one side of the head is a mirror image of the other). One of the interesting research outcomes was that our students discovered which parameters need to remain the same and which would be changed in order to produce the entire series of braids (that is, how to iterate the iterations).\r\n\r\nThe cultural background section of the website is divided into how to (for those unfamiliar with the actual process of creating cornrow hairstyles) and an extensive cultural history of cornrow hairstyles. We have found that many students, even those of African American heritage, will tell us that cornrows were invented in the 1960s. The history section was developed to provide students with a more accurate understanding of that history, starting with their original context in Africa (where they were used to signify age, religion, ethnic group, social status, kinship, and many other meanings), the use of cornrows in resistance to the attempt at cultural erasure during slavery, their revival during the civil rights era, and their renaissance in hip-hop. Most importantly, we want students to realize that the cornrows are part of a broader range of scaling designs from Africa (Eglash 1999), and that they represent a part of this African mathematical heritage that survived the middle passage. \r\n\r\nAs noted previously, we have since developed a wide variety of design tools, ranging from simulations of Mayan pyramids (see image below) to virtual baskets. Our evaluations have been based on pre-test/post-test comparisons of mathematics performance, average grades in mathematics classes (comparing a year with the tools to the previous year without), and scores on a survey of interest or engagement with IT (specifically computing careers). All three measures show statistically significant increase (p < .05 or better) with use of these tools. \r\n\r\nIn summary, we note that any attempts to re-value local or traditional knowledge in the face of oppressive histories will be challenging, and all the more so if the re-valuation has to compete with current mainstream global practices. But we feel that Culturally Situated Design Tools offer an important new position in which to engage that struggle.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-07-28 09:57:02', '2007-03-13 08:01:06', NULL, NULL, 'rpi', NULL, 306, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

(627, 607, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'We usually think of technology as that which is designed by elite groups -- mostly male, mostly white, mostly upper class, etc. But the lay public can also be thought of as producers of technology and science. The \"smiley face\" emoticons we use in email, for example, were not designed by experts; it was ordinary people taking advantage of a flexibility in the system. Technology appropriation can be profound: Latino \"street mechanics\" for example created the Low Rider car which revolutionized their culture. Black teenagers created the \"scratch\" sound of rap by appropriating the turntable. Appropriated technology can help the disenfrachised gain social power. But there are three barriers. First, marginalized people often see science and technology as the enemy, a force to be resisted. Second, marginalized people often lack the education and physical resources for technology interventions. And third, designers (or at least the corporations they work for) do not necessarily see flexibility as something they should incorporate in their products. Of course not all cases of appropriated technology are happy stories: neo-nazi groups are also outside the centers of scientific production, and they too adapt and reinvent to gain power.', 'Barrier 1: science and technology as the enemy. Social critics of often cite \"technocracy\" as the evil which perpetuates disparity in social power. Thus oppositional groups which subscribe to this theory will tend to desire less technology and not more. We see this in the 1960s counter-culture, in the conflation of technology with patriarchy, and in race-based movements that see an original \"natural\" or \"pure\" identity that was later defiled by colonialism.\r\nBarrier 2: science and technology as unattainable. Our society tends to mythologize expertise, particularly that of science and technology, making lay interventions less attainable than they actually are. Many researchers suspect this serves to maintain elite priviledge and passive consumption.\r\nBarrier 3: designing for rigidity: Corporations can increase profits by forcing consumers to use their products or engage in limited behaviors: for example Microsoft\'s operating system created barriers to competing internet browsers.', 'In collecting the various case studies for our anthology (Eglash et al 2004), it became apparent that some examples made a stronger case for appropriation than others. Using that distinction, we developed the following three categories. You can think of these as being positioned along a spectrum from consumption to production (see figure above). \r\n\r\nThe weakest case, \"reinterpretation,\" is defined by a change in semantic association with little or no change in use or structure. That is, the lay person has changed only the meaning of the artifact, not its physical make up. Graffiti tags are a good illustration: the physical and functional aspects of a building are essentially unchanged, but the semantic claim to ownership, as a form of either cultural resistance or criminal turf war,is not trivial. The next stronger case, \"adaptation,\" is defined by a change in both semantic association and use. For example, the Bedouin society of Egypt, a relatively disempowered ethnic minority, found that cassette tape players, which were marketed for listening to music from the Egyptian majority, had an unused recording capability as well. They began to record their own songs, and this eventually led to the rise of a Bedouin pop star and the creation of new economic and cultural opportunities (Abu-Lughod 1989). Adaptation requires two technosocial features. First, an attribute of the technology-user relationship that Hess (1995) refers to as flexibility. For example, a calculator is less flexible than a word processor, which is less flexible than a personal computer. Second, it requires a violation of intended purpose. It is a mistake to reduce this to the intentions of designers; we also need to consider marketing intentions and common-sense or popular assumptions. In the case of Bedouin cassette players we have a pre-existing flexibility for recording that was intended by the designers, but this was obscured by the marketing focus on play-back only. Adaptation can be described as the discovery of a latent function, but that definition needs to be problemitized in the same ways that philosophers have debated whether mathematics is invention or discovery. The creativity required to look beyond the assumed functions of the technology and see new possibilities is a powerful force for social change, yet one that receives insufficient theoretical attention. \r\n\r\nThe strongest case for appropriated technology is \"reinvention,\" in which semantics, use and structure are all changed. That is, if adaptation can be said to require the discovery of a latent function, reinvention can be defined as the creation of new functions through structural change. Low-rider cars (see figure below) provide a clear demonstration of this combination. Although automobile shock absorbers were originally produced for decreasing disturbance, Latino mechanics developed methods for attaching them to electrically controlled air pumps, turning shock absorbers into shock producers (the cars can move vertically as well as horizontally). Low-rider cars violate both marketing and design intentions, but the new functionality was introduced by altering the original structure, rather than discovering functions lying dormant in the original artifact.  \r\n\r\nHaving studied appropriated technologies, what should we do with them?\r\n\r\nFirst, it is important to understand that in distinguishing strong versus weak cases for appropriated technology, we make no evaluation of ideology or effectiveness. One might, for instance, find more political success with reinterpretation than reinvention in a given case. It is, rather, more a question of how much involment the lay public can have in production versus consumption. \r\n\r\nSecond, appropriated technologies do not have an *inherent* ethical advantage. Not all forms of resistance are necessarily beneficial in the long run. Aihwa Ong, for example, notes that Malaysian women using spirit possession as resistance to exploitation may be releasing frustrations that could have gone into collective labor organizing. And as we noted, white supremacist groups might well be described as marginalized people who appropriate the internet and other technologies. While free speech must be preserved at all costs, appropriation is not making a better society in the case of neo-nazi web sites. \r\n\r\nThird, Insofar as science and technology appropriations do have potential contributions to stronger democracy (cf. Schuler 1996), we need to understand how these positive attributes can succeed. First, there are obstacles to appropriation on the design side; most obviously those created by totalitarian governments, but corporations can also dampen or discourage appropriation. The flexibility required to allow user adaptation, for example, is increasingly threatened in contemporary information technology marketing strategies. Encouraging designers to incorporate appropriation as a positive virtue means reversing this trend towards inflexibility. Second, there are obstacles to appropriation on the lay public side. We need to not only overcome the ideology barrier, but also the barriers of education and access to physical resources.', 'In terms of the designer barrier, we can train engineers and designers to think about approapriation as a positive goal. In terms of the ideology barrier, we can encourage marginalized groups to strive towards positive conceptions of hybridity rather than relying on notions of purity. And in terms of the resource barrier, we can encourage the creation of community technology centers, among other efforts. \r\n\r\nFinally, we should examine each case of lay/professional relationship in terms of the dependence or independence fostered by various appropriated technology strategies. A \"consumer ombudsman\" offers more independence than a marketing survey, participatory design offers more than the ombudsman, and appropriating technology offers a maximum of independance. But again this is not an ethical spectrum -- there are cases in which groups are better off with an ombudsman than an act of appropriation. Increasing independence can free up new possibilities, but decreasing it can facilitate institutionalization. Rather than romanticize independence, both users and designers should strive towards the lay/professional relationship that will move toward strong democracy in their particular context. In conclusion: we can encourage, inspire, and incite the use of appropriated technologies for opening new possibilities in the relations of culture and technoscience.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-07-28 12:39:14', '2007-03-18 15:42:15', NULL, NULL, 'rpi', NULL, 306, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

A thousand other struggles, against poverty, against oppression, against environmental degradation, retell the David and Goliath story with equally improbable outcomes. What\'s the secret to these unlikely successes?  Resources (including financial, organizational, cultural or many others) alone, though useful, don\'t tell the whole story: the group with the biggest war chest sometimes fails where the seemingly more impoverished group succeeds. Neither does the idea of \"political opportunity.\" And individual characteristics such as dedication, drive, emotional commitment &#150; although also quite important &#150; don\'t necessarily portend success or failure of activist struggles or social movements. There must be more to understanding why some efforts fail while others succeed beyond all expectations. Is \"you win a few, you lose a few\" the most useful conclusion we can draw?', 'Groups of people, whether formally organized or not, strive to make their positive impact on the world.  Any group devoted to social change must sustain their organization &#150; largely through marshalling and replenishing resources &#150; over the course  of its existence.  To achieve its goals, the members of a group must work effectively together to make decisions. This pattern is intended to help groups increase the probability that they\'ll make good decisions at each stage of the group\'s development and in its engagement with the rest of the world. According to Marshall Ganz, the person who developed the concept of this pattern,  it is most useful in \" turbulent environments where rules, resources, and interests are  emergent and links between ends and means are uncertain.\"', 'Discerning the macro tides of history is a risky business. Fortunately for those who undertake this avocation, those attempting the readings of the tea leaves writ large, have generally been quite dead years before the evidence emerges that demonstrates the unforeseen flaws in their reasoning. (Or, in rare cases, vindicates their astonishingly spot-on observations.)  Perhaps riskier is the business of responding purposefully, punctually, piercingly and resoundingly to the micro tides of the here and now; the unexpected opportunities that arise from nowhere and vanish as rapidly. The best responses often demonstrate a shocking disregard for conventional wisdom. They will often demonstrate a preternatural anticipation of the next event and the next even after that and so on &#150; while everyone else is seemingly caught unaware.\r\n\r\nIn the early 60\'s Marshall Ganz set aside his undergraduate studies at Harvard to work within the Civil Rights Movement in the US South. Twenty-eight years later, Ganz returned to Harvard, finished his Ba. and PhD., and developed the concept that this pattern is based on. \"Strategic Capacity\" specifically focuses on the question of <I>why</I> and <I>how</I> some people and organizations happen to adapt so wisely and, often, \"guilefully\", to new circumstances.  (Indeed, some appear to thrive on them!) Strategic Capacity is too elusive to yield to mechanical analytical probes.  For one thing, as Ganz points out, we can observe, \"choices about targeting, timing, and tactics\" (2004) but \"the strategy that frames these choices &#150; and provides them with their coherence &#150;  must often be inferred, using data drawn from interviews with participants, oral histories,  correspondence, memoirs, charters, constitutions, organizational journals, activity reports,  minutes of meetings, and participant observation.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that a specific strategy can probably be understood after the fact, the general strategic capacity of an organization\'s or movement\'s resistance to analysis is undoubtedly part of its power.  Thus Ganz focuses more on the conditions that engender successful strategizing within an individual or group (i.e. its \"strategic capacity\") than on the strategies themselves.  (Of course how a strategy is put into action is not trivial!) Ideally a group will  use its strategic capacity to simultaneously build its strength while accomplishing its objectives.\r\n\r\nGanz explains that decisions are expressions of strategy and that strategy is a type of <i>group</i> creative thinking or <I>distributed cognition</I> that is sometimes akin to the \"performance of a jazz ensemble.\"  His theory of Strategic Capacity uses <I>motivation,</i> <i>access to salient knowledge,</i> and the <I>heuristic processes</I> that organizational leaders use as the key factors behind effective strategic capacity. Motivation is important because it describes how willing the group is to work towards its goals and what types of goals are established in the first place. Ganz further states that motivation based on \"intrinsic rewards\" and on the moral meaning of the enterprise is very important. Access to salient knowledge is important because, without this knowledge &#150; particularly knowledge about \"resources and opportunities,\" the group would be using inadequate and misleading information that the group asses and interprets to make its decisions in the heuristic processes, the third constituent of strategic capacity.\r\n\r\nGanz then steps back to consider the two driving forces, <I>leadership</I> and <I>organization</I>, that will be employing the strategic capacity that the model describes.  According to Ganz, \"Leaders devise strategy in interaction with their environments.\" He stresses that leadership teams are more likely to have effective strategic capacity when they include \"insiders\" and \"outsiders\", have strong and weak \"ties\" (connections) to a variety of sociocultural networks, and have \"knowledge of diverse collective action repertoires.\" On the organization side, Ganz points out that, \"Leaders interact with their environment from within organizational structures.\" Leadership teams that are regularly involved in open deliberations with actionable outcomes have more strategic capacity, and leadership teams that rely more on people than money are cultivating sustainable strategic capacity by encouraging leaders who can effectively strategize.', 'A group or organization that makes good decisions will be more effective than one that doesn\'t. Marshall Ganz\'s concept of \"Strategic Capacity\" identifies the underlying attributes behind a group\'s ability to make these decisions. By improving these attributes, a group can likely improve its ability to make good &#150; and, sometimes, suprisingly good &#150; decisions. Based on Ganz\'s reading (2004) of Bruner (1990), \"Strategic thinking is reflexive and imaginative,  based on ways leaders learn to reflect on the past, attend to the present, and anticipate the future.\"', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-08-15 14:37:42', '2005-11-21 13:26:32', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The Labortech and Labor Media   conferences www.labortech2004.org  in many countries of the world have been important in training and building these international links.  They have taken place in Vancouver, BC, Moscow, Russia, Seoul, Korea and many cities in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the US and Europe and growing parts of Asia, these   resources are readily available  but at the same time workers in every country of the world must have the means and ability to concretely link up internationally. The developments of LaborNets in Japan, Korea, Austria, Germany, Turkey, Denmark and the US have been a growing vehicle for developing labor festivals and labor technology conferences.\r\n\r\nLaborFests or Labor Media Conferences have been held in Japan, Korea, the US, Russia. This past November, a LaborFest was held in Buenos Aries and one is planned this coming October in El Alto, Bolivia and in April-May 2006 in Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey.\r\n\r\nThese festivals which could be held in every city of the world provide a venue and concrete means for linking through film, music and culture the collective experiences and consciousness of workers throughout the world. The rebellions of workers in Latin America, the fight against capitalist globalization have been a theme that expose the commonality of all the attacks the working class faces.\r\n\r\nThe important need to use media both tv and radio to link workers around the world is also growing. The same economic policies such as deregulation, caualization, privatization and de-unionization are at work in every country of the world.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the workers in the United States to begin to challenge the basic assaults that they face is of course the responsibility of the corporate unionists who control the resources and apparatus of the trade unions. The failure to provide a concrete alternative program and agenda is a major impediment to any form of national and international fightback. The need for an international collaboration is also connected to develop the means for the international working class to take control of their destiny. Airline workers world wide, longshore workers, medical workers, teachers, public workers, telecommunication workers are faced with the exact same type of attacks yet they have been hobbled by a lack of international collaboration and collective joint action.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the Liverpool Dockers strike in 1995 that led to the formation of an international labor action in solidarity as well as a web based international solidarity campaign was crucial in building international support.\r\nhttp://www.labournet.net/sept97/sfpress1.html\r\n\r\nThis was carried on in 1997 when the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions KCTU and their supporters established an international web page in support of their general strike. The web page in Korean and English became a critical tool in building direct support action for workers around the world as well as an information portal on the struggle and a way for unions and workers worldwide to show their solidarity on the web.\r\n\r\nThe Korean union federation KCTU has been the most active national union federation in the world to seek collective cultural action and direct labor action to defend it\'s interests. It has recently called for a national strike against casualization and temporary work on November 23, 2005 and international action by workers throughout the world would be an important step in building this collective action about an issue that effects and harms working people worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe KCTU also hosts and organizes  a yearly festival in November 12 in commemoration of the death of labor organizer Chun Taeil to not only have a mass mobilization but a national 8 hour cultural media art celebration. This even which is held at the Korean Broadcasting Company Stadium brings together the experiences of the working class through a cultural and theatrical production that is choreographed to the minute over 8 hours. Such a festival could and should be held in every country that ties together the song, poetry, music and art of struggle. The power of this collective expression is an important element in breaking down the corporatized isolation, marginalization of workers and humanity as well as the commodification of music, art and cultural expressions for profit of the multi-nationals.\r\n\r\nThe growing privatization of the internet and the threat to censorship and control of the internet has been growing. In the Liverpool dockers strike, the shipping corporations tried to stop information from being posted. In Korea, the government sought to pressurize www.nodong.net, the Geman government this year raided the internet servers of the German labornet www.labournet.de. Most recently the Canadian Telus Corporation prevented million of users from accessing the labor web pages of the Canadian Telecom Union TWU.\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/01/business/worldbusiness/01telus.html?pagewanted=all\r\n\r\nThis censorship does not only come from corporate and anti-union media and technology corporations.\r\nIn the UK, the Executive Council of the FBU banned members from using the public website of an opposition grouping opposing labor management collaboration and \"partnerships\".\r\nhttp://www.labournet.net/sept97/sfpress1.html\r\n\r\n The international collective voices of working people have the power to overcome the different languages, cultures and borders that presently exist.

Modern environmental challenges are often difficult to see, distant in time and space from their sources, and threaten global consequences. The increasing complexity and chronic rather than acute nature of today\'s environmental problems requires a revolution of decisionmaking  the systematic integration of earths vital signs.', 'Signals detected by scientists about earth\'s natural patterns and processes and the impacts of humans on these processes are earth\'s signs - indicators of what can be seen as either ecological health or the capacity of the earth to accommodate human demands. The conditions of earth\'s systems tend to be worsening on a global scale, but vary dramatically from place to place. Human decisions about how to live on earth drive these trends and can potentially reverse their negative directions.\r\n\r\nPolicymakers, public interest organizations, universities, and governments can utilize earth\'s signs to better manage human and environmental well-being. Policymakers\' decisions about sustainable practices in land- and resource-dependent sectors can be backed by scientific understanding about the effects of policies on resources. Citizens can demand better environmental stewardship from their leaders at local to global scales with improved access to and translation of relevant earth information at the proper scale. Governments and enforcement bodies can strengthen their monitoring capabilities and base development decisions on the latest information about trends in human impacts on earth.', 'Three distinct approaches to integrating earth\'s vital signs come from the scientific community, public interest organizations, and enforcement bodies.\r\n\r\nScientific institutions can collaborate to reach audiences in need of earth-related information to solve problems. The work of earth observation agencies to collect and disseminate data and images to important users like humanitarian aid agencies provides one example. Disaster prevention, response, and rebuilding are information-intensive. This fact is illustrated time and time again in the wake of natural disasters. For example, in Asia in 2005, an immediate need emerged in tsunami-affected areas for earth observation and environmental data to help in assessing damage, reaching victims and rebuilding resilient communities. In response to this need, an alliance of European and International organizations is working with the humanitarian community to improve access to maps, satellite imagery and geographic information (The CGIAR-CSI Data Sharing Platform). This kind of effort by the scientific community to ensure that information actually comes back \'down to earth\' opens a host of possibilities for more sustainable decisionmaking if scientists in other fields can repeat it. Scientists from communities researching water, pollution and future risks from global warming could create similar initiatives to ensure the information that they gather becomes integrated in decisionmaking in water-scarce areas, in clean water and air policies, and for promoting climate change adaptation in development strategies, to name a few.\r\n\r\nAnother way earths signs are integrated into decisionmaking is by concerned public interest groups and universities gathering, translating and communicating trends that reflect environmental sustainability to motivate improved environmental governance. The outcomes of resource and land management policies such as energy, fisheries, forests, water, urban planning and rural development can be extrapolated from existing environmental data. A key challenge however, is translating scientific information to connect to the public and policymakers. In examples from around the world, organizations locate data reflecting the condition of impacted resources, create indicators of stewardship or sustainability from these data, and translate their findings into insightful measurements, models and maps that are publicly available and understandable to broader audiences. Clarifying the connections between political and business decisions and environmental outcomes can promote environmentally sustainable decisions and reverse negative trends if decisionmakers are held accountable to these indicators. Scorecards of environmental performance (Environmental Performance Index), policy-wise ecological assessments (Hudson River Foundation), and regional indicators and indices of sustainability (Cascadia Scorecard) have the potential to become a systematic part of policymaking if leaders are held accountable for their performance on these measures of earth\'s vital signs. Currently, information is not available at the right scales and frequently enough for such assessments to be carried in every context, but an increase in reporting has been proven to stimulate better information gathering.\r\n\r\nEarth monitoring information has also been used by enforcement agencies, environmental organizations, and governments to improve accountability for the environmental impacts of business practices. Satellite imagery and other sources of management practices can be used to monitor natural resources on public lands, in protected areas, human settlements, etc. One example comes from an initiative in Central Africas Congo Basin, an important wood products exporting region to Europe (Global Forest Watch). European procurement standards are the highest in the world, and buyers often demand legally and sustainably harvested wood from their suppliers. A system to monitor the legality and sustainability of forestry operations has emerged that utilizes satellite imagery, tracking whether harvested areas conform to legally-agreed boundaries and harvest rates. By making the findings publicly accessible, consumers use the information in procurement decisions and market pressure can promote better management by companies. Similar innovative applications of earth information can capitalize on market forces and encourage sustainable resource management if public concern is tangible.', 'Integrating earth\'s signs throughout decisionmaking requires that environmental information is widely available, connections between management practices and environmental outcomes are understood, environmental implications of policies are translated to the public and policymakers, and that the environmental performance of governments and companies is publicly disseminated. Replication of existing initiatives and further innovations can help to ensure that decisionmaking balances human impacts with the health of the planet.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-09-11 21:22:12', '2007-07-19 11:54:39', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 315, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(633, 613, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'In what terms can we describe the social architecture that sets the context in which participation and power shape social activity? We need an approach that works in all kinds of societies to identify basic units of social action in the way that cells are basic elements of living organisms or rooms are basic parts of buildings. The approach needs to fit well with the idea of pattern language.', 'In order to locate the sites of citizen participation and the barriers to collective action, an inclusive map of social action is essential. There are many social sites where people exercise the power of participation. The multiplication and enlargement of businesses, the spread of non-governmental organizations, and the rise and ebb of social movements all underline the need to look broadly and beyond government for a way to describe the architecture of social action.', 'The approach holds that activity settings are foci of social energy; they contain and organize social forces that impel action just as surely as individual needs, desires, and strategies do.  It was pioneered by ecological psychologists looking for a way to describe and compare differing and changing contexts of human behavior. It has wide application for understanding how collective activity is structured, how it is stabilized or altered, and how it shapes and is shaped by individual intentions and experience.  One important recent innovation is the invention and multiplication of virtual activity settings like internet chat rooms that have some of the features of physically situated activity settings. \r\n\r\nAll action by all people takes place in one or another activity setting. Activity settings  form the immediate environment of individuals. They limit and create opportunities for action and experience.  They are the contexts of choice and of the realization of individual and group projects. From the standpoint of the pattern language project those settings are most interesting in which people discuss, plan, and take action that brings about social change.\r\n\r\nAt the core of each setting is the program of the setting, a body of knowledge and instruction  that gives direction about what activities should be undertaken and how to carry them out.  Usually the program is found in the minds of participants, especially leaders, in the setting; sometimes a written constitution or a rule book gives it formal expression.  Preserving and transmitting knowledge of the program is crucial for maintaining the setting.  In some settings the program of activity is determined locally, in the setting itself or in a nearby setting.  But often settings are arranged in hierarchies of power in which the controlling setting is remote.\r\n\r\nTime-space units are familiar in social analysis and everyday language. On a very large scale historians discover distinct epochs, eras, and episodes which divide the flow of historical time into units with some homogeneity and logical integrity.  Modern Europe, classical Greece, frontier America, Mogul India are social-historical entities recognized by historians whose interpretive strategies may differ in important ways.  Social geographers find large geo-social units where human settlement and transportation patterns have received an impress which marks them off from neighboring regions:  the Andean highlands, the great plains of North America, the Maghreb, the Ganges basin.  On a much smaller scale journalists trained to flag the where and the when of the news, report the meeting of the Security Council on February 12, last Wednesdays press conference by the Prime Minister in Ottawa, or the robbery Sunday night at Hugos Convienience Store.  And ordinary people record in their calendars commitments like Julia Roberts film at the Century Cinema and dinner 7 pm with Alex at Bens Smoked Meat Restaurant.  In all these cases there is a perception of an activity unit bounded or unified by the nature of the activity itself. \r\n \r\nTo see the world of human action in terms of activity settings is to see units of the following kinds: trafficways (people and vehicles in roads and streets moving about, talking, and looking around); retail shops (customers entering shops, looking around, choosing objects, exchanging words with a proprietor or employee, giving of money, getting of object, exiting shop); meetings (people sitting in a room facing a table with several people behind it, chair presents agenda, participants discuss items and make motions, chair calls for vote).  Many activity settings repeat themselves at regular intervals and become well-known features of the social landscape; they may even be marked on maps and catalogued in the pages of the telephone book.  All are specific entities with a unique address in time and space; most have a name familiar to their participants.  \r\n\r\nActivity settings are especially useful intermediate units for relating to the experience of individual persons on one side and to social organizations and structures on the other side.  Persons are essential parts of activity settings: no people, no setting.  But few settings are dependent upon any particular person for their existence.  From the standpoint of the setting, people are among its components.  In fact activity settings can be seen as fields of social forces which attract some people to them and repel others and which steer or regulate the activity of their participants within rather narrow limits.  Individuals experience the different fields of social forces as they move in the course of their day from one activity setting to another. \r\n\r\nThey are also often organized into hierarchies in which executive settings control, or attempt to control, activity in subordinate settings. Power over individuals  and the participatory powers of individuals are invariable mediated by activity settings with patterns and programs of action that can be observed and mapped. They can also be created, changed, and destroyed.\r\n\r\n R.D. Laing notes that each setting\r\n\r\n\"requires a more or less radical transformation of the persons who comprise it.  Consider the metamorphoses that one man must go through in one day as he moves from one form of sociality to another -- family man, speck of crowd dust, functionary in the organization, friend. These are not simply different roles; each is a whole past and present and future, offering different options and constraints, different degrees of change or inertia, different kinds of closeness and distance, different sets of rights and obligations, different pledges and promises. \"  \r\n\r\nThe interplay between individual motives and situational forces is a fundamental theme in the politics of political settings.  You may have had occasion personally to experience the powerful pull of a large political demonstration, or felt the revulsion mixed with fear inspired by a rally of a movement you believed to be dangerous.  We have all been driven against some part of our will to attend a gathering we wanted to avoid.  And many of us have brought social pressures to bear on other people to attend a meeting that we believed merited attendance.  Such experiences constitute introspective evidence for the existence of social forces attracting or repelling participation in activity settings.  \r\n\r\n For a fuller discussion see the entry for Political Space.', 'The settings approach focuses on the most basic unit of collective action: activity setting. It is a pattern of peoples activity in a particular place and time together with the objects and environmental features to which the activity is coordinated. Most settings have clear space/time boundaries and names that are well-known to the people familiar with them. Many activity settings -- shops, offices, school classes, and legislative sessions are examples -- occur at regular times.  Others, like political demonstrations, occur irregularly.  All have characteristic programs of action that may include elements of the pattern language of social activism.

Although \"legitimate\" or mainstream theater has traditionally been a gathering place for the exchange of ideas, it is largely irrelevant in today\'s world as a tool for social change.  Forces which have contributed to this situation include economic factors, dwindling audiences, the talent drain to other mediums, the transformation of audience tastes and expectations as a result of film and television, and the decline of the avant-garde as alternative to legitimate theatre.', 'Illegitimate Theater can be \"legimitate\" response in almost any setting of ordinary &mdash; and extraordinary &mdash; life.  It can be practiced in any place where an \"audience\" might be found.', '\"Legitimate theater\" engages a paying audience sitting inside a theater with the expectation that they will watch the performance of a play or musical. These productions employ conventions normally associated with traditional theater: lights up and down, applause at the end of acts, a proscenium stage, professional actors working with prepared scripts, no significant interaction between performers and spectators.  \r\n\r\nWhile legitimate theater has lost much of its relevance to our everyday lives, theater (or <I>performance</I>) in the broad sense is a fundamental human experience. As such it represents a reservoir of immense potential that a mediated experience can rarely provide: the potential for human interaction.  Film and video provide a stream of images to watch, but no experiences in which the viewer can actually participate. Everyday life is often a sequence of ordinary, that is expected, events. One\'s life experiences easily become insulated from important world events &mdash; and the possibility of learning from new experiences as well. Ordinariness becomes a form of oppression and a steady dumbing down of society is deleterious to culture and to democracy as well. Performance provides an immediate human experience. Theater &mdash; particularly its \"illegitimate\" varieties &mdash; can also punctuate the ordinary and thrust new and unexpected experiences into everyday life. It has the power to bring a person into new, temporary realities in which the self is momentarily forgotten and submerged. Theater can empower the spectator with insight and possibilities. \r\n\r\nBaz Kershaw in his insightful study of the British <i>Alternative Theatre Movement</i> over four decades explicitly addresses the role of theater as an instrument of \"cultural intervention.\" His book (1992) \"is about the ways in which theater practitioners have tried to change not just the future action of their audiences, but also the structure of the audience\'s community and the nature of the audience\'s culture.\" This pattern affirms Kershaw\'s observation: New theater should accompany a new society. \r\n\r\nOther phrases &mdash such as Theater Without Theater, Anti-Theater, Meta-Theater, The World\'s a Stage, Social Performance, Guerilla Theater, or Oppositional (or Radical or Provocative) Theater &mdash are variations on the title of this pattern. Each of these alternative formulations focuses on some attributes and not on others. We use the term \"Illegitimate Theater\" primarily to highlight the differences between it and <I>legitimate</I> theater. Illegitimate theater can describe any performances in which one or more conventions of the legitimate theater are circumvented. For example, the convention of a single, discrete performance can be ignored in illegitimate theater. Thus, a \"one-two punch\" can be delivered, possibly anonymously: Half of the cast can \"perform\" &mdash; in Starbucks, at the zoo, or, even, a traditional theatrical venue &mdash; while the other half of the cast can \"accidentally\" encounter the audience afterwards and engage with them a second time, perhaps in dialogue, perhaps again as spectators, perhaps as actor / participants in a new performance that builds on ideas of the original one. The French group Le Grand Magic Circus devised a performance which gradually added the spectators (while withdrawing their members) at the \"end\"  of their performance until finally the spectators were the only ones left \"performing\" (Bennett,  1990).\r\n\r\nPerformance is an extremely broad term that characterizes an infinite number of situations including sports, rituals, education, carnivals, politics and protest.  It can encompass everyday social events such as shopping, eating in restaurants, going to parties or hanging out. Performance can be spontaneous or planned, obviously \"staged\" or masquerading as \"real life,\" artistic, political, cultural. The advent of performance studies as an academic discipline which transcends the traditional notion of <i>the</i> theater has contributed to our understanding of these myriad forms. \r\n\r\nBertolt Brecht, the most influential artist/advocate of theater for social change, rejected Aristotelian drama (the basis of Legitimate Theater) in favor of the Epic or Dialectical Theater. His theories and plays, such as <i>Three Penny Opera\"</i> and <i>Mother Courage</i>, blur the line between real life and performance, reveal the mechanics of production, present actor and character simultaneously, and employ a wide range of techniques designed to rouse the audience to social action. The venerable San Francisco Mime Troupe with performances such as <i>Fact Wino vs. Armagoddonman,</i> <i>Damaged Care,</i> and <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Obscuristan</i>, is a more recent incarnation of Brechtian rebellion. Augusto Boal from Brazil, a Workers\' Party (PT) activist, pioneered \"Theater of the Oppressed\" and other forms of participatory role-playing theater that has helped audiences to explore and recognize their own predicaments while fostering cooperation and critical engagement. \r\n\r\nMany public protests, especially those that include role playing, dramatic encounters, or masks, puppets and other props can be viewed as a type of performance. When Greenpeace\'s sailing ship \"Rainbow Warrior\" confronts a nuclear submarine or whaling ship, two symbolic worlds collide. Crosses symbolizing those killed in Iraq spring up in Crawford, Texas near the ranch of U.S. President George Bush; Argentine mothers and grandmothers clothed in mourning black stand before the president\'s Casa Rosa in Buenos Aires. More recently social activists employing techniques of <i>illegitimate</i> theater, have emerged to confront corporate globalization. These include the marching bands and giant puppets in the 1999 protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle, Reverend Billy from the Church of Stop Shopping who orchestrates chain store \"interventions\" to \"unlock the hypnotic power of transnational capital\" and the \"Yes Men\" who have \"played the roles\" (as they satirically interpreted them) of various corporate and organizational officials to unsuspecting audiences around the world. \r\n\r\nAs Erving Goffman would say &mdash; and Shakespeare before him &mdash; the world is truly a stage and everything we do in public is a type of performance. This of course means in a trivial sense that everyday life provides a venue for exhibition and self-promotion. The media exploits people\'s desire for \"fame\" (or publicity &mdash; the desire to be made publicly recognizable) and exhibits the ones it considers off-beat enough for public display, in the modern day equivalent of a freak show. \r\n\r\nMedia is more easily commodified when it assumes rigid forms. When a \"package\" exists, it\'s relatively easy &mdash; and cost-effective &mdash; to replicate it again and again with little effort or creativity. And when commercial broadcast media defines what is \"legitimate\", the imagination of the people decays, their capacity to create is harder to draw upon, their tolerance for experimentation and \"amateurism\" diminishes. \r\n\r\nIllegitimate Theater, like other patterns in this language, has unsavory manifestations as well: burning a cross in the yard of an African-American or other ethnic minority, militaristic parades and rallies, public intimidates.  Since \"performance\" likely predates language, its effects on people can be deep; it can unlock hate as well as love, anger as well as reason and compassion. Theater, whether legitimate or not, can be driven by emotion and therefore less analytic than many other patterns in this language. \r\n\r\nIllegitimate Theater blurs or even negates the line between spectators and performers. In its extreme version everybody, all the time, is an <i>actor.</i> And \"actors\" in public performances can also be \"actors\" in social life, actors who help make things happen &mdash; for good or for ill. Although our life \"in public\" is a series of performances, our roles are often construed as \"bit parts.\" But every moment is a \"teachable moment;\" every public appearance is an opportunity to do something new and to experience something new. Thus anybody, at least in theory, can practice the craft of illegitimate theater. The \"performances\" that come from this practice can be simple or elaborate, impromptu or painstakingly rehearsed. The point is to cause ripples in the everyday stream of life. \r\n\r\nIllegitimate theater, like is predecessors \"legitimate\" or otherwise, can be used to provoke emotional reactions, discussion or reflection. Practiced successfully and in a great number of venues, illegitimate theater could help foster positive social change and increased democratization of culture.', 'Illegitimate theater represents a intriguing set of possibilities for interactions between people that can  lead to social change. Performance as a deeply human phenomenon can be explored by audience and performers alike in our quest for a better world.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-09-18 19:39:41', '2008-02-23 11:58:04', 'Public Sphere Project', NULL, 'The Evergreen State College', NULL, 323, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Technical, social and management issues are frequently involved, but the complex, inter-connected mix of factors at work is often confusing. There isnt a common language for understanding and modelling a particular organisations situation. Furthermore, until understanding is achieved, action-planning and change is even more problematic. However, ideas of sustainability drawn from the worlds of sustainable development, sustainable communities and environmentalism are familiar to many civil society activists and non-profits. Can these ideas be imported to form a holistic sense-making framework for understanding non-profit ICT use? More important, can the use of sustainability indicators also help inform action-planning and change, on the basis that diagnosis is half way towards a cure?', 'This pattern has emerged from extensive research, development and consulting on ICT in non-profit organisations (Plant, 2003). Non-profit organisations are key to organised social action and increasingly reliant on ICT in pursuing their missions, especially as they move from internal, efficiency-oriented, applications to those that support service delivery externally. But small non-profits are frequently vulnerable to, yet dependent upon, external expertise due to limited internal knowledge. Outside support is, furthermore, often technically-biased and solutions-focused. There is a need to facilitate internal capacity development and learning, especially on the organisational and political, not just technical, factors associated with ICT. The notion of sustainability as imported into this field embraces a holistic range of organisational, social and technical factors. These affect success and autonomy in the use of ICT, as well as technological longevity. The application of sustainability indicators to appraise ICT use in non-profits should interest both non-profit staff and outside helpers committed to a facilitative approach. Those needing a holistic understanding of a particular organisational situation, and those looking to move towards action-planning for change and improvement in ICT use, should benefit.', 'A sustainability model was originally constructed, as an analytic abstraction for research purposes, to model the suggestion that three main factors, each with sub-factors, might explain sustainability or its absence in non-profit ICT. \r\nThe top-level factors were inspired by the triple bottom line in sustainable development (Henriques & Richardson, 2004) combined with information systems theory. They are associated with longevity (technical factors which affect IT quality and life expectancy), success (management factors which affect the overall impact of ICT use on the organisation) and autonomy (empowerment factors which affect the extent of appropriate relationships with outside expertise). A three-segment graphical representation was created to summarise and integrate these factors visually.\r\n\r\nA method of appraising sustainability operationally in any given non-profit was derived from the theoretical model. A questionnaire asks respondents to agree or disagree with assertions associated with sustainability in each of the three main areas, using a five-point Likert scale. Drawing on Bell and Morse\'s (1999; 2003) approach to sustainability indicators, these qualitative responses are plotted on a three-segment diagram similar to the theoretical model. This results in a visual impression of sustainability, as subjectively interpreted by the organisational stakeholder(s) taking part.\r\n\r\nA full \"Information Systems Healthcheck\" service was then designed (Plant, 2001). The consultant first gathers and preliminarily analyses sustainability appraisal data from completed questionnaires. A face-to-face meeting then takes place, at which feedback is offered, and the situational diagnosis is discussed with client representative(s). The consultation then moves towards initial action planning and change. Possible areas for improvement are drawn directly from the graphical sustainability appraisal \"plot\" and respondents annotations.\r\n\r\nSpecific action-plans that might bring about change and improvement are identified, focusing on segments where sustainability appears to be weakest. The follow-up to this part of the process involves a wider cross-section of the client organisation\'s staff being canvassed if possible in order to confirm, enrich or challenge the situational diagnosis and the action-planning steps emerging.\r\n\r\nEvaluation of the healthcheck service suggests that it leads to new insight for client organisations. Key phrases appearing on evaluation questionnaires emphasise the strengths of a completely outside perspective that forces the issue to give participants an understanding of context and make recommendations from an unbiased viewpoint following critical review.\r\n\r\nInsight appeared to be based largely on bringing to the surface ideas that were already latent within the organisation, newly articulated and legitimised as a result of the engagement. It was therefore argued that internal capacity can be unlocked by employing the external facilitator in the role of a sounding board. Drawing out multiple perspectives through this participative approach appeared particularly important.\r\n\r\nThe crucial requirement for the client to take ownership of the process cannot yet be taken for granted. For this reason and others, further action research is needed to confirm or challenge the findings. Follow-up work is time-consuming and demanding for clients, particularly if, as suggested during the healthcheck, the consultants definitions of health and sustainability are to be challenged, reviewed and appropriated to suit local conditions and culture. \r\n\r\nThe qualitative basis of this work also leads to its own challenges. The most effective sustainability appraisals have been those involving questionnaire responses from multiple stakeholders that express divergent views. Productive outcomes have resulted from the debate and discussion over the multiple subjective interpretations of sustainability that have emerged. Focusing on disagreement as well as agreement can of course generate conflict instead of consensus, so requires sensitive facilitation and careful management. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, given that as follow-up clients are encouraged to engage organisational stakeholders at all levels (a move that could generally be considered healthy), such conflict can be problematic for those in less powerful positions. More generally, the process may influence the existing power balance; this could either be positive or negative in any given organisation. As a minimum, this possibility must be taken into account.', 'Sustainability ideas were originally imported into the non-profit ICT field in order to construct an explanatory model for research purposes, but their utility goes beyond this. The use of sustainability indicators has led to a practical grounded tool for understanding real-world non-profit ICT situations. \r\n\r\nA common language for making sense of and modelling the organisational, social and technical factors involved in ICT sustainability in individual non-profits is now available. \r\n\r\nBut it has not only been used successfully to achieve situation diagnosis and understanding, it has also led non-profits towards practical action for change and improvement in ICT use. Although there is more work to be done, the core method, an \"information systems healthcheck\", involves a visual representation of sustainability that promotes accessibility, and a facilitative approach that can lead to empowerment and organisational learning. Furthermore, researchers concerned with industrial or other sectors have observed similarities with ideas such as capability maturity modelling, and this work may well have application beyond the non-profit sector.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-09-19 06:50:47', '2007-03-18 17:35:15', NULL, NULL, 'University of the West of England, Bristol', NULL, 322, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Simulations can help illuminate these consequences (for example, a simulation of the long-term effects on land use, transportation, and environmental impacts of different choices).  To be compelling and useful, the simulation results should presented in a way that they can be understood and used by a range of interested citizens.  Further, ideally not just the results, but access to running the simulation, should be available to the public, to allow experimentation with alternatives.  To aid in understanding and credibility, the simulation should be constructed in a transparent fashion, so that its operation is open to inspection and discussion.', 'This pattern is potentially useful to advocacy groups, other community organizations, business associations, and local and regional governments.  Using this pattern depends on a suitable simulation and data being available.  Another factor (less important but useful) would be the existence of a community indicators program that tracks current trends using indicators, so that the *same* indicators can be used to both track current trends and to present the simulation results.  (Doing this is particularly useful in applying the Reality Check pattern [link to Reality Check pattern], in which simulation results are compared with observed, real-world data.', 'Community Indicators [link to Community and Civic Indicators pattern] can provide an important tool for monitoring current trends in a community.  However, we will usually be interested in the values of these indicators in the future, not just the present - and which actions will result in more desirable outcomes as measured by the community indicators.  Simulation and modeling can provide a powerful tool for informing such discussions, particularly if the results from the simulation can be presented using the same indicators as selected in a participatory Community and Civic Indicators project.  For example, the summary graphic for this pattern shows the population densities in the Puget Sound region in Washington State in 2025 given the current land use and transportation plans, as projected by the UrbanSim simulation system.\r\n\r\nThe results of the work should be made available using the web or printed reports.  Using the web has the advantage that definitions of indicators, documentation, and related information can be conveniently linked together.\r\n\r\nSupporting public access to running the simulation, as well as the results, might be provided in several different ways, depending on the complexity and size of the simulation and input data.  Particularly for complex simulations, with substantial data requirements, accessing a simulation hosted on a server via a web interface is a good technique.  Smaller simulations might be downloaded and run on individual\'s computers.\r\n\r\nThis is in general not an easy pattern to use.  In addition to developing the set of indicators (including careful definitions and documentation), a simulation of the phenomenon of interest must exist or be developed, including the necessary data and calibration to apply it in the given community.  For the example used here (land use and transportation), this typically requires that the local or regional government agency in charge of land use and transportation planning either undertake the simulation work itself, or be willing to work closely with another organization that does so.\r\n\r\nThe game SimCity demonstrates that many people -- including grade school children -- can be highly engaged by what might have been thought to be a dry topic, namely urban planning.  While games such as SimCity can provide valuable inspiration and interaction ideas, there are key differences between such games and the simulations suggested in this pattern.  First, this pattern is concerned with producing simulations of actual phenomena, for example, simulating a specific, real, urban area, with the intent of producing useful forecasts of its long-term development to inform public deliberation and debate.  Second, the interaction techniques available to its users should expose only the actions and \"policy levers\" available to real citizens and governments (for the urban simulation example, such as building light rail systems or changing zoning).  Users of these simulations can\'t simply declare that an area will be redeveloped (or bring in Godzilla); rather, all they can do is change relevant policies in a scenario in hopes of influencing people in the simulated environment to redevelop the area and residents to move there.\r\n\r\nPotential challenges to the result include challenges to the accuracy and reliability of the simulation.', 'Develop a simulation of the system of interest (for example, of urban land use and transportation), and make the results of the simulation accessible to interested stakeholders using indicators.

It is created in limited supply by central authority so it can stand as something of value in itself. Hence, normal money can go anywhere, which is an asset in some functions and a liability in others.\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem : conventional money is dysfunctional\r\n\r\nIt\'s a matter of design, but not deliberate design. \"Money\" became a commodity itself, and therefore limited in supply. This evolutionary process has left us using a money that is better as a store of value than as a means of exchange.\r\n\r\nThe origins of this problem lie in fear and greed - nobody parts with anything of value without confidence that they\'re getting value in return. So money has generally had to be a thing of value in itself to be acceptable in trade.\r\n\r\nThe need for a universal medium with assured value necessitated the limited issue by authority who \"stood\" behind the money, or backed it with gold or something similar. But this function of money as a store of value, and therefore scarce, entirely compromises its function as a means of exchange.\r\n\r\nSo when there is work to be done such as building homes or looking after children, all too often the money (the measure) is missing. People with the necessary skills to build homes and care for children remain unemployed. The money\'s just not there when it\'s needed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, conventional money fails to service the economy effectively - it leaves pockets and sectors of deprivation. This is an inevitable consequence of a money that exists in limited quantity. Its distribution will pattern the Pareto effect - a few will have a lot and many will have little.\r\n\r\nOur dependance on normal money generates patterns of competition, exploitation, hoarding and crime, as we are reduced to competition for survival in a truly plentiful world. And for the physical ecology on which we are totally dependent, normal money is a disastrous problem - forests are strip mined; air, water and food are poisoned; estuaries are paved; and climate is changed globally - just to make a buck.\r\n\r\nIt all comes down to money in the end. The problems of the world come from our actions, and our actions, both as a society and as individuals, are largely determined by the way money works. Many trivial and even damaging things are being done simply because some people have the money and the will to do them. In contrast, other things of real value, many essential to the survival of the planet, are not happening simply because those who have the will, don\'t have the money. People are working in ways detrimental to their personal health, to that of the environment, both locally and globally, and to the well-being of their community because they need the money.\r\n\r\nFor most of the planet, the money comes first - what we do to get it comes second. And this is so because money is our means of exchange - we need to earn it to keep in the game. This is a problem, since money is scarce and essentially difficult to come by.\r\n\r\nConsider the extent to which the economy of your own community is distorted at present by its need to import money through the export of real resources, often at unrealistic prices. Communities will squander resources, pander to tourists, entice heavy industry, and accept questionable benefits from government programs simply to keep the wages rolling. And consider how your community exports money to bring in goods and services at the most \"economical\" prices, rendering local producers idle, at an incalculable cost to the infrastructure of the community.\r\n\r\nMost regions are communities in name rather than reality. An effective community is a process, an ongoing collection of social patterns and continuing relationships. It used to be that towns, villages, and regions were much more self reliant than now. When transportation was slow and expensive, when much had to be produced locally as it was too perishable to travel, when moving money was itself a risky business, most of the productive work in a community was addressed to meeting its own needs with what was available locally. With the advent of \"cheap\" energy and transportation, technologies of preservation, and the present ease of global monetary transactions, communities everywhere have been progressively drawn into patterns of cash crop specialization and the inevitable dependency relationship.\r\n\r\nThe flight of money from a community can leave it devoid of the means to trade within itself, even when resources are available. People are unemployed, not because they lack skills or they are unwilling to work, but simply because the money to employ them has drained away from the part of the world where they live.', 'Context - money is information\r\n\r\nMoney isn\'t really real - it\'s a social artifact, a ticketing system we use to manage who gets what and how much of it. So it\'s absurd that there are economies inactive merely for lack of tickets, when tickets can be created as required.\r\n\r\nIt\'s been a long time since the country\'s money was anything of \"real\" value - gold, silver or something else precious in itself. Nowadays, money is just a ticket system - cheap metal coins, paper bills and cheques, or just records in some bank computer. Money has become a form of social information, something of absolutely no value in itself that we use to measure how we value other things, including our time.\r\n\r\nNO INCHES TODAY?\r\n\r\nIt\'s understandable that there should be shortages of real things, like bricks, fuel, skilled labour, or food, but why should we ever be short of measurements, short of gallons, degrees or pounds? Why should the economy fall into recession and people be unemployed, merely from a lack of money, when money is nothing but tickets and measures? That would be like having everything needed to build a house - but not building because we ran out of inches. \"We have plenty of wood, but sorry, we have no inches today.\" Obviously, this is nonsense.\r\n\r\nMoney is just information and we can create our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefining mutual credit money - aka community (complementary) currencies (cc)\r\n\r\nAccounts in a mutual credit system (community currency) start at 0 and fluctuate between debits and credits. The community currency (cc) is originally created by the buyer making a payment to the seller - the buyer\'s account goes negative and the seller\'s account positive. These are reputation based currencies - for your money to be accepted in payment in due course you have to reciprocate by earning them. Your money is your word - how good is your money?\r\n\r\nThese moneys, created as needed, circulate in the communities they serve. They are convivial in form and function - what goes around comes around.', 'Patterns of distribution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe typical patterns of distribution emerging in a money simulation game - LETSplay (http://openmoney.org/letsplay) - show the difference between a commodity money (every player starts with $200) and a community currency where all start at zero and the money in circulation is not fixed. The y-axis tracks total trading and the x-axis shows balance (positive to the left, negative to the right).\r\n\r\nThe patterns of distribution displayed here are not a consequence of how people play the game, but of how the two different forms of money distribute.\r\n\r\nIn the limited supply money, players soon diverge from their starting holding of $200, but while no-one can diverge down by more than $200 to zero, there isn\'t an upper limit and every player with high holdings means several with less than $200, and often with little or nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the mutual credit money(cc), players hoarding the money have no effect on others, nor do they gain any advantage or power over others. Similarly, although it may seem to defy common sense, excessive spenders have little impact on the viability of the system, and indeed are far more rare than generally supposed - the \"free-rider\" problem is discovered to be more imaginary than real.\r\n\r\nIn the real world, the difference between these distribution patterns and the power relations they create - power over / power with - can generate significantly different behaviours in users. Typically, people (and business) are more generous in their dealings with cc than they are with hard money. This is a micro-economic effect, working at the level of the individual user acting in their own perceived best interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatterns of connection\r\n\r\nThere are very important macro-economic consequences to the use of closed loop money, that are best understood from the recognition that the patterns possible for the movement of the money itself determine the patterns of goods and services exchanged. We are familiar with the idea that money makes the world go round, but less aware how this happens.\r\n\r\nIn those sectors of the economy where transactions are monetised, there are two components to the event. A gives B something \"real\" - goods or services; B gives A something \"unreal\" - money. Since no money means no deal, the patterns in which a money can or cannot move determine the patterns of exchange of goods and services the money can or cannot support. The patterns of money and the goods it moves are identical in form and the inverse of each other.\r\n\r\nConventional money can move anywhere, and so it does - moving in and out of any community in response to the sum of market forces, and thus making the community dependent on imports and exports.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, community currencies circulate within the community. They can only move from user to user, thereby applying internal resources to internal needs.\r\n\r\nConsider the multiplier effect of a money that continues to circulate - creating real common wealth.', 'Solution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way conventional money works is a problem for many people and their communities all over the world.

Yet all of these are needed for mutual decisions towards a healthy, just and sustainable future (Brown 2006).\r\n\r\nEach knowledge culture was found to reject the contributions of the others.  Individual knowledge is dismissed as anecdote, community knowledge as gossip, specialist knowledge as jargon, organisational knowledge as plotting, and holistic knowledge as airy-fairy. Yet all five knowledge cultures have to learn to accept each other\'s contribution if there is to be a constructive synthesis. A sustainable synthesis calls for commitment to respecting their individual contributions while strengthening their connections. This represents a fundamental change in the way we think. \r\n\r\nTools found to assist in this transformational change include David Bohm\'s Rules of Dialogue, namely, maintain open communication, suspend judgment, separate inquiry and advocacy, clarify assumptions, listen to yourself, and remain open to the unexpected Bohm 1996). Concerted change requires all the knowledge cultures to join in the stages of open learning, as described by David Kolb: developing principles, defining parameters, designing for potential and doing and reviewing the new practice (Keen, Brown, and Dyball 2005).    \r\n\r\nThese suggested strategies for collective thinking were tested in three sites: an isolated desert town wanting a green town park, a tightly-packed beach-side suburb needing to control oceans of tourist waste, and an Indigenous community wishing to become self-supporting.  Three years later, all had achieved their goals and established pathways for collective thinking.', 'Collective decision-making towards a humane sustainable future requires the following:\r\n1.    Commitment to synthesis: Individuals, community, specialists, and organisations reach a shared understanding on .\r\n2.    Collective learning: The knowledge cultures learn from one another, following the stages of Kolb\'s open learning cycle, .\r\n3.

People can become discouraged in their work toward some common good. They suffer a dissonance between, on one hand, their enthusiasm for an uplifting cause and, on the other, the gritty reality of bringing it about. What seems at the outset to be a life-enhancing enterprise can produce frustration, burnout and turnover of group members.', 'To pursue a shared goal is to seek a positive impact on the world: what David Cooperrider (1990) describes as a heliotropic movement, toward the light of a positive image of the future. As long as the group visualizes the positive contribution that its work will make, it will approach its work with optimism and hope. If pursuing the goal appears as the remediation of a deficit rather than movement toward a positive image, over time a focus on the negative will emerge.', 'Conflict can affect a group of people positively or negatively; it can be functional or dysfunctional. Some level of conflict can lead to creativity, responsiveness to change, and learning from experience. Conflict becomes dysfunctional when it produces feelings of hostility, interferes with honest communication, and distracts from the shared goal. People become frustrated when conflict prevents them from achieving what they want to achieve. They may react through aggression, compromise or avoidance; each of these makes the situation worse than it was. The result is a diversion of the groups attention to perceived problems with the collective enterprise: a language of deficit in which not merely the shared goal, but the group itself becomes a problem to be solved.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Bellman writes of the commitment, passion, and aspiration for a larger life (2000, p. 68) which energize people who seek to change the world for the better. If we can see the beauty in our collaborations, we can release the creativity that comes from a compelling vision of a future worth working for. \r\n\r\nHuman beings, the groups and organizations we work in, and the world we inhabit all contain the potential for this larger life. Through consistent attention to what is alive, and to what can be alive in the future, we can become more alive. The belief that that people are good and that they respond positively to being treated accordingly is well-grounded in research on the Pygmalion effect (Cooperrider, 1990). We respond to positive images of ourselves by regarding others more positively: by noticing their successes, remembering their strengths, and seeing challenges from a positive aspect.\r\n\r\nAn appreciative approach adopts a fourfold cycle of discovery, dreaming, design and destiny (Cooperrider & Whitney, 1999). It starts not by identifying a need or deficit, but by discovering the best of the current situation. It dreams or envisions what a better future might be, rather than analyzing what caused the deficit. In place of planning how to redress a deficit, it collectively constructs a design for a better future. Instead of acting to resolve a problem, this approach enacts a better future as its destiny.\r\n\r\nTo enact a better future suggests that a life-affirming end is a natural outcome of life-affirming means; we aspire to larger life in the world through larger life in ourselves and in our collaborations. If we learn to be drawn together by a positive image of each other, our collective effort enhances the potential for creative, fresh human action toward a life-enhancing purpose (Srivastva & Barrett, in Srivastva & Cooperrider, 1990, p. 386).\r\n \r\nThis can succeed if we continually revise our expectations of what we can achieve: to open new possibilities for ourselves, for those we collaborate with, and for the world we hope to improve. This requires that we continually learn by developing and revising the norms, strategies and assumptions which specify what work gets done and what work is important to do (Dixon, 1999, p. 48). We need to maintain a dialogue, with ourselves and others, about our individual and shared assumptions. \r\n\r\nTo better understand the value of others, we must suspend our own assumptions. People are seldom malicious or idiotic, but they often work from different assumptions; once we can understand these assumptions we can appreciate their value. For this reason, appreciating differences is critical to collaboration. Once we appreciate others concerns (Spinosa et al., 1997), we can embark on a dialogue about how to work together.\r\n\r\nAppreciative collaboration assumes that differences are valuable, and focuses attention on what is positive in any situation; in place of a vocabulary of deficit, it offers a forward-looking language of hope. Combined with a clear shared vision, appreciative collaboration allows us to achieve life-affirming goals through life-affirming means.', 'Positive images of the future lead to positive actions.

How do people learn how to participate with a critical and reflective perspective?', 'The journalistic pattern and communication tools noted here can be used in any field, narrow or wide, where public education and outreach as well as discussion and information sharing among key contributors and other participants are important to the vitality and development of the field.', 'There are many ways of speaking to this family of problems/issues/concerns: face-to-face get-togethers, from conversations to conferences; email/discussion lists, blogs, web sites and bulletin boards; books and articles; faxes and radioare all useful approaches.  Tying into all of these, regular publications have come to serve a key role in movement-development and community-building. Tom Paine\'s Common Sense at the beginning of the American Revolution, arousing the colonists in a radically new \"common sense\" way, and The Federalist Papers, the country\'s first major newspaper op-ed series, designed to convince people to support the newly drawn up Constitutionthese crucial works of popular journalism that helped set our country\'s founding are indicative of what can be found in any social and political movement, large or small, specialized or general.  Regular publications that cover the events and developments of a movement are indicative of the depth of thought and commitment that people have to their work and their interest in sharing it and learning from one another.  Movement/community-building journalism and their publications are most often written and produced by the actors and participants in the movement and provide reflections on the roots and meanings of specific contributions to the field; they tie particular events and achievements, programs, institutions, and actors to a wider field of interconnected activities that together point toward renewed possibilities for people creating a healthier and more democratic common world.  Consider professional academic disciplines, how they all have their many journals (international, national, regional) and their growing on-line availability and distribution, and their importance to developing cohesion and direction in their respective communities of practice.  Consider the situation among artists, social workers, leftists, conservatives, citizens of any size viable community.  In American political life, consider the longevity of key political journals and how they have not only reflected trends and movements but helped define the movements themselves and provided an arena for its participants to learn about and from one anotherthat strand of radical liberalism that has characterized The Nation from its inception as a vocal anti-slavery voice, the descent from progressive liberalism to neoconservatism represented by The New Republic, the development and fracturing of the radical political culture and politics of eastern European Jewish immigrants as found in The Partisan Review, Dissent, and Commentary. \r\n\r\nIn the field of community media and technology, the Community Technology Review (www.comtechreview.org) reflects several useful pattern features of current community-building journalism:\r\n\r\n	CTR has served as the formal and informal publication of both the Community Technology Centers\' Network, www.ctcnet.org, the country\'s oldest and largest association of nonprofit and community organizations dedicated to providing emerging technology resources for those who don\'t ordinarily have effective access, and of the Association for Community Networking (www.afcn.org), the affiliation of institutions and individuals interested in developing community-wide information resources and tools. CTR has covered key directions and issues of its two prime organizational partners by placing them within the developments of the wider field of community media and technology. Thus, for example, the fall 1999 issue was a joint production of CTCNet, AFCN, and the Alliance for Community Media (ACM, www.alliancecm.org), the national association of community cable public, education, and governmental (PEG) access centers; ACM and community cable access center development receive on-going coverage.  CTR has maintained close relations with the Community Media Review, ACM\'s official publication; with the fairly-recently established Journal of Community Informatics (http://ci-journal.net), the international journal of what is emerging as the emerging academic discipline of the field, especially outside the United States; with the Digital Divide Network, the online communication environment (at www.digitaldividenetwork.org) that has done so much to address issues involving the problem identified in its name; and with the Nonprofit Technology Enterprise Network (www.nten.org), the association of nonprofit technology assistance providers, and has offered  ongoing coverage of NTEN, Circuit Riders, CompuMentor/TechSoup and other organizations/developments in this part of the field. To the degree it is a model, CTR suggests that coverage of key organizations in a field provide a useful map that can be of assistance to both the experienced actor and the new participant looking for information and guidance.\r\n\r\n	CTR is published simultaneously on-line and in hard copy, using state-of-the-art tools most appropriate to each environment.  The developing on-line environment has been designed with open source publishing tools (Movable Type/Drupal) that provide a large number of embedded hyperlinks for readers to easily explore special areas and references in depth, extensive searching capacity throughout the archives (www.comtechreview.org/issue.php), interactive options for reader comments/additions and communication with authors and editors.  Desktop publishing is tied to appropriate printer and print-on demand options for hard copy production and distribution, providing a tangible publication for those readers and occasions where hard copy availability is especially appropriate and useful.  With the growing number of links to community-produced audios and videos, CTR provides an integrated multi-media platform that models a variety of approaches that can be used.\r\n\r\n	Articles are written by a combination of recognized leaders in the field and first-time authors who have worked on innovative projects and new resources.  With first-time authors, editorial staff have expended substantial time in providing writing and editorial assistance.  Overall, the tone and approach towards the reader is one that assumes an interest and some familiarity with the field but one that seeks to provide explanations and meanings when technical or field \"jargon\" or acronyms are used; in general the CTR seeks to welcome the reader into an on-going conversation among some of the major practitioners and leaders in the field (hence the inclusion and important role of photos of authors and individuals who are participants in the events covered).  In contrast to so-called \"objective\" or \"neutral\" journalism and reportage, movement building journalism engages both the producers and readers in a way that builds and strengthens their communities.', 'Develop journalism and communication venues that present news, events, and developments in a field in-depth, covering key organizations and institutions to offer a map and guide, using the most appropriate communication tools for participant leaders and actors.

(647, 627, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'Because technology and technological systems can play out in so many ways, this is one of the longest problem statements in the pattern language. \r\n\r\nTechnological systems are often portrayed as nearly miraculous <i>solutions</i> to problems both real and imagined. For this reason, people put faith in technology that is not always warranted. Moreover, the technologists peddling techno-utopian visions in which technology causes problems to vanish &mdash; essentially by magic &mdash; are not subjected to the same scrutiny that other societal prognosticators receive. For one reason, technologists by virtue of their special knowledge and unfathomable jargon are often intimidating to non-technologists. \r\n\r\nAn unquestioning reliance on technology can result in a technocratic culture where people come to expect technological solutions. Technology puts major decisions in the hands of the technologists; degrades public discussion; diverts attention, discussion, and funds. Socio-technological systems generally have implicit trajectories. They\'re often implemented as \"total programs\" when almost by definition they are partial solutions that don\'t address or the social aspects either with analysis, co-design, education or funding. This is what is generally lacking when introducing computers into the classroom or in discussions about bringing inexpensive laptops to the children of Africa. \r\n\r\nThe use of technology often introduces new problems including ones that humankind is not prepared for. (And then of course \"technology will solve the new problems.\") Introducing mandatory laptop computers in a middle school or high school, for example, soon leads to additional issues. Should students be able to use Instant Messenger during class? Download movies? Play fantasy baseball? As was pointed out in the play, Mitzi\'s Abortion (Hefron, 2005), based on a true story, technology can tell a pregnant woman that the baby she\'s carrying has no brain, but it can\'t provide any guidance on what she can do about the situation or how to negotiate with her insurance company to help her with financial burdens that may arise. Technology can be used for dumbing down (and having technology shouldn\'t be an excuse for ignorance &mdash; Why learn anything when I can simply find the knowledge on the Internet whenever I want to!). \r\n\r\nMoreover, it almost goes without saying that technology is the near perfect candidate for systems of exploitation, control, and surveillance. Machines will never be seized with doubts about ethics or morality as a human pressed into an inhuman situation may be. On the other hand, we must continually remind ourselves that technology breaks down. It is not perfect and never will be. The large number of failed tests of the Strategic Defense Initiatives, the mixed results of laptops in schools, the quiet withdrawal of facial recognition systems for \"homeland security,\" and the potential for economic collapse due to unanticipated results of automated buying and selling all show the imperfection of our technological creations. The irony is, however, that technology might be most dangerous when it works correctly. For example, wouldn\'t a total failure of nuclear or biological weapons be preferable to \"success?\" Although Isaac Asimov presumed that humans would never allow robots to make life or death decisions or take the life of a human, the \"launch on warning\" computerized systems in the US (and presumably Russia) are virtually the same, minus the anthropomorphic features we\'ve come to expect in our robots.', 'Virtually anybody who is alive today will be confronted with new technology that is likely to change the circumstances of their life.', 'The interesting and more useful use of the word <I>criticism</I> is as it is used in art or literary criticism,, namely the analysis, evaluation, interpretation and judging of something. Technology, or, rather, its <I>practice including discourse, development, use, education, funding, regulation, and disposal,</I> in addition to its physical embodiment, deserves this type of attention like all other aspects and creations of humankind. \r\n\r\nAlthough technology, and ICT particularly, has a variety of attributes &mdash; or \"affordances\" &mdash; that will allow / encourage new capabilities (while discouraging others) and individual people obviously will play important roles in technology use (in the small?), the extreme \"weight\" of the social context will always exert considerable impact. The mistake that people most frequently make is forgetting the fundamental fact that technology in all of its guises is applied within specific social contexts. In other words, the phrase <i>Guns don\'t kill people, people kill people</i> could be more accurate if it read, <i>Guns don\'t kill people, they just vastly improve the ease and efficiency of doing so.</i> Without the \"need\" to shoot people only a fraction of the world\'s arsenal would exist. There is no such thing as \"technology by itself\" and, therefore, it makes no sense to view it in those terms. \r\n\r\nThe Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly called \"Star Wars\" illustrates many of the reasons why techno criticism is so necessary. Basically untestable, demonstrably unreliable, The SDI effort escalates militarism at the expense of non-military solutions while removing large sums of money from other more worthwhile enterprises. Additional militarization of space and the development of the next-generation of nuclear weapons also cry out for very deep technocriticism. \r\n\r\nOne of the most visible, current manifestations of techno-utopianism is that revolving around the prospects of a new \"$100 Laptop\" ostensibly for the children of Africa. Although many people believe that computers have intrinsic \"subversive\" nature that would empower people around the world it\'s not at all clear to me why African kids would be less attracted to <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> or other violent, time-squandering video games, then, say, their American counterparts if a brand-new laptop computer was suddenly in their possession. \r\n\r\nA last example provides a glimpse of what can happen when fast computers and knowledge of human behavior are combined within specific systems of power. In a provocative article entitled, \"AI Seduces Stanford Students\" (200_) Kevin Poulsen describes a phenomenon called the \"chameleon effect\" in which \"People are perceived as more honest and likeable if they subtly mimic the body language of the person they\'re speaking with.\" Now scientists at Stanford University\'s Virtual Human Interaction Lab have demonstrated that computers can exploit the same phenomenon, but with greater success and on a larger scale. Sixty-nine student volunteers interacted with a realistic human face, a computer generated \"digital agent\" that delivered a three-minute persuasive speech. Unbeknownst and undetected by seven out of eight students, the talking head was mimicking their every expression &mdash; eye movements, head tilts, etc. \r\n\r\nThe ominous result of this experiment was that the students reported that the echoing \"agent\" was \"more friendly, interesting, honest, and persuasive\" than the one that didn\'t blindly ape the facial movements of its mark. One doesn\'t need excess paranoia to imagine what lay in store for us when ubiquitous mass media systems, perhaps two-way, are joined with the system described above. Poulsen describes one way in which this could be accomplished. <blockquote> \"Bailenson [the Stanford researcher] says the research not only shows that computers can take advantage of our psychological quirks, but that they can do it more effectively than humans can because they can execute precise movements with scientifically optimized timing. The killer app is in virtual worlds, where each inhabitant can be presented with a different image, and the chameleon effect is no longer limited to one-on-one interaction. A single speaker &mdash; whether an AI or a human avatar &mdash; could mimic a thousand people at once, undetected, transforming a cheap salesman\'s trick into a tool of mass influence.\" </blockquote> Ironically the people who are best equipped to apply this pattern are the people who know the most about how technology is designed, deployed, marketed, etc. <i>Technophiles probably make the best Technocritics.</i> This is an argument for technical education that is integrated with the humanities and the social sciences, marriage that many people in the non-technical disciplines might find as distasteful as those in the technical disciplines do. A society that was technologically literate would not \"throw technology at problems\" any more than they\'d \"throw money at problems.\" That, however, is not at all the same as saying that technology or money never can help solve problems &mdash;\' as both resources when applied wisely can help immensely. \r\n\r\nOrganizations like Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility who have worked with issues like SDI and electronic voting and groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists and Electronic Privacy Information Center are working in this area. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists provides thoughtful discussion on matters of weapons and national security. The world is ready for discussions in this area that aren\'t dominated by the media and the digerati. Many policy options come to mind, but in general, they should be based on informed public discourse. One intriguing example of this is the \"co development laws\" in Scandinavia in the 1980s in which new technology could not be introduced without the consent of the workers. Another ripe field is that of genetic engineering of seeds and other biological entities. \r\n\r\nLuddism is not an answer to the question of \"autonomous technology\" anymore than it is to uncritically embrace it. The solution is not to totally eschew the use of technology in society. Technology is an integral part of the human condition. At the same time it is important for the reasons discussed above to acknowledge and to consider how technology is presented, designed, discussed, implemented and used, just as other activities, particularly ones with similar potential for large-scale disruption should be subjected to this scrutiny. Unfortunately there is a surprising number of people who interpret any of this discussion as being \"anti-technology\" (which is barely even thinkable). At any rate, this reaction has a chilling effect on the idea of actual conversations on the technology (as would befit a democratic society) and has the adverse effect of reinforcing the stereotype that technologists are binary thinkers who are simply not capable of more nuanced thought. \r\n\r\nLangdon Winner, one of the intellectual founders of technocriticism (along with Lewis Mumford, Norbert Weiner, and, even, Dwight Eisenhower) made these statements in relation to the advent of ubiquitous digital computer networks: <blockquote>As we ponder horizons of computing and society today, it seems likely that American society will reproduce some of the basic tendencies of modernism.<ul><li>unequal power over key decisions about what is built and why;</li><li>concerted attempts to enframe and direct people\'s lives in both work and consumption; </li><li>the presentation of the future society as something nonnegotiable; </li><li>the stress on individual gratification rather than collective problems and responsibilities; </li><li>design strategies that conceal and obfuscate important realms of social complexity.</li></ul> </blockquote> Although technological systems can be extremely powerful, they are subject to a number of limitations that must be understood and probed thoroughly if these systems are to be deployed effectively in society. A more visible, inclusive and engaging practice of Techno Criticism could go a long way towards educating society on the myriad implications &mdash; both creative and destructive &mdash; of technology in today\'s world. \r\n\r\n\r\nIntroductory graphic is from <a href=\"http://www.lmgo.com/lmgo/portfolio/mcdonalds.html\">http://www.lmgo.com/lmgo/portfolio/mcdonalds.html.</a>', 'Technology often alters power relations between people, generally amplifying the power for some and not for others. The development of new military technology through history dramatically illustrates this phenomenon. The distribution of computers in society is yet another example. Generally, rich people have them and poor people don\'t. If computers enable people to be more productive (as computer related companies assert) then economic benefits would obviously accrue to those that have them. People need to understand or at least anticipate to some degree not only the effects of specific technological artifacts (RFID in running shoes, for example) but the socio-technological systems that they support or destabilize.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-01-04 12:31:49', '2007-03-12 11:10:09', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Unfortunately this most often deprives whole societies and the world\'s poorest people of their right to an equitable sense of well-being and opportunity.', 'Corruption, although illegitimate, is a common mechanism of social domination. In one basic form it exacts a price from people with little power in exchange for a \"favor\" from someone with more power. In another form, two or more people or organizations with power swap \"favors\" for mutual advantage. The \"favor\" can be large or small and it can be granted or denied at the pleasure of the power-holder, whose criteria, rationale, and legitimacy for the decision is hidden and, therefore, unavailable for  review or criticism. Although the degree of corruption varies from place to place, everybody at one time or another can be a victim, however indirectly. Journalists, business people, government officials, activists, educators as well as \"ordinary\" people - citizens - are affected by corruption and can play a role in its prevention.', 'At its most basic level, \"Transparency\" is \"the quality of being able to be seen through.\" When used in a social context it means \"easily detected, understood: obvious, evident.\" To exhibit transparency means that the reality of how things actually work is not occluded by false or misleading layers of artifice. Transparency thus helps shed light on corrupt practices that thrive on secrecy. \r\n\r\nAt a time when concern is mounting over the seemingly overwhelming range of problems facing our world, the principle and initiatives of transparency advocates are gaining momentum and significant interest within a broadening global discourse. While rights to privacy and protection are critical benchmarks in evaluating the relative health of a democracy, deterrents and penalties to corruption are essential if efforts designed to invigorate social justice are to become more successful. \r\n\r\nIt turns out that the relatively simple approach of making transactions &mdash; both monetarily and information-based &mdash; of the powerful <i>visible</i> has the desired effect of discouraging corruption and encouraging good works. Learning about corruption is a first step towards rooting it out &mdash; but it\'s only the initial step. Rooting out corruption is often a long, frustrating, thankless and sometimes dangerous enterprise. A corrupt court system, for example, is likely to free guilty people in certain instances, and non-corrupt judges may pay with their lives when they act to convict guilty people. \r\n\r\nNiccolo Machiavelli introduced the familiar social equation, \"Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely\" that asserts that corruption is an inevitable consequence of power, and that the greater the power - the greater the resultant corruption. Machiavelli\'s perspective reminds us why citizens are naturally suspicious, for example, of secret meetings between government officials and corporate executives. For example, when Bush administration officials met behind closed doors with executives from the world\'s biggest energy corporations to discuss U.S. energy policy. \r\n\r\nIn truth, Machiavelli\'s wisdom provides governments with ample incentive for making such meetings more open or \"transparent.\" Corruption is not intrinsically the province of one political party or another. It does thrive, however, in situations where secrecy and fear are prevalent. The Enron and WorldCom scandals certainly provided lessons that were largely responsible for the whistleblower protection provisions of the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\" in the U.S.\r\n\r\nOn the international front, groups that adopt transparency as a prerequisite to their work while providing expert advice, include IISD (International Institute for Sustainable Development), whose model <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/IISD.pdf\">\"Multilateral Agreement on Investment for Sustainable Development\"</a> brought the convention of sustainability to influence within OECD (Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development) &mdash; by helping design both legal and policy instruments on foreign investment. \r\n\r\nWhile numerous projects and symposia have focused on transparency, two relatively recent events are especially relevant to this pattern\'s \"big picture\" at a most sensitive time in human history. They are the <a href=http://ww1.transparency.org/in_focus_archive/30th_ratification/30th_ratification.html>United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)</a> and the ongoing, <a href=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_security/china/ucs-china-joint-workshops-on-transparency.html>USC (Union of Concerned Scientists) Transparency Project (2000-2001)</a> that has been working for over a decade to foster the \"intellectual and institutional capacity to increase transparency through participation in international arms control negotiations\".  \r\n\r\nThe Transparency pattern is very general and can be applied in various cultures and in various situations that include the following: <ul></li><li> Disaster aid and reconstruction, such as that related to the Southeast Asian tsunami\r\n</li><li> Decisions about what articles to run in newspapers or on television news shows\r\n</li><li> Source of funding for columnists\r\n</li><li> Decisions about corporate executive salaries and severance packages\r\n</li><li> Inspectors of new construction, fish harvests, food quality, tax returns\r\n</li><li> Building permits and other land-use decisions\r\n</li><li> \"Revolving door\" between executives in weapons corporations and government officials who buy from them\r\n</li><li> Lobbying government officials (versus bribes for legislative support)\r\n</li><li> Welfare systems\r\n</li><li> Judicial systems\r\n</li><li> Money laundering, or support or opposition to banking transparency legislation\r\n</li><li> Attendance at government meetings by corporate executives to decide policies where they are the direct beneficiaries</ul>One of the greatest strengths of transparency as a social pattern can be found in its inclusiveness. Highlighting this point are grassroots activists who are elevating public awareness and forming alliances with many types of people and groups. As a result the \'practice of transparency\' is becoming a model of increasingly influence. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 1999 the Poder Ciudadano (Citizen Power) an NGO group based in Argentina \"negotiated an integrity pact with the city government of Buenos Aires\", to monitor a 1.2 billion dollar subway construction project to \"root out corruption\". Across political, economic, industrial, scientific, legal, and civic sectors numerous reform initiatives are being coordinated providing benchmarks for accountability and success that are being applauded. These evolving strategies have resulted in a holistic \"integrity approach\" towards waging a unified struggle against corruption. The resulting \'victories\' provide a great ray of hope for countries and peoples ravaged by decades &mdash; or centuries &mdash; of tyranny. Hence, \'transparency\' is now poised to have a greater and greater influence on enforcing Civil Society values over time. \r\n\r\nTransparency International was launched by people who shared a \"common experience of having witnessed first hand the devastating effects of cross-border corruption\" and is now providing leadership in the battle against corruption worldwide. Over the years Transparency International has developed a wide range of useful tools and information resources. These include: <ul><li> TI Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), the best known of TI\'s tools. It has been credited with putting the issue of corruption on the international policy agenda. The CPI ranks more than 150 countries in terms of perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys.\r\n</li><li> Global Corruption Barometer: A survey that assesses general public attitudes toward and experience of corruption in dozens of countries around the world.\r\n</li><li> Global Corruption Report: 2006 focuses on the health sector, where lack of integrity can be a matter of life and death.\r\n</li><li> TI Integrity Pact (IP): A tool aimed at preventing corruption in public contracting; consisting of a process that includes an agreement between a government department (at the federal, national or local level) and all bidders for a public contract. The IP also introduces a monitoring system that provides for independent oversight and accountability.\r\n</li><li> TI Bribe Payers Surveys: Annual tool that evaluates the supply side of corruption - the propensity of firms from industrialized countries to bribe abroad.\r\n</li><li> Business Principles: This comprehensive reference aims to provide a practical tool to which companies can look for a comprehensive reference to good practice to counter bribery. Designed as a starting point for businesses to develop their own anti-bribery systems or as a benchmark.\r\n</li><li> TI Integrity Pact (IP) is a tool aimed at preventing corruption in public contracting.</li></ul>Transparency is fundamental to the evolution of a just and humane civil society. Focusing on transparency should help thwart corruption at the root(s) and help create new solutions to age-old problems stemming from greed, fear, anger and stupidity.\r\n\r\nA concentrated effort to foster visibility is fundamental for the success of this project. Humanity has much to learn from the many tangible gains and policy shifts that are taking effect. As stated at the beginning of this pattern, corruption in its various guises can deprive whole societies of opportunity and a sense of well-being. This reality beckons us to develop constructive innovations that stand at the vortex of change. If we are successful, this work holds the promise of giving new life to the testimony and values of peace, justice and solidarity for generations to come.', 'Using traditional, as well as new forms of on-line media and ICT, we can continue to raise public awareness about specific struggles over transparency while exposing, protesting and defying corruption at all levels. It is important at the same time to continue to broaden the support for  transparency initiatives and enforcement. In this way, more accountability can be demanded which can be translated into the development of equitable practices and policies.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-01-11 14:51:10', '2007-03-18 08:17:33', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project', NULL, 335, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(649, 629, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'Because almost all contemporary societies are androcentric (male-centered), womens needs, interests, ideas, and perspectives on the world are often ignored or trivialized. Androcentrism perpetuates a patriarchal system that oppresses women and severely constrains (and damages) mens lives as well.  An orientation toward social change that gives voice to womens perspectives and strives to replace patriarchy with an egalitarian, matrifocal society would go a long way toward creating a just and peaceful world for all.', 'Although societies differ in the degree and form which male dominance takes, male privilege is generally maintained through systems of beliefs, laws, discriminatory practices, and cultural norms (including direct or indirect perpetuation of male violence). Patriarchy concentrates social, political, and economic power in the hands of men at the expense of women. Because gender oppression is ancient and insidious, a conscious effort is needed to recognize the gendered dimensions of social problems. Looking at the world with a matrifocal orientation can help create contexts in which women-centered analyses of social problems are fully incorporated into problem-solving processes.', 'A matrifocal orientation to social change draws directly on womens experience and knowledge and puts the needs of oppressed women at the center of social transformation.  Matrifocal societies, real and imagined, do not challenge patriarchy by offering its mirror image--with women in positions of dominance over men.  Rather, they embrace values traditionally seen as feminine: peace, nurturance, cooperation, and care for those most in need. A matrifocal society is one in which dominance over others is not supported (neither as an individual or collective goal).  The needs and contributions of women are valued equally with those of men. Womens interests are not special interests but human interests.  Social distinctions between males and females may be minimized [depending on the culture], and those biological/social differences that remain do not inhibit womens full participation in the society.   A matrifocal orientation to social change recognizes that the rising of the women means the rising of the [human] race (Oppenheim, ____).  \r\n\r\nThe need for womens voices to be heard in order for society to become more just, has been recognized by progressive social reformers for centuries (and probably longer).  This awareness led to the development of women-centered movements throughout the world.  As a social/political orientation, the Matrifocus pattern is reflected in both feminist organizing in first world nations and community-centered womens organizing in Third world nations.  Historically, many Third World womens organizations have been concerned with conditions of economic hardship, displacement, and state-sponsored violence affecting their communities as a whole, while first world feminist groups have focused more exclusively on womens social and political rights.  In recent decades the issue of violence against women has been a common theme of transnational women organizing ( Keck and Sikkink, 1998).  Regardless of the issue, whenever women organize with the goal of creating a more just and sustainable society, they are endeavoring to insert their voices and their perspectives into the public debate. By doing so, they are subverting the androcentric norm of male power and female silence.\r\n\r\nLas Madres de Plaza de Mayo, for example, were able to subvert androcentric norms after initially making use of them. The simultaneous cultural respect for motherhood and perceived political irrelevance of women, allowed Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo to protest relatively unhindered at a time when public demonstrations were officially illegal in Argentina. By also making themselves visible beyond national borders, Las Madres fostered a successful international advocacy network to pressured government investigation into state sponsored murders during the Pinochet regime.  The powerful example of Argentinean mothers refusing to be silent has inspired other womens groups, such as Women in Black in Israel and elsewhere, to stand out publicly against state sponsored violence. \r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, many organizations that can be described as having a matrifocal orientation have been womens organizations.  But this is not required by the pattern.  Labor groups reflect a matrifocal orientation when they strive for gender equity policies, family leave policies, the right to organize in traditionally female occupations, and increased female union leadership. Anti-globalization groups demonstrate a matrifocal orientation when they recognize the significant impact of trade policies on women, and when they give voice to womens knowledge as farmers, workers, parents, and preservers of culture. Environmental groups like the Chipko movement in India or EcoFeminists in the U.S. reflect a matrifocal orientation when they draw upon and amplify the voices of women, highlight reproductive issues as environmental issues, and speak with reference to the future of all children on the planet.  \r\n\r\nRegardless of whether a group consists of men or women or both, having a matrifocal orientation means that people ask, How is the problem we perceive exacerbated by patriarchy, and how has our way of responding to it been limited by patriarchal thinking?\"  Resisting androcentric norms by putting womens perspectives in the center, rather than the periphery, of social debates is a first step toward undermining patriarchy and the social ills it perpetuates.\r\n\r\nOne problem with the Matrifocal pattern is its potential to reinforce male-female dichotomies. Whenever people speak up for traditionally feminine goals and valuesparticularly when they use the role of motherhood for political leverage--they run the risk of reifying patriarchal beliefs about the essential nature of women. Many reactionary movements have argued that their goals and strategies are in the best interests of women, and female voices are often used to promote these messages.   Many western feminists, for example, have been hesitant to organize under the banner of motherhood not only because many women chose not to be mothers, but also because such representations may inadvertently bolster the idea that motherhood is womens single most important function in society.  Activist who use a matrifocal orientation must be careful to distinguish between biological femaleness and matrifocal goals.  There are many males that value peace, nurturance, care for those in needs, collaborative problem solving, and an end to reward-oriented hierarchies.  There are also many females that are not interested in creating a just society and prefer to amass what benefits they can within the current social order; some fully support patriarchy. Matrifocal is not synonymous with female or maternal.\r\n\r\nA second problem with a matrifocal orientation is the misperception that everyone who adopts it will, or should, agree on particular social goals and political strategies.  They wont.  What is shared by people who adopt a matrifocal orientation is a consciousness that overcoming problems of violence, economic oppression, and gender oppression, requires replacing patriarchy with an alternative social order, and that increasing womens participation in the public sphere is one step in such a transformation.', 'A matrifocal orientation keeps the system of patriarchy visible so that alternatives can be imagined and created.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-01-16 14:59:04', '2007-03-05 09:57:01', NULL, NULL, 'TESC', NULL, 313, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Unfortunately the way that societies deal with these issues can make a bad situation worse. Traditional systems of blame and punishment and even reparations all too often simply create additional harm.', 'In the 21st Century formal judicial systems centered on a national government and the courts are losing ground to new models of adjudication and problem-solving. Some communities are reverting to long-standing traditions for healing, cleansing and restoring community balance. Others are taking up a more modern idea, the creation of a Truth Commission to take testimony from the victims and perpetrators in a conflict. These bodies range in scope and scale from the famous South African hearings covering thousands of cases spanning thirty years, to the Greensboro NC (USA) hearings about a single local catastrophe. Commission hearing rooms offer a forum for contact across previously insurmountable barriers of hostility, which can inspire a traditional enemies to build a newly shared investment in the future.', 'Community organizations dealing with local traumatic events, families with a personal story of injustice, even an entity as large as the United States with its dark history of slavery can consider creating a Truth, Reconciliation and Amnesty Commission. A Commission holding hearings will allow the actual history to be revealed by taking testimony from a wide variety of perspectives, and will also become a forum in which adversaries can approach each other without insisting on punishment or revenge. Perhaps surprisingly, a narrative, anecdotal yet full recounting of painful truth contributes substantially to restoring the harmony and vitality of the community for the future.\r\n\r\nSouth Africas is the most famous Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but there have been dozens of others.Many have played an important role in repairing community rifts without furthering the suffering for most people. In South Africa, an indigenously inspired and funded project, heard thousands of testimonies and disposed of over 3000 requests for amnesty. Guatemalas TRC was more centralized and UN sponsored. A key outcome of the latters work came in an apology from the United States for its abusive interventions Guatemalan affairs. \r\n\r\nTRCs offer a substitute for traditional disaster adjudication systems, which usually take one of the following three forms: insurance payments/liability law suits, government investigations/hearings, criminal trials and punishments. While each of these has its place, all three are concerned above all with blame for the past. Furthermore, legal and official procedures traditionally depend on arcane jargon and they tend to be expensive, long drawn out and highly centralized. Since they are dominated by experts, traditional dispute forums tend to marginalize the ordinary people who actually experience traumatic events. UN War Crimes Tribunals for Rwanda and Bosnia, which refuse to consider amnesty, have been bedeviled by the failings of court-based systems.\r\n\r\nTRC style hearings are quite different. They are relatively informal so they are commensurately cheaper and can take place anywhere in an affected area. If they follow the South African model, hearings are not adversarial, they do not assign guilt or innocence and they are carried out in the local, natural language. In 2004 in Greensboro NC, hearings about 1979 slaughter of four civil rights activists offered an opportunity for people to continue on with a process that had actually been cut off in the courts. \r\n\r\nTRC Commissioners need to attend openheartedly to the voices of suffering, to ask probing questions about responsibility and action so as to determine if the truth has indeed been told. Their success depends on the integrity of these commissioners. It also depends on careful recording and distribution of the testimonies. Participation, both for witnesses and those accused of doing harm has traditionally been voluntary, in the sense that no-one faces additional legal sanctions from their society for failing to appear, though community hostility can be hard on those who reject the Commissions request to appear.\r\n\r\nThe strongest argument against TRC proceedings is precisely the strongest argument in favor of them  that such hearings are not the forum for punishing a perpetrator. Victim opponents of TRCs fear being deprived of justice. Perpetrators worry that the hearings are merely fishing expeditions to search out the guilty who will then be punished. Theorists are concerned that perpetrators who are not prosecuted under such a system will find they can act with impunity In South Africa some victims remained critical to the end, but many discovered that the new knowledge they gleaned at the hearings about what happened and why proved much stronger in easing their hearts than the had expected. And nothing about these hearings need prevent judicial action. Indeed in recent years there have been examples of re-opening judicial proceedings with a similar intent, for example the 2005 recreation and new trial of Chief Leshi leading his exoneration in Washington State, a hundred years after his execution.\r\n\r\nEstablishing a successful commission depends on preparing the groundwork on many issues. The factors identified by the Truth Commission Project (see below) include\r\n# By whom/under whose name the commission is established\r\n# When the commission is established and how far back it reaches \r\n# Prevailing focus on healing or justice\r\n# Public support for a truth commission\r\n# Geographic horizon for Investigation\r\n# Legal Powers of Investigation\r\n# Rejecting anonymous and confidential testimonies\r\n# Visibility of Hearings\r\n# Degree of Formality of Hearings\r\n# Whether or not to offer Amnesty\r\n#  Completion, Publication and Distribution/ Accessibilityof report\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile most actual TRC hearings have been conducted in former war zones, it is easy to discern other issues which could benefit from this process: \r\n\r\n1) The United States government and the American people could people re-examine the costs of the slave trade and the centuries of slave labor and yet minimize the likelihood that the acknowledgement of history becomes the basis furious revenge.\r\n2) Or the people and the different levels of government could investigate the events of the New Orleans 2005 catastrophe without focusing narrowly on blame and thereby prompting an onslaught of liability law suits.\r\n3) Or the residents and former residents of Hanford-Washington, Chernobyl-Ukraine, and Ukraine, and Bikini Island and other nuclear sites could craft public history out of the secrecy which surrounded the nuclear programs of the 20th century. At the same time they would create a forum for dialogue with the builders of the weapons and power plants who have left behind a radioactive legacy that will last for millennia.\r\n\r\nThis pattern links to Memory and Responsibility, Transparency, Community Inquiry, International Law', 'Therefore, faced with a festering historical trauma in a specific community, create a Truth, Reconciliation and Amnesty commission, using either informal or official channels.

Such a form of expression will be holistic but concise;  definite and robust enough to promote action and reflective review, but not dogmatic or restrictive of creativity.  To be integrative, it should also fulfill the role of a lingua-franca between different interests and users.\r\n\r\nThe concept of a Pattern as developed by Christopher Alexander has been recognised as one such form of expression.  However, Alexander has produced no concise workbook to assist the layperson seeking to write an Alexandrian Pattern, thus limiting its take-up and adoption.', 'Notwithstanding the intuitive valuing of the whole that the common use of the word ', 'Within this context we have grown unused to working integratively in groups of different knowledges and interests and unused to representing the more synthetic and holistic outcomes that such working environments engender.  Nevertheless, various people are undertaking work in this regard and the idea of new languages of synthesis generated by patterns is seen to hold promise.  In particular, the work by Christopher Alexander to develop a practical alternative of creative synthesis based on pattern processes now constitutes an iterative body of theory and practice of some 40 years.  Instructively, it resonates with  - and in turn synthesises -  a number of contemporary viewpoints:  the use of systems thinking to map out intricate connections;  the idea of the whole as an unfolding of an extant order, as promoted by the physicist David Bohm;  the valuing of immediate human experience, typical of phenomenological inquiry; and the search, within chaos theory, for the patterns that make complexity manageable.\r\n\r\nHowever, notwithstanding that Alexanders work is becoming increasingly recognised, there remains a limitation:  a workbook to assist those wanting to generate their own pattern languages.  \r\n\r\nSome specific research to address this limitation (Paine, 2004) has defined a number of lessons.  This research adopted an holistic view of pattern:  extending its well-known and practised ability as a tool of analysis, perception and static design by exploring the other side of the coin, as promoted by Alexander  - the use of pattern as a tool to reveal our intuitive understandings of the whole in a way that generates positive action.  To learn more about these latter attributes, pattern practitioners from ten different fields (for example permaculture, choreography, Feldenkrais, pyschotherapy) discussed their work.  Close relationships were found between pattern and a desire to work with the whole, and between pattern and life.  The practitioners were involved in forming new patterns from existing patterns.  In doing so they used similar tools:  active observation, listening and questioning, intuitive understandings, and established lessons developed through iteration.  Their new patterns tended to be inherently more flexible than the contributory patterns, while still retaining robustness.  There was also a strong interest in using pattern as a lingua franca to aid communication between themselves and others.  The research then worked with a particular user group (in this case involved in the practice of sustainable development) to generate a specific pattern language.  This work, coupled with reference to that of Alexander, allowed the development of further lessons about the generation of pattern languages.  It was revealed that the exercise of writing the type of compound pattern envisaged by Alexander is inherently disciplined with its own rules (or patterns).  Importantly in respect to the holistic objectives of pattern languages, these rules also resonate with the nine dimensions that the research revealed when also seeking an understanding of that otherwise ineffable entity, the whole.  These comprise the eight dimensions nominated in Figure 1 plus a ninth non-written ineffable tension inherent within the illustration itself.   The rules form the Solution component of this Pattern.', 'When preparing a Pattern:\r\n\r\n1.	Extend the description and analysis aspects of a common pattern by including properties of synthesis and generativity.   \r\n2.

Reveal our experiences of this whole  - via critical observation, reflective questioning, the bracketing out of more ego-led responses, and the allocation of sufficient time to do this.\r\n4. Slice the subject matter within each Pattern discretely  - large enough to stand alone and have meaning by itself, but distinct enough so that the solution does not become muddled with other action. \r\n5. Value both intuitive and analytical knowledge  -  asking what one feels about the subject is as necessary as asking what one thinks about it\r\n6. Collaborate, with critical reflection, with prospective users  - do not write a Pattern language as an individual, or small group, acting alone.\r\n7. Appoint someone to undertake the focus and hard work necessary to transcribe this collaboration, in the manner of a mid-wife  - noting that this role is, potentially, within the ability of any aware and interested person.\r\n8. Ask, constantly, whether the Solution component can (appropriately) be implemented in many different ways, or does it (inappropriately) only define one particular response?  \r\n9.

The content and flow of information is critical at every stage, from policy development to preparation, search and rescue, recovery and the reconstruction of vital infrastructures. Therefore, to some extent, everyone may be called upon to participate in various the aspects of this pattern, not only in the area of immediate impact but in the formal development of policies, procedures and systems as well as informal, voluntary emergency responses that help to extend the safety net for those directly affected.', 'In the space of one year, 2005, the world witnessed three major natural disastersthe Southeast Asian Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina in the Southeast United States, and the Pakistani earthquakeand all were awakened to how quickly even the most basic and essential structures can literally be swept away in a matter for moments. A spotlight was also cast on pre-existing environmental conditions, policy decisions, inadequate preparation, and either dysfunctional or non-existing communication systems that either led to or intensified the extent of damage and loss of life. \r\n\r\nThis pattern encompasses three different periods that focus upon emergency situations: (1) the pre-existing conditions and preparations prior to the occurrence of any disaster, (2) the actual disaster and immediate response, and (3) the longer term recovery and reconstruction of physical and social infrastructures. While all levels of society are involved, the particular focus of this pattern is on the initiative and actions of civil society.\r\n\r\nIn the period prior to any disaster, the focus is on advocacy for effective policies, including the remediation of social and environmental conditions that might prevent or at least moderate the damage of a disaster and the establishment of evacuation, response preparations, and the storage of food and medical supplies as well as the setting up of emergency communications networks and facilities. \r\n\r\nFor example, Seattle Disaster Aid & Response Teams (SDART) calls for neighborhoods to be prepared to be self-sufficient for at least three days by organizing teams that draw upon local resources and skills. The program trains neighborhood teams and sponsors functional drills to rehearse roles and responsibilities.. \r\n\r\nIn terms of advocating for improved communications systems and facilities, the World Dialogue on Regulation for Network Economies has compiled a special dossier on the role of regulators and policymakers in ensuring that adequate emergency communications are available.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate aftermath of a disaster, the delivery of food, shelter and medical care can be hours, days, even weeks away. Tasks that must be handled by the stricken residents, as outlined and assigned to teams under the SDART model, include damage assessment, first aid, safety & security, light search & rescue, and providing sheltering & special needs. Communications responsibilities include monitoring emergency radio broadcasts, keeping neighbors informed of relevant information, relaying information about damage via amateur radio operators, satellite radio, cell phones, signs, or whatever means are available.\r\n\r\nIn the longer period of reconstruction following a disaster, when additional external resources can be brought into play, it is vitally important to ensure close coordination.\r\nThe very young and very old, as well as the poor face the greatest risk, in the short and long-term aftermath of catastrophe, often related to the worsening of already existing conditions of poor health and nutrition and inadequate housing. \r\n\r\nUNICEF studies of groups hit by warfare and famine show it is critical to provide the correct mix and balance of relief services and providing not only food but public health assistance to prevent massive outbreaks of infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nCivil society is capable of organizing large-scale efforts in the wake of disasters as demonstrated by the Katrina PeopleFinder Project and the Southeast Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog SEA-EAT blog associated with the East Asian tsunami.

The Common Alerting Protocol is one such data interchange protocol and the Partnership for Public Warming (2006) is working on a wide variety of efforts to resolve national standards, protocols and priorities. \r\n\r\nEven areas far distant from the disaster must also be prepared to handle a mass displacement of populations, possibly for extended periods of time.', 'Therefore, individuals, public agencies, environmental advocates, and international relief organizations needs to continually reassess their level of preparedness and coordination in response to humanitarian emergencies.

In those experiments, a \"doctor\" with official-looking garb tells the subject (misleadingly)  that he or she are going to be involved in a memory experiment. In the course of this experiment, the subject will push buttons that purportedly deliver increasingly powerful electric jolts to an unseen person in the next room, a confederate who doesn\'t seem to be able to master the memorization of a few words at a level that sufficiently pleases the experimenter. After the hapless person with the poor memory cries out in [feigned] pain, the real subject understandably balks at delivering more pain to the person in the next room. After the authority figure explains that they \"must continue\" with the experiment, the vast majority of the subjects elected to continue their regiment of electrical shocks to the unseen victim. A notable exception to this excursion into a morally dubious zone were people who had spent time in German concentration camps during World War II.  Many of them simply refused to deliver the punishment.\r\n\r\nOne plausible explanation is that the survivors who had actually witnessed situations in which blind obeisance to power led to barbarity, <I>learned</i> about its pitfalls, while those who had not been in such a situation had not. This suggests that video games could provide a type of rehearsal for situations that might arise in the future, serving much the same role as  it is believed that <I>play</I> does for children. \r\n\r\nIt is the possibility that video games could provide meaningful instruction that inspired Paul Rogat Loeb to propose a video game based on former U.S. Vice President Al Gore\'s \"Inconvenient Truth\" movie that explores the looming prospect of global warming and massive climate change: \"The game could build on Gores existing movie, slide show, and website, adapting whatever elements were useful, but also making the process more interactive, more engaging for an audience for whom games are a prime language. Why not put people in the role of climate scientists assessing the evidence, governmental and corporate decision makers, citizens trying to keep our society from driving off a cliff? Why not let them try out different ways of acting? (Loeb, 2006). \r\n\r\nVideo games could (at least theoretically) help society learn how to deal with various problems that people might encounter: emergencies, stolen elections, loss of civil liberties, etc, The fact is that our globalized, mediated, interconnected world thrusts a multitude of issues into our face that reveal our impotence: although they demand a response, individually we have nothing in our experience that helps us truly grapple with it &dash; let alone determine what that should be done about it. \r\n\r\nSeveral video games have been released, and several more are in planning, that are intended to teach people about real-world issues in ways that television new reports and formal education are unlikely to emulate. One game, \"Food Force\" developed by the United Nations World Food Program, puts players in the middle of a dangerous food relief mission on Sheylan, a fictional island in the Indian Ocean suffering from drought and civil war. Players airdrop food, drive down mine-infested roads, buy and distribute food and help rebuild.  Surprisingly, the game has been downloaded by over three million of people and is second in the number of free downloads only to \"America\'s Army,\" another \"serious game,\" this one a recruiting tool for the US Army (Rosenberg, 2006). \r\n\r\nThere are several new games with socially responsible orientations. One is called \"A Force More Powerful\" and designed to teach non-violent strategy. Others are based on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (PeaceMaker), genocide in Darfur, and Adventure Ecology in which two kids, Dash and Bay fight eco-threats and villains like Agent Waste and Professor Ignorance and the environment is represented as a \"a highly complex and interdependent system in which every life-form, air molecule and pebble plays a part\" (Snoonian, 2006). \r\n\r\nWhile video games are often damned because of their total disconnect from the \"real world,\" this separation may also have its virtues. According to Raph Koster (Wasik, 2006), there is a \" magic circle\" surrounding games and \"it has to be a circle games of no consequence.\" Formal education, on the other hand, generally does not have a \"magic circle of no consequence.\" In other words, failures &mdash; both small and large &mdash; at school have consequences that vary from minor annoyances and embarrassment to not being able to attend college or find meaningful employment after high school.', 'Will Wright, the designer of SimCity and other simulation games, commented on the goals he has for Spore, a new video game now in development: \"I want people to be able to step back five steps, five really big steps. To think about life itself and its potential-scale impact. I want the gamers to have this awesome perspective handed to them in a game. And then let them decide how to interpret it\" (Johnson, 2006). While we can\'t know how valid this perspective is and how his new game will promote those ways of thinking, it\'s clear that it represents a step up in relation to the majority of the other games that people play.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-04-04 23:20:05', '2006-11-03 15:29:23', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

While vote counting sounds straightforward, ensuring the accurate counting of votes in an entire country is quite difficult. Many obstacles can obstruct the democratic process including inadequate access to the voting process, inaccurate counting, late results, and results that are not convincing to the electorate. Some of these obstacles are structural, others are due to human error while others result from intentional manipulation and intimidation. Computers, which seem to offer the promise of increased speed and accuracy of collecting and counting votes accompanied by the possibility of decreased costs, offer new challenges to the legitimacy of the voting process, including high-tech election fraud.', 'Democratic states offer their inhabitants the important potential for self-governance. Their legitimacy and their effectiveness suffer when the actuality falls too short of the ideal. The responsibility for Free and Fair Elections falls on all citizens although some are in better positions for promoting and maintaining authentic democracy.', 'In national democracy, essentially the entire population of a nation above a certain age is entitled to vote on one or more questions put to the electorate, usually including what party or individuals will govern the nation. National democracy is the means of generating government for almost all industrialized nations. Furthermore, it is the stated objective of the world\'s great economic powers to eventually instigate national democracy for all the world\'s nations. For this and many other reasons, democracy is the most effective approach to producing legitimate government. \r\n\r\nDemocracies by definition face three major tasks: This pattern is concerned with the second task, determining the \"will of the people\" while others concern themselves with informing the \"will of the people\" and implementing the \"will of the people.\" Any deviation in any phase of the process calls into question the entire process. A nomination process that unfairly denies the nomination of certain people poisons the entire process; how can the voting itself then be meaningful when the candidates on the ballot are the product of a corrupt systems?\r\n\r\nWhile the forms that democracies assume vary widely, voting is a key component of each. Thus, the process by which the votes of the people are gathered and counted is critical to the government\'s claims of legitimacy, and to the continued faith of the people in their government. \r\n\r\nVoting is nearly always a critical milestone in the process of determining the people\'s will. Voting is the critical culmination of an ongoing deliberative process where decisions are actually made: between, for example, candidates vying for a position or for a new proposal to support or limit something. Because voting often determines significant issues it is often subject to immense attention and pressure. While some of this pressure is normal politicking (which varies from place to place), other is unethical, illegal and unfair. The voting process presents an irresistible opportunity for people who want things to go their way regardless of issues of fairness or legality. At the same time the voting process seems to offer innumerable opportunities for unfair interventions at nearly every stage. \r\n\r\nElections vary from place to place, in jurisdiction, in primary or final (general) elections, in selecting officials from candidates or approving or disapproving legislative changes, and most kinds of elections have a whole range of complex activities associated with them. The best recommendation depends on the goals. Beyond that, one can talk about things to avoid. So an \"antipattern\" is easier than a pattern, if a pattern is a kind of recommendation. In every case we still want \"fair elections\" however. \r\n \r\nThe expression \"Free and Fair Elections\" originated in the first post-apartheid elections in South Africa in 1994. The idea is that the outcome should be generated by a process that gives people free access to their franchise, then fairly calculates the result.\r\n\r\nHow can Fair Elections be guaranteed? What technology and administration are required to support national democracy? How can elections be trusted? What danger signs of unfair elections can we detect? What recommendations can we make? While vote counting sounds straightforward, ensuring the accurate counting of votes in an entire country is quite difficult. The requirements and constraints associated with Fair Elections introduce numerous challenges. Voters must have adequate access to the voting process, and this access must not be politically biased. The vote counting must be accurate. The results must be produced promptly.\r\n\r\nElections present a special problem, in that it must be ensured that voter person voted at most once, and each voter\'s votes were accurately counted. However, the votes of any particular voter must remain forever secret. This combination of assured accuracy and secrecy is very unusual outside of voting.\r\n\r\nElections produce results which are just vote totals (plus undervotes if they are permitted and overvotes if they are possible). Results imply outcomes: who (or what) won. Results have two metrics of quality: (1) accuracy (which obviously can\'t be measured directly) measures how closely reported results match true results; and (2) confidence (which is closely related to \"transparency\") measures the feeling in the electorate that the reported results are correct. \r\n\r\nTotal accuracy and no confidence is about as good (or as bad) as the reverse, but they lead to very different kinds of bad. What one wants is an elections process that, for an affordable cost, produces outcomes that are very rarely wrong, even though everybody recognizes that results are seldom perfectly correct. \r\n\r\nAlso, the results must be worthy of confidence. It\'s useless to produce a perfectly accurate result, if people are not persuaded that it is accurate. So there must be good reason to believe the election results. The election process must be conducted in public view, and each step of the process, as well as the process as a whole, must be comprehensible to most ordinary voters. Non-partisan officials should monitor the entire process and voting equipment should be based on open specifications and untarnished by partisan and commercial interests. The chain of custody must be carefully maintained and documented for a wide variety of materials including ballots, unvoted ballot stock, poll books, and so on.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this must be accomplished on a limited budget. Elections administration is never a particularly high spending priority.', 'In democratic societies everybody has the responsibility to help ensure Free and Fair elections.

This is particularly important during this current era of globalization and critical public issues that require public engagement. At the same time people all over the world are receiving more and more of their information from the mass media which is becoming precipitously less diverse. The control of much of the world\'s media is becomingly increasingly concentrated in a handful of giant corporations.', 'Although the exact situation will vary from place to place, virtually all communities are affected by the lack of media diversity and all communities have opportunities to help promote media diversity. In the consolidating world of corporate mass media, large companies are touting mergers and monopolistic ownership practices as being conducive to diversity of programming and community representation in broadcasting. This claim of diversity is a facade that circumvents and ignores the idea of true community access.', 'A rich, dynamic universe of public thinking helps to ensure that all sides in public matters will be taken into consideration thus promoting social &mdash; as well as economic &mdash; innovation. A paucity of diversity doesn\'t just jeopardize societal innovation however. It becomes a threat to democracy itself. When media diversity is too low, public opinion is less likely to provide the oversight that democratic societies require and is more likely to be engaged in public affairs and less willing to entertain new ideas. \r\n\r\nBen Bagdikian is generally credited with the sounding of the alarm on media concentration in the U.S. His book, The Media Monopoly (1983) revealed the disturbing fact that 50 corporations owned the majority of US media companies and this trend towards concentration was continuing. That trend has continued unabated for the 20 or so years since the original publication and now five corporations own approximately the same percentage of media output in the U.S as the 50 did in 1983. Today media corporations argue that when a company is able to monopolize a market, they can provide a more diverse array of cultures and voices than if that media landscape was broken into independently owned outlets. To use radio as a simple example, executives claim that when a corporation owns the majority of a market, the number of different formats increases dramatically. While it may be true that different formats increase, it\'s doubtfuil that this reflects an increased diversity of opinion. Many media corporations use the opportunity to record one radio show which they then rebroadcast from all of their other stations with similar formats, sometimes \"localizing\" the show with a few references (pronounced correctly hopefully). \r\n\r\nA lack of media diversity invariably means media concentration and media concentration exacerbates problems of media homogeneity. The problem of media concentration extends beyond mere banality; it represents a major threat to the ability of citizens to act conscientiously and to govern themselves as democracy requires. Media concentration brings power above and beyond what mere information provision would demand; illegitimate political and economic power invariably comes with the territory and the nearly inevitable cozy connection with political elites leads to a self-perpetuating cycle that is extremely difficult to break. When media concentration reaches certain levels, it then can keep an issue out of the public eye and, hence, off the public agenda. An important and relevant point of fact is the virtual blackout on stories involving media consolidation over the past two decades. Intense media concentration also allows companies to more easily work with government to pass legislation in its favor, notably overturning laws that combat media concentration; and not stepping on government toes because of possible retribution. It may already be too late. As Bagdikian notes, \"Corporate news media and business-oriented governments have made common cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe U.S. is not the only victim of media monopolization: Conrad Black in the U.K. and Canada, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and Rupert Murdoch in Australia (and, now, after a special act of congress, in the U.S. as well) [more?] and many others are huge players in national markets while global media consolidation is now proceeding ahead in increasingly troubling ways. \r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, when use of the Internet was beginning to explode into the among the general population &mdash; or, more accurately, of people who are relatively well-off economically, especially those who live in countries that are relatively well-off economically &mdash; some of the digerati were quite eager to dismiss any protestations over media monopolization in the \"smokestack\" (i.e. non-Internet-based) media industries that included broadcast, print and others. They reasoned that the <i>inherent</i> nature of the Internet made it more-or-less immune to human tinkering, in contrast to humankind\'s inventions. Not only was it <i>inalterable</i> but it would soon prove the obsolescence of the old-fashioned media and, at the same time, provide diversity of viewpoint despite corporate or government efforts. Within several years of the Internet\'s inception it has become incredibly commercial and now, 10 or 15 years later, a mere handful of sites accounts for half the number of sites first seen as their web browser is invoked. This is not to say that the Internet is not important. It\'s absolutely critical as millions upon millions of political actions initiated by civil society has demonstrated. And it\'s absolutely clear that citizen activism will be indispensable to prevent control from being seized gradually or not-so-gradually by corporate and/or government bodies. It\'s also clear that older forms of media should be not abandoned to corporate entities &mdash even if you believe that the Internet will put them all of business anyway! \r\n\r\nOur media and information systems do not exist in a sealed bubble independent of the capitalist structure. Because you must either own or hold stakes in a news or entertainment company to have any semblance of control over its content, the rich control our news and entertainment. While community-operated media does exist in nearly every city, its saturation and distribution into the communities is extremely low because of financial restrictions. The news and entertainment offered by these resources are vastly diverse from the corporate-owned outlets, often representing conflicting accounts and stories. Because the conflicting programming often represents the viewpoints of a different social class than of that which owns the corporations, this programming rarely makes it into the mass media. The corporate owners claim they can provide an adequate diversity of community voice, when in truth the diversity they provide is severely limited by their moneyed interests.\r\n\r\nPeople can get involved in the struggle in many ways. One of the most direct ways is to create and support independent media. This not only means developing videos, comics, zines, blogs, etc. with alterative points-of-view, it means developing funding and distribution approaches, and fighting for representation within the political system. For while it may be true that globalization and new communication technologies change the rules of the game, there are still likely to be <i>rules</i> and for this reason civil society must be vigilant: changes in protocols, domain name registry, domain servers, etc. etc. can have vast repercussions. \r\n\r\nOne of the most effective approaches, however, remains the development of public interest policy that promotes media diversity. Although critics of this approach are likely to scoff at its quaint, \"smokestack\" <i>modus operandi,</i> governments in democratic societies have an obligation to support democratic systems and the democratic experiment may be terminated earlier than anticipated by its original proponents if they fail in this duty. \r\n\r\nThe policies that governments can enact fall into two broad categories: those that limit the enclosure by the big corporations into various regions or \"markets\" and those that promote media diversity by promoting alternatives to corporate mono-cultures such as government subsidies or tax breaks to independent media or specific set-asides for radio or television spectra, etc. Media diversity represents both a desired state for the media environment and an absence of concentrated ownership of media. For that reason people need to fight for both: media diversity and diversity of media ownership.', 'Democratic societies require diversity of opinions. Although government is often negligent in this area, media corporations cannot be allowed to assume too much concentration. As in other realms, power corrupts, and media corporations are of course not exceptionss to this rule. Citizens must vigilant to ensure that a diversity of opinions is availale and that citizens have access to the media.

Hence peace education is unattractive to people with power.\r\nOn the largest historical scale there is a strong correlation between the acquisition of the full rights of citizenship and warrior status.

Since the ending of the Cold War, when it became legitimate once again think more about peace, US universities have founded significant programs, including undergraduate studies at Hampshire College, and graduate programs at George Mason University and Antioch. Europe, too, has seen considerable investment in university level education in peace studies and Europeans seem more willing than Americans to take an assertive stance in favor of peace.

This helps establish and maintain an \"us against them\" mindset which often leads to biased interpretations of information and, even, paranoia and hostility in relation to other countries. It can also be used to deny the reality or meaning of oppression and suffering in other countries and to eschew responsibility from helping to redress these problems. Generally, the particularities of specific citizenship also determine whether an individual has access to health care, education, and other rights &mdash; rights that arguably should be universal. Moreover, a narrow interpretation of citizenship implicitly cedes power to national governments whose defense of \"national interest\" can sometimes be used against its own citizens who have no legal access to a \"higher authority.\" A narrow interpretation of citizenship also restricts the participation of citizens in global affairs and global problem-solving.', 'In the waning years of the 20th century, people worldwide began to take increased notice of the world <i>outside their world.</i> At the same time the national-state, facing economic globalization and enormous challenges as the new realities, seemed to be losing its ability &mdash; as well as its interest &mdash; in promoting the welfare of its own citizens and the natural world. John Urry characterizes the situation this way: \"More generally, global money markets, world travel, the internet, globally recognized brands, globally organized corporations, the Rio Earth summit, ', 'Citizenship is generally described as the formal relationship, usually codified in law, of a person (the citizen) and a state and often is delineated in terms of <i>rights</i> and <i>responsibilities.</i> Its site has shifted from the Greek city-state where the idea first took hold to the modern nation-state whose birth is linked to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia that established the convention that countries and its citizens do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.\r\n\r\nMany nationalist political movements &mdash; the 18th century American Revolution through the 20th century Palestinian Liberation struggle &mdash; emphasized national identity and citizenship to assert their right to self-determination and political autonomy from oppressive colonial states. But history is also rife with examples of nationalism used to oppress and remove minority, and sometimes majority, populations (Nazi Germany, Sudan, Serbo-Croatia, South Africa, Israel, and the United States are just a few countries that have engaged in some form of ethnic cleansing). At the same time, the liberal concept of citizenship based on a shared national identity offers the promise of overcoming religious and ethnic divisions. From the perspective of economically disadvantaged and oppressed sub-populations, however, the promise of inclusively and shared interests has fallen flat. \r\n\r\nAppeals to the global community, through global institutions like the World Court and through transnational social movements, has become an increasingly important alternative (or supplement) to nationalist armed struggle for many minority populations. Disempowered within the Nation State, groups like <i>Via Campesino</i> bring together poor farmers and indigenous people from around the world to resist discriminatory global institutional policies and trade agreements. Of necessity, international social movements work to affect national governments, but their affiliation and their goals are as much global as they are local. \r\n\r\nThe transnational realm of global capital in a free market world, requires global civic response. As national laws are superceded by international treaties and trade agreements, individuals rights and obligations become governed by global institutionsthe reality that citizens of debt-ridden nations are well aware of. The question is not whether or not we are global citizens. The question is what form will our citizenship take. What are our rights and responsibilities toward global governing institutions and structures. Should governing bodies be directly elected by the governed? How will the rights of the weakest be protected from the strongest in the global polity? What counts as a right? What responsibilities do global citizens have to one another? \r\n\r\nWe need to ask what types of globalization are empowering to individuals and define and construct ones are likely to lead to collective problem solving. Currently there are few opportunities for people to help address shared problems. Unfortunately, this lack of opportunity comes at time when many of the problems facing humankind are global problems that require global thinking and acting. In addition to preventing people (and their ideas and other resources) from contributing to the general welfare, narrow versions of citizenship are used to establish arbitrary categories of deservedness. Our narrow version of citizenship makes it less likely that global solutions &mdash; that work for everybody &mdash; are developed. The opposite, in fact, is more likely &mdash; that collective dilemmas are \"resolved\" in ways that are relatively bad for everybody &mdash; or nearly everybody. \r\n\r\nWhat could / should people do to promote global <i>citizenship</i> &mdash; and what could / should people do to help avoid the more deleterious forms of globalization, such as global, hegemonic rule? There are two useful avenues for people to explore if we are to make headway towards realizing this pattern. The first is to assume the role and responsibilities <i>without</i> seeking permission from an authoritative source; obtaining permission would of course be impossible given that no authoritative source exists who can bestow such a designation. Assuming this role means thinking &mdash; and acting &mdash; globally; adopting the perspective that the world is densely interconnected, its general health is important and well-intentioned and well-informed citizens can play a positive role. (One caveat, however, is that if civil society continues to <i>do more</i>, there is a risk that the state will <i>do less.</i> For that reason civil society must continue to encourage the state to fulfill its obligations to the common good effectively, equitably, and transparently. The second is to actively work towards some </i>formal</i> recognition of global citizenship by, for example, helping to define and develop the intellectual and administrative scaffolding does not currently exist. Both of these paths could be undertaken individually or through working with existing or new organizations that work in these areas. \r\n\r\nArguably, full or, even, relatively engaged citizenship, is largely a myth. Even within established democracies the practice of citizenship is sporadic and shallow for most of the citizenry. In the majority of the world, citizenship as an enlightened, recognized and fulfilled condition is not even a dream. The defenders of the state-only definition of citizenship need to explain how the concept is helping people worldwide. While they\'re at it they may also explain how their model can possibly prevail against belligerent countries who pollute, over-consume resources, invade or otherwise disregard the will and well-being of the rest of the world. \r\n\r\nWhen Diogenes, the Greek philosopher, stated that he was a citizen of the world, he was refusing, according to Martha Nussbaum, \"to be defined simply by his local origins and group memberships, associations central to the self-image of a conventional Greek male; he insisted on defining himself in terms of more universal aspirations and concerns\" (Nussbaum, 2003). But to some scholars, the nation-state is the rightful and permanent well-spring of citizenship and alternative conceptualizations, however tentative and speculative are damned as heretical. Michael Walzer, for example, finds it difficult to contemplate the idea since, \"No one has ever offered me [world] citizenship, or described the naturalization process, or enlisted me in the worlds institutional structures, or given me an account of its decision procedures (I hope they are democratic), or provided me with a list of the benefits and obligations of citizenship, or shown me the worlds calendar and the common celebrations and commemorations of its citizens. As an ironic and unintended side-effect of this critique, Walzer provided a useful (if overly formal) laundry list of practical objectives that proponents of global citizenship would need to consider. \r\n\r\nThis is not to deny the possibility that some versions of \"global citizenship\" that humankind may ultimately develop &mdash; accidentally or by design &mdash; could turn out to be unspeakably evil. This possibility should surprise no one: throughout history, humankind has exhibited an enthusiastic genius for establishing hells on earth that surpass the misery of those conceived by our poets, artists and theologians. The truth is, however, that the future is generally unknowable and choice and chance will always play a part. If, for example, Florida\'s ballots had been counted in the US national elections of 2000 that country would probably not have invaded Iraq in 2003. One of the questions related to this issue, is who should determine the future of citizenship. Is this the sole domain of national governments, multi-national (or other)  corporations, international organizations, and political theorists or do citizens have some role to play? \r\n\r\nThe ultimate expression of the pattern might seem to be global homogeneity. We don\'t believe this is desirable, likely, or even possible. We envision a system of overlapping citizenships as this both exists to large extent already and seems to be workable and useful in general. It\'s important to show how (and help create situations that demonstrate how) global links are more beneficial for people than the alternative, closed, insulated and suspicious communities and nations. \r\n\r\n In a conflict that arises when \"national interest\" is pitted against broader, say world, interests, a person who explores or embraces the broader interests can be labeled as a hopeless idealist or, much worse, a traitor. But how is the \"national interest\" articulated &mdash; and by whom? Is there an ongoing process or dialogue who outcomes decides this issue? Can the state reserve the right \"by the power vested in it\" to define this concept and, further, to invoke it (however ambiguous it may be) at will as justification for arbitrary state action? \r\n\r\nAnn Florini (2005) builds a case that the Internet may help create a global consciousness that is analogous to the nationalist consciousness that the printed word helped inspire. The printing press led to a reconciliation of regional differences and a cheaper and faster way to reach constituencies that were too remote for effective collaboration. This then played a strong role in the development of the nation-state and, hence, nation-state-based citizenship. In similar fashion, Florini surmises that a new global consciousness could help usher in broader, more inclusive notions of citizenship.  \r\n\r\nAre there examples of de facto global citizenship? Organizations like \"No person is illegal\" and the Reporters / Doctors / etc. \"Without Borders\" groups are getting closer to that ideal. Are there practical experiments that could be done now &mdash; The growth of \"universal declarations,\" supporting human rights, for example, helps explain why the time might be fairly ripe for thinking like this. \r\n\r\nThe concept of global citizenship currently lacks the administrative and legalistic trappings of national citizenship that Walzer requires. Nevertheless from Diogenes to the present day, the pursuit and adoption of \"global citizenship\", however demeaned and under-institutionalized it is at present, continues to provide an compelling vision to millions of people around the world, people who are officially noted as \"belonging\" to individual, specific countries. \r\n\r\nThe bottom line, however, for everybody interested in these issues, is that people must think <i>beyond the borders</i> of the countries in which they hold citizenship. Many books speak to this issue including <em>Transnational Democracy</em> (Anderson, 2002), <em>Global Democracy</em> (Holden, 2000) and <em>Environmental Citizenship</em> (Dobson and Bell, 2006). And although these are more likely to be dynamic, idiosyncratic and short-lived, new web sites are springing into existence every day. The Internet makes it easier to learn about \"foreign\" perspectives, that while they can be as hidebound as their \"domestic\" counterparts, they help reveal the immense diversity of viewpoints on earth as well as the universality of concerns facing people everywhere.\r\n\r\nA more global focus in no way is meant to suggest that people <i>renounce</i> their citizenship. It does, however, acknowledge that one own\'s government, like <i>any</i> human institution is fallible and that concerns that arise from other countries are likely to have validity that wasn\'t obvious with the national citizenship filter in place. It may also be the case that the governments of many, if not most, are wrong on some issue and that a citizen-led, transnational approach may be <i>right.</i> \r\n\r\nAs with other patterns in this category, the journey towards the goal will be incremental, perennial, lurching, and met by setbacks as well as successes. There are tasks for many people with a wide variety of roles and responsibilities; professionals like lawyers, think-tank and NGO staff, government officials and academics can engage with the public on these issues in addition to their more specialized and technical concerns. There are hosts of organizations and projects in which people can engage. See patterns <tt>Engaged Tourism</tt> or <tt>Citizen Diplomacy</tt> for more ideas. Communication with people in other countries is especially important because this helps ensure that people realize that people in other countries are real people and not abstract non-persons. This, of course, represents a major hurdle as many people because of poverty, language barriers or other reasons cannot easily engage with people outside of their region. <blockquote><i>I accept fully the mandate for a planetary, future-oriented perspective, but seek to avoid any dogmatic assumptions that its realization depends on objective or detached knowledge. </i> (Falk, 1973)</blockquote>', 'Martha Nussbaum, in her 1994 discussion on the Stoics in \"Patriotism and Cosmopolitanism\" refers to the fact that each of us dwells, in effect, in two communities &mdash; the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration that \"is truly great and truly common, in which we look neither to this corner nor to that, but measure the boundaries of our nation by the sun\" (Seneca, De Otio).', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-04-04 21:16:39', '2006-10-23 08:45:17', 'The Evergreen State College', NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

We can\'t think or act intelligently in relation to the world if we think statically. The main problem is that we think that things change, one-at-a-time in ways that can be readily foreseen when, in actuality, things are constantly in flux. Misunderstanding of possibilities, mob tendencies, privacy abuses, subject to manipulation and control.', 'This pattern addresses the need for exploring (with the hope of improving) Mobile Intelligence. It\'s intended for researchers, activists, citizens and for anybody who is trying to make sense of the world.', 'John Urry articulated the need to reconceptualize sociology in such a way to better understand and explore the \"mobilities\" of our era (2000). <i>Mobilities</i> characterize movement from one state to another in the broadest sense. A reconceptualization of social mobilities extends the core notion of people moving from one place to another, whether to fight &mdash; or escape from &mdash; a war, pursue economic opportunities that aren\'t available at home, visit family, attend college, make a religious pilgrimages, conduct business or visit resorts or museums as a tourist. Urry reminds us that people are not the only entities in the <i>social universe.</i> These new mobilities include the movement of commodities, raw materials, microbes, mobs and soccer hooligans, AK-47s and fissionable material, ideologies, tactics, criminal networks, social issues, social movements, money (legitimate and otherwise), brands, virtual communities, financial information, smuggled people, radioactivity, movies, pirated DVDs, pollution, oil, electricity, water, surveillance, terrorist cells, drugs, and credit card information. In addition to those mobilities social status of individuals and, even identity itself, can change through movement to a higher or lower economic class, becoming a citizen &mdash; or refugee &mdash; in another country, or undergoing a sex change or religious conversion. \r\n\r\nUrry points out that sociology places social interaction at is core and is therefore the proper intellectual home for these considerations. Yet sociology as it\'s currently construed was created at a certain point in <i>Western</i> history and it often presupposes notions like <i>structure</i> or <i>function</i> that belie the inherent complexity of social interactions, forces, etc. Its area of focus is like the old \"flat earth\" perspective where the areas outside the known territory are simply <i>terra incognito.</i>. Urry advocates a new type of sociology that extends the traditional sociological tenets to a new sociology that more accurately reflects today\'s realities. Specifically Urry adds, <i>networks</i> and <i>fluids</i> to the traditional idea of \"region\" (upon which \"metaphor\" the \"sociological concept of society is based\") as important exemplars to be added to the new mix of phenomena and artifacts that need to be considered when interpreting new social realities. Networks contain structure or what Urry calls \"scapes,\" the \"networks of machines, technologies, organizations, texts and actors that constitute various interconnected nodes,\" and \"flows\" which pass through the \"scapes.\" Fluids, unlike networks, don\'t move discretely from node to node along scapes but are \"heterogeneous, uneven mobilities of people, information, objects, money, images, and risks, that move chaotically across regions in strikingly faster and unpredictable shapes.\" \r\n\r\nSome of the patterns in this language are ambiguous and hazy and whose recommendations can be summarized with non-committal \"more research is needed\" statements. One may get the impression that \"more research\" is <i>always</i> needed &mdash; if you ask an academic. Given the fact that all knowledge is incomplete, it may seem impossible to avoid that \"last refuge\" of a scholar, who is seemingly unable to make recommendation, until, they claim, their new research &mdash; once funded &mdash; will certainly bring the results that would enable them to make recommendations. The \"Mobile Intelligence\" pattern is one of those (hopefully few) patterns that generally follow the line above. It will surely morph in future versions of the language, possibly by splitting into several patterns that exploit new opportunities &mdash; or confront new threats &mdash; that were undreamt of today. \r\n\r\nThe coverage of this pattern extends from the most abstract and theoretical to the nitty-gritty <i>street level.</i> It relates to <i>how we think and converse</i> in broad strokes, about social change, the environment, etc. when we take the time <i>outside</i> of other work, as well as our thoughts and action when we\'re <i>thrown-in</i> a situation (Heidegger, 1962). In an example of the latter, Mary Jordan (2006) reports on an emerging new type of Mobile Intelligence: <blockquote>\"Cell phones and text messaging are changing the way political mobilizations are conducted around the world. From Manila to Riyadh and Kathmandu protests once publicized on coffeehouse bulletin boards are now organized entirely through text-messaging networks that can reach vast numbers of people in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\nThe technology is also changing the organization and dynamics of protests, allowing leaders to control, virtually minute-by-minute, the movements of demonstrators, like military generals in the field. Using texts that communicate orders instantly, organizers can call for advances or retreats of waves of protesters.\"</blockquote> And in 2003, when US President George Bush on a visit to London was keeping as far from the public eye as he could, protesters set up a \"Chasing Bush\" system that encouraged people to announce their Bush-sightings via the SMS on their cell phones which would then be relayed to protesters who would hasten to the location. The \"Flash Mob\" concept, in which a \"spontaneous\" gathering of a large number of people at a rug store or hotel lobby has been orchestrated with the aid of fast and inexpensive access to mobile communications, provides a glimpse into the future as to the absurd and amusing possibilities that the new technology can bring. It\'s easy to see that mobile communications has its dark sides, a point that Howard Rheingold brings up in his aptly-titled book <i>Smart Mobs.</i> A mob consists of people who are operating wholly at the limbic level. While \"rationality\" and \"cool-headed reason\" may be flawed, over-rated, and mostly mythical as operating concepts, consider a world in which they were totally absent. \r\n\r\nNew technologies (such as GPS, cell phones, cell phones with GPS, RFID, \"smart cards\", bar codes, laptops, \"augmented reality\" (where commercial information can be broadcast to your goggles), wireless technologies like 802.11b, etc..) are changing and are likely to continue to change our urban settings in particular (which are already undergoing massive changes due to globalization and new patterns of human settlements). Alex Steffen on his <i>World Changing</i> web site quotes the following from the <i>Breaking the Game</i> conference (2006) both permeate urban spaces (changing their uses) and change the way we look at buildings and place (changing development).<blockquote> \"[A]n emerging group of artists [is] deploying sensors, hand-held electronics, and faster Internet connections are developing projects that actively intervene in the shaping and reshaping of public spaces in contemporary cities. They are integrating digital technology into buildings in order to make them adaptive and responsive to the flows of human activity and environmental forces... They are scanning the unseen electromagnetic spectrum that surrounds specific places, and turning these data into compelling audio/visual experiences that both heighten and change our perception... Using PDAs and portable laptops connected wirelessly to databases, some artists are creating alternative social maps, counter-histories and individually annotated narratives about local populations in specific neighborhoods... Still others are using mobile social software to coordinate large numbers of bodies for political action; or devising playful and imaginary spaces within the city.... We don\'t have to leave or disconnect from physical space in order to connect to digital spaces. Artists, architects, technologists, urban planners, and others are recombining the two, connecting individuals and groups together at a variety of scales and intensities.\" </blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt is an understatement to say that mobile communications represents a major historic shift from historical patterns of communications. The Internet (and other) information and communication technologies have helped usher in tremendous changes already, but these changes may represent just the tip of the iceberg. Mobile communication is fast and increasingly commonplace. It opens up whole new arenas of both thought and action. Like many new technologies, the opportunities for abuse are legion &mdash; and critics should not be cowed into submission by new digital salesmen and their cheerleaders in the media. Some of the dimensions by which to consider barriers, boundaries and opportunities include: accessibility (costs of producing/consuming, location, language, etc.); relative size and influence and the relationship configuration between information producer and consumer (one or few or many or mass to one or few or many or mass); privacy, regulation, and  control; motivation for use; and user demographics.   \r\n\r\nSociologists, historians and others are now realizing that social phenomena (like environmental phenomena) are inherently complex. This means that we can\'t really know with certainty what the effects of our actions will be. Although this has always been the case, the realization is only now getting some traction. Moreover, many people &mdash; if not most &mdash; still seem to deny its reality and think and act according to older paradigms. Accepting its reality does not mean of course that we don\'t know anything or that <i>anything can happen</i>, What is different now is the increased speed, reach, and influence of the mobility. Imagine a missile latching on to the frequency of a cell phone or myriad consequences of remote observation, sensing, and surveillance. On a larger scale, consider the vulnerability or volatility of a complex physical, social, or technological environment where critical limits or \"tipping points\" in many important areas are likely to be breached at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhile much of our time in the future will certainly be spent trying to repulse the efforts of people who will use (and attempt to use) Mobile Intelligence to increase their dominance over others, one of the main points of this pattern is to encourage the exploration of positive possibilities that the new technology opens up. One such area is in the realm of emergency communications. What difference could it make in a situation like the Chernobyl disaster or Hurricane Katrina? We could also gather data about dangerous conditions &mdash; speed of cars, air or water quality, radioactivity and other mobile phenomena.', 'We can think of Mobile Intelligence in at least three ways: (1) intelligence about a variety of mobilities; (2) intelligence that can be used in different situations (where the intelligence itself is mobile or \"portable\"); and, (3), mobile intelligence that moves us forward; in other words the intelligence <i>mobilizes</i> people. As researchers, activists and citizens, we can consciously ask about the \"mobility\" of our intelligences &mdash; and reconceptualize them as necessary.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-04-04 23:20:05', '2007-03-12 10:33:23', NULL, NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

An international cash transaction tax could help the global good by raising substantial funds to support the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations.  This tax also has the potential of stemming damaging speculative attacks on the currencies of middle-income developing countries aiding in their financial stability.  National transaction taxes have also been suggested to create even handedness and fairness by allowing the wealthy to carry the larger share of the tax burden.', 'The implementation of transaction taxes are seen as a way to broaden the tax base by the collection of tax on the voluntary exchange of money that is not currently taxed.  Primary examples of this are the purchase and sale of stocks, bonds, and foreign exchange transactions.  Transaction taxes have been proposed on both national and international levels for various reasons.', 'Many support the idea of an international currency transaction tax (ICTT) on voluntary currency transactions as an innovative financing tool to raise money for international development.  One of the most urgent local problems that needs to be addressed is starvation in the sub-Sahara region of Africa, though The United Nations has defined several areas of need around the world with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \"The MDG\'s are as follows: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and, develop a global partnership for development.\" (Spratt 2005)  The G8 have also pledged money for the achievement of the MDG\'s by the year 2015.  Whether the G8 money becomes a reality or not, there is still a huge need for funding to help implement these important goals.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a transaction tax has been around for a long time and was presented in London in 1936 by James Maynard Keynes.  However, a transaction tax is commonly known as a Tobin Tax, named after Nobel laureate James Tobin.  In 1970 James Tobin recommended the use of a transaction tax to discourage speculation in the foreign exchange (FX) market.  Reducing speculation has the expected result of lowering market volatility.  This volatility can be very damaging to developing countries when their currencies are unstable.  In this way the transaction tax has a second development function in bringing mid-income countries in line with underlying fundamentals that promote long term investment in their country. India has already implemented its own national transaction tax on securities trades as a means to simplify the tax regime and to reduce speculation in Indian financial markets.  \r\n\r\nEven in wealthier nations like the USA the idea of instituting a transaction tax is floated as a means to broaden the tax base, delete the marginal tax, and overhaul a complex tax system.  This type of national transaction tax allows the wealthy to carry a larger share of the tax burden based on their easy access to financial markets and the less fortunate to carry a smaller burden in relation to their lower income and assets.\r\n\r\nThere are many critics of the Tobin tax.  Some economists say the reduction of speculation also means the reduction of liquidity which can have its own damaging effects.  Other economists have produced studies to show that curbing speculation does not reduce currency volatility.  Often critics are those who would be most affected by paying the new tax and their criticisms generally reflect their desire for maximum self enrichment.  However, there are many around the world, including wealthy people who would be affected by the tax, that like the charitable development that could be funded by this type of financing.  \r\n\r\nNew technology and communications systems along with the internet make it possible to collect a transaction tax with efficiency and make avoidance extremely difficult.  Electronic technology of the bank clearing system already in place could be digitally fitted with a financial equivalent of the EZ pass that is now used to speed traffic through toll booths on highways.  International payment and collection systems like the CLS (continuously linked settlement) Bank already link automated domestic LVPS (large value payment systems) making the collection of a transaction tax a realistic idea.', 'By allowing a transaction tax at either a national or international level, disparities between the rich and poor can be mitigated to some degree.

In many cases, the highest or easiest profit aims at wants that may not ultimately be in the interests of the targetted consumers (let alone the workers or the environment).  For instance, many food companies focus on high fat, high sugar, high salt products that humans find tasty based on an evolutionary history in which these substances were difficult to find.  For people in the developed world, however, having access to such foods is unhealthy.  Furthermore, the way these foods are produced, transported and marketed involves unaccounted for costs to humanity.  This is just one example.  In general, corporations are not only motivated, but legally required to maximize profits, not meet actual human needs.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the economies of scale lead large companies to focus efforts on those wants that are best met by mass-produced goods and services.  There are a huge range of very specific needs that much smaller groups or individuals have which do not provide suffficient inducement for large companies to provide.\r\n\r\nThus, the corporately created world both fails to meet many human needs and even when it does produce value, it tends to focus on wants rather than needs and do so in a way that has many undesirable side-effects.', 'In a variety of arenas, including publishing scholarly work, the development of educational materials, and the development of useful, robust software, an \"open source\" process has shown itself to be very effective.  There are a variety of reasons why such a process is now timely.  First, there are a large number of people globally with access to the Internet.  This allows global communities with common interests to work together without the necessity of physical travel (which can be expensive in time and money).  Second, there are worked examples of people from many fields volunteering their efforts to create value for the common good of their community.  These examples serve, in turn, as models for other communities.  Third, there are a critical mass of people with time and knowledge to add value to such collective efforts.  Fourth, although it has been common in the past for those in power to use their power to keep their power, in modern times, a series of social and legal processes have been put in place to consolidate power into structures that are no longer effectively regulated by countervaling forces such as local governments or community pressure.  The first three factors make the use of Open Source feasible and the last makes it manditory.  In addition, Open Source has the capacity to personalize and customize value to much smaller groups than is feasible for large companies.  Thus, by offering Open Source materials, people may collectively fulfull a greater proportion of human needs and wants.  This is currently referred to as \"the long tail.\"  There are a very large number of people wanting a few common things and a very small number of people each wanting something different.  Open Source is much better positioned to fulfill those different things wanted by only a relatively few.', 'Perhaps the most articulate introduction to the general concept of open source is the introduction to Eric von Hippel\'s (2005) Democratizing Innovation: \r\n\r\n\"When I say that innovation is being democratized, I mean that users of products and services -- both firms and individual consumers -- are increasingly able to innovate for themselves.  User-centered innovation processes offer great advantages over the manufacturer-centric innovation development systems that have been the mainstay of commerce for hundres of years.  Users that innovate can develop exactly what they want, rather than relying on manufacturers to act as their (often very imperfact) agents.  Moreover, individual users do not have to develop everything they need on their own: they can benefit from innovations developed and freely shared by others.  The trend toward democractization of innovation applies to information products such as software and also to physical products.  As a quick illustration of the latter, consider the development of high-performance windsurfing techniques and equipment in Hawaii by an informal user group.\" \r\n\r\nProbably the most notable and widespread success story of \"open source\" is the development of open source software. The \"source code\" of any computer program is the complete set of instructions that the computer follows to provide its functions. There are two competing philosophies that determine the rules regarding the distribution of software \"source code.\" \r\n\r\nThe basic business orientation dictates that, above all, the source code should be kept private and that only people who are allowed to make changes to it -- either to add functionality or fix bugs -- are the people who are authorized by the company that owns it.  Although there are several variants, the \"free software\" or \"open source\" model if more-or-less the opposite of the corporation model in nearly all respects. Anybody can obtain the source code without cost.  Anybody can make changes to the source code.  And anybody can distribute the code without restriction to anybody.\r\n\r\nBesides its desirable price (nothing!), the open source model offers many advantages over the closed, corporate model.  One is that many eyes can identify and fix many bugs. Software flaws such as bugs or security holes are more readily found and exposed.  (This is the reason why fair voting advocates are generally in favor of open source voting software.) Another reason is that the open source model promotes innovation by allowing anybody to implement new functionality. Although many of the modifications may be unwanted,  some may provide a foundation for desirable features.  Although the open source approach has its own disadvantages (as do all approaches), it offers surprisingly stiff competition against deep-pocketed corporate behemoths.  Linux, for example, is more robust, less buggy and on a faster release cycle than well-funded corporately engineered operating systems.\r\n\r\nAlthough computer programmers have been at the forefront of this intellectual revolution, computer programs are certainly not the only complex artifacts that could be designed, built, maintained and improved through an open-source collective effort.\r\n\r\nOne obvious artifact to think about moving into open source development is the development of vaccines and other medicines.  And in this arena, medicines that could reduce suffering caused by the worldwide HIV-AIDS epidemic come to mind readily.  Of course, in so-called \"primitive\" societies, knowledge of how to find, prepare and use medicinal plants was a precious gift handed down from generation to generation. \r\n \r\nWith oil prices skyrocketing, open source automobile developers could work together on developing automobiles with super high mileage and other environmentally friendly features.  Already (NY Times August 2005) hobbyists are modifying Priuses and other hybrid vehicles to pump up the mileage.  (See \r\nRelated Patterns: \"Open Source Characters\", \"Open Source Scholarly Publications\" \"The Commons\" and \"Appropriation of Technology\"\r\n\r\nBecause corporations are driven primarily to maximize profits, they tend to focus efforts on the very popular and tend to ignore small niche interests.  For example, the open source music movement now allows individuals to create music collaboratively and globally.  Probably the most popular of these, adding 200 users per week is MacJams.  (See links below for general home page and to see what an individual\'s entry looks like).  Albums can be built and distributed on a one-off basis without the high up-front costs of using a recording studio.  \r\n\r\nSimilar avenues exists for poetry, stories, photographs, video and artwork.

Other possible participants include computer geeks, social activists, environmental activists and those wanting to learn more about computers and new technology.', 'The use of information and communication systems is expanding enormously in countries like the US as well as in countries like China and India. This is causing immense demands on their infrastructure and on the environment. Computer technology has grown increasingly more sophisticated in a very short period of time.  During that same time, the costs have dropped in relative and absolute terms, thus resulting in a massive number of obsolete computers and other technology much of which has been dumped somewhere where toxins like lead, cadmium and mercury can leach into the soil and water. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the new intellectual and social spaces that the new technology helps provide, we need to think about the impact that information and communication systems are having on the environment. Although we associate physical spaces like libraries and auditoriums with energy and resource use, the creation, storage, and distribution of information requires energy and resource use as well. Some of this use doesn\'t square with conventional wisdom. Computer use, for example was supposed to lower the consumption of paper because everybody would simply read the computer screen. The amount of travel was also going to decline because business could be conducted electronically, thus substituting communication for transportation. The electronics industry was also celebrated as an environmentally friendly industry yet there are 19 \"superfund\" sites associated with high-tech industries slated for environmental remediation in Santa Clara county, home to more of these sites that any other county in the U.S. IBM and Fairchild Electronics were disposing their waste products in underground tanks which subsequently leaked trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, Freon and other solvents into the drinking water of 65,000 people. There also seems to be an unhealthy link between the waste producers and the people who must deal with it, specifically prison inmates who work with inadequate protection and no health insurance working in <i>for profit</i> prisons. \r\n\r\nWhy pick on information and communication systems? After all, other sectors use energy and cause pollution. One reason is that \"electronic waste is the fastest growing part of the waster system,\" according to the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition.  Another reason is that it\'s important for people to realize that information and communication technology is <I>not</I> a utopian, magical answer to all problems. Obviously we need to consider the entire life-cycle of all products &mdash; including those related to information and communication. (While this task is not trivial, thinking about the \"second order\" effects while extremely important, is even more difficult to do meaningfully. The effects of the automobile on all aspects of life, including attitudes on sex, as well as the effects of the size of the weapons industry in the U.S. on foreign policy are both intriguing examples of unforeseen side-effects.) Understanding the entire \"cradle-to-grave\" (and <I>beyond!</I> as in the case of toxins that can reach out from the grave to poison air and water) is critical, but what should be done with the information? It may be easiest to require that every manufactured or imported product is covered under an ecologically-sound \"Take-it-Back\" (SVTC, 2005) policy that requires the manufacturer or importer to pay for recovery or safe sequestering of hazardous materials. \r\n\r\nFree Geek was started in Portland, Oregon in 2000 by members of the open source software community to bring resources to bear on the problems of e-waste and the digital divide by helping \"the needy get nerdy.\" The Free Geek approach combines participatory education and environmentalism. Free Geek addresses the problem of discarded computers and other electronic e-waste can be diminished by reusing and recycling. Free Geek uses volunteer labor to give new life to discarded technology. Volunteers are eligible to receive a computer after finishing a tour of service which educates the volunteer about computers and about the environmental impacts of ICT. The city government in Portland, as part of their effort to reduce e-waste helps support the project. A broad range of people are working together to cross the economic and social divides by working towards a common goal. The Free Geek concept has quickly spread to other areas including Washington, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois. \r\n\r\nThe Free Geek approach is not the only way to address the problem of lacking a community recycling program. There are many similar projects throughout the country that may or may not use open source software. But Free Geek is worth mentioning here for many reasons. First, Free Geek was developed by civil society; second, Free Geek is a partnership between several sectors and thus helps bring all sectors of the local community into a common struggle; and, third, Free Geek is an innovative approach that deftly addresses a multitude of issues within a common set of principles, assumptions and actions.  \r\n\r\nStarting and running a Free Geek or similar program requires a variety of skills and activities. The pattern can only be implemented by a group of people. To start that group one would post meeting announcements and invite members from local Linux users groups, college students and others. Since the overall environment for this approach will vary from community to community it\'s important to find out what\'s happening in your community and who\'s involved. The success of the project is likely to depend on how well you understand your community and can work with people in the community.  Beyond that, there are many \"nuts and bolts\" issues including finding space and funding and developing programs. Associating with Free Geek is probably a good idea because of its network of dedicated people, useful documents and software for running an community recycling project. \r\n\r\nThe environmental problems associated with information and communication technology are severe and no mutually agreed-upon long-term, sustainable solution has been identified. People are developing a variety of creative and thoughtful responses to the problems of ICT-related pollution but more  are needed. Information and communication technology can probably be part of the solution &mdash; but part of this involves stopping be part of the problem.', 'As a necessary part of stewardship and responsibility, it\'s essential to come to terms with the environmental impact of information and communication systems and devise suitable strategies towards minimizing their negative effects. Some combination of policy, consumer education, habits of consumption, social and technological innovation and recycling will probably be necessary for this take place effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"-1\" color=\"#303030\">Introductory graphic located at <a href=\"http://freegeek.org/volunteer.php\">http://freegeek.org/volunteer.php</a></font>', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-04-04 23:20:05', '2006-11-16 18:05:11', 'Free Geek Olympia', NULL, 'Public Sphere Project (CPSR)', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

If other countries and international organizations are impotent against such transgressions, NGOs and other civil society groups (who have even fewer resources) face almost insurmountable hurdles for legally challenging these actions.', 'Non-governmental organizations or other citizen groups with few to no means by which to challenge what they perceive to be moral wrongs are the main users of this pattern. Unfortunately the use of this pattern is limited generally to democratic societies or other places where its confrontational approach is tolerated. There are countries, for example, where a tribunal directed at the United States could be convened, while a tribunal directed against the government of the host country would be strictly prohibited. Unfortunately there are few, if any, public or legal means where citizens of countries like North Korea, Uzbekistan and other countries that are isolated from the network of international relations, can challenge their government\'s policy without fearing for their life and liberty.', 'Civil Society faced with what they perceive as serious crimes that are being perpetrated by governments, has devised the concept of a \"Citizen\'s Tribunal.\" Part legal proceedings, part theater, part publicly speaking \"truth to power\", the concept has been expressed most strongly with the World Tribunal on Iraq (WTI) condemning the invasion of Iraq by the United States. \r\n\r\nAccording to Richard Falk, professor emeritus from Princeton University, \"The WTI was loosely inspired by the Bertrand Russell tribunal held in Copenhagen and Stockholm in 1967 to protest the Vietnam War, which documented with extensive testimony the allegations of criminality associated with the American role in Vietnam. The Russell tribunal featured the participation of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and other notable European left intellectuals. It relied on international law and morality to condemn the war but made no pretension of being a legal body, and its jury contained no international law experts.\" The World Tribunal on Iraq had its specific roots in a session of the Permanent Tribunal of the People that was held before the war in Rome. The sessions of the WTI began in Brussels in March 2004 and finished in June 2005 in Istanbul. Sessions were also held in Berlin, Stockholm, Hiroshima, Rome, New York, and Barcelona. \r\n\r\nThe work of the WTI was divided into a <i>Panel of Advocates</i> and a <i>Jury of Conscience.</i> The role of the Panel of Advocates was to document the charges against George Bush, Tony Blair, and others through analysis and testimony. This body would then present the case to a Jury of Conscience which was \"composed of distinguished moral authority personalities from around the world, to pass judgment on the actors and their actions from the perspective of international law.\"\r\n\r\nOne question is how does the \"other side\" participate &mdash; if at all? Can they submit evidence or provide testimony? In other words, how does a tribunal differ from a trial? For one thing, the U.S., for example, the U.S. would undoubtedly skip a Citizen\'s Tribunal since it has declined to appear before the World Court as a defendant. A Citizen\'s Tribunal is not a <i>court</i> (it obviously has no powers of enforcement, for example) and is not obligated to emulate one. At least in the case of the WTI, a Citizen\'s Tribunal \"is self-consciously an organ of civil society, with its own potential enforcement by way of economic boycotts, civil disobedience and political campaigns.\" It is not designed to <i>find</i> the truth but to bring the truth to light.  As Falk points, out, the WTI as <i>an instrument of civil society:</i> \"proceeds from a presumption that the allegations of illegality and criminality are valid and that its job is to reinforce that conclusion as persuasively and vividly as possible.\r\n\r\nLegitimacy, however, as in the legal system, is a very big issue. If the tribunal does not seem legitimate, it can more easily be portrayed as a charade. Legitimacy can be maximized by providing unimpeachable authorities and by providing strong corroborating evidence including documentation and expert testimony. \r\n\r\nAs a direct and public challenge to power and authority the Citizen\'s Tribunal faces numerous challenges in addition to difficult task of establishing legitimacy. One of the most important of these challenges is irrelevance. The unequivocal repudiation of the powers-that-be is unlikely to be covered in any serious way by the media. Additionally, the possibly marginal nature of the group sponsoring a Citizen\'s Tribunal places it far from the centers of power and is thus questioned about the legitimacy of its actions. \r\n\r\nSince the power of a Citizen\'s Tribunal relies on its symbolic nature, publicity is important. One approach is to bring in a broad coalition to organize the Tribunal. It is important to get people to the event and to send out publicity afterwards (through, for example, the web and DVDs). The WTI submitted its report to the United Nations.  On the other hand, exposure and publicity can be risky &mdash; counter demonstrations, arrests, intimidation and thuggery, in addition to media condemnation, might be in store for the conveners. \r\n\r\nMany challenges present themselves while organizing and conducting the event: Who will participate? How is the agenda organized? Where will the funding come from? How will security issues be handled?  And of course, the idea of multiple venues, however attractive the idea is, increases the magnitude of the logistical challenges considerably. \r\n\r\nAlthough Falk\'s statement below (from a WTI press release) is associated with the World Tribunal on Iraq, the basic approach and philosophy of that effort can serve as a basic model (that can be modified) for another tool for people without extensive resources who are struggling with issues of state violence and other urgent issues of our times. <blockquote>\"The WTI is opposing aggressive war, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. It is not opposing the governments or the United Nations. Indeed it hopes to create pressure from below that will encourage law-abiding governments and the UN to do their proper job of protecting weaker countries and their populations against such illegalities. And beyond this protection we are promoting a world movement of peoples and governments to realize a humane form of globalization that is equitable with respect to the world economy, legitimate in upholding the human rights of all, and dedicated above all else to creating the conditions for sustainable peace based on justice for every nation on earth.\"</blockquote>', 'In certain situations, civil society organizations are moved to protest perceived crimes of sovereign nations.

(670, 650, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'In an era when international cooperation is critical (for national, regional, and global security, environmental protection, trade and investment, human rights, tourism, communications, maritime and aerial safety, criminal law enforcement among many issues) no overall reliable system of global governance is in place that enjoys universal respect, and satisfies concerns about accountability of leaders, participation of peoples and their representatives, and transparency of the regulatory process itself. It is no longer suitable to rely on a traditional form of world order based upon the anarchic interplay of sovereign states pursuing their particular short-term interests, with the leading state or states assuming a managerial role for the entire system. Particularly disturbing is the persisting tendency of political leaders to consider resort to war as their fundamental instrument for the resolution of international conflict, and to divert vast resources to the preparation for war. Unfortunately, many governments, including those with the greatest power, mistakenly continuing to believe that their country will be better off pursuing national security interests without being constrained by the limits set by international law governing the use of force', 'It is important not to overstate the role and contributions of international law. In the past, for instance, international law was used to lend an appearance of legality to colonialism and aggressive war, as well as to serve the interests of oppressive governments who engaged in abuses of their populations behind a screen of impunity, being shield by the law that upheld the territorial supremacy of sovereign states. It remains the case that international law, and the governments and institutions that are supposed to implement its rules, are rarely able to save a people from oppressive rule or even genocidal behavior. Sovereignty provides states with the legal basis for committing human wrongs behind the walls of national boundaries. The rise of human rights, and claims of humanitarian intervention have challenged this moral and political failure to view abuses <i>within</i> states as being as much of a world order challenge as wrongdoing <i>between</i> states.\r\n\r\nInternational law is relevant in many different settings that reflect the extraordinary diversity of transnational activity in the contemporary world. Legal professionals- lawyers- represent governments, corporations, banks, international institutions- to facilitate their activities, both by acting within the limits set by regulations contained in international law, and by altering legal standards to the extent helpful for more orderly conduct of affairs. Ordinary citizens, NGOs, and international civil servants all invoke international law to influence policy debates on a variety of global issues. International law is an important means for communicating claims and grievances, and provides insight into whether particular demands are reasonable or not.\r\n\r\nThe viability of international law has been recently drawn into serious question by the American response to the 9/11 attacks.  It has been claimed that the nature of international terrorism combined with potential access to weaponry of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, makes it unreasonable for states to wait to be attacked. The United States Government relied on such reasoning to justify its invasion of Iraq in 2003, which was widely regarded by international law specialists and world public opinion as a flagrant violation of both the UN Charter and international law. It is important both to acknowledge some pressures to interpret more flexibly the rules of international law governing the use of force and to reaffirm the importance of respecting these rules and the authority of the UN Security Council in relation to recourse to war. Reasonable adjustments of international law to changing circumstances of threat and danger can be accommodated, but not violations that defy the underlying basis of restricting reliance on force to genuine <i>defensive</i> security needs. In this regard, the restraints of international law are the work of realist diplomats and leaders, not the visions of utopian intellectuals far removed from the practical urgencies of international political life. International law is partly motivated by considerations of mutual convenience (e.g. the immunity of ambassadors, safety signals at sea) and partly reflective of the accumulated wisdom of seasoned statesmen.', 'From the perspective of the United States, the country that is most responsible for establishing the legal framework governing war after World War II and also the main challenger in light of recent global developments, the resolution of this debate about whether to limit foreign policy by reference to international law is of the greatest importance. It should be noted that the two greatest failures in American foreign policy in the last fifty years have resulted from  the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. These failures would not have occurred if American policy had been self-limited by reference to international law. It is a general fallacy to suppose that in the twenty-first century a powerful country is better off if it is not restricted in its policy options by law. The evidence suggests that the restrictions contained in international law reflect the encoded wisdom of several centuries of statecraft. The narrowing of the availability of war by international law over the course of the last century is an acknowledgement, in large part, of the growing dysfunctionality of war as instrument for the resolution of conflict.  \r\nIt is not only war and uses of force that needs to be regulated effectively by international law, but it is also necessary for advancing the human security of peoples throughout the world being afflicted by disease, poverty, environmental degradation, oppressive governance. Respect for law and international institutions encourages cooperative problem-solving that is increasingly necessary given the realities of globalization. In this regard, it is necessary to adapt the law-making procedures of the world to the significant roles being played by a variety of non-state actors, including market forces, regional organization, and civil society organizations. Whether incorporating this globalizing agenda and these non-state actors is achieved by an enlarged conception of international law, or by a transition in legal conceptualizing that adopts the terminology of global law is less important than the realization that the law dimension of world order is of critical importance in the struggle to achieve a less violent, more equitable, and more sustainable future for the whole of humanity.\r\n\r\nIn any current discussion of the future of international law, the role of the United States is crucial, and deserves major attention. This emphasis is not intended to be an Amnerican extension of Eurocentric world order that had dominated the globe for several centuries. It does reflect the importance of the United States as the richest and most powerful political actor in the world, a country that has often in the past taken the lead in championing a law-oriented approach to global security and more recently has seemed to encourage disregard of international law and world public opinion. Understanding both sides of this American relationship to international law helps situate any assessment as to future prospects.\r\n\r\nInternational law is basically concerned with regulating relations among sovereign states. The great struggle of the last hundred years has been to bring international law to bear on war. The United Nations Charter drafted in the aftermath of World War II promises to The prospects for  strengthening international law has two important current centers of gravity: (1) the unresolved debate in the United States as to whether to pursue security within a framework that respects international law and the authority of the United Nations. The learning experience associated with the failure of the Iraq policy needs to be converted into a renewed appreciation that reliance on military dominance and discretionary wars is dysfunctional at this stage of history, and that a voluntary respect for international law would simultaneously serve the national and global interest.\r\nThe resolution of this debate is of great importance to Americans and the world because of the leadership role that the United States plays on the global stage. The evidence supports the view that American global leadership will only recover its claims of legitimacy if it is able to revive its earlier enthusiasm for promoting the rule of law in world politics.\r\n(2) This specific debate, heightened in intensity after 9/11, hides an underlying set of issues associated with achieving a more effective and equitable approach to global governance in light of a series of world order challenges that have been generated by \r\nsuch problems as global warming, an imminent energy squeeze, mass migrations, and an array of self-determination struggles. At present, contradictory trends are undermining efforts to fashion a humane approach to these challenges. On the one side, globalization in all its forms is rendering the boundaries of states increasingly irrelevant to the patterning of many substantive concerns, while at the same time border controls are growing more harsh and walls are being created to fence some people in and others out.\r\nIt requires a new set of international legal initiatives, ambitiously conceived, to address these problems in a manner that does not produce chaos, oppressive violence, and ecological collapse. It is no longer acceptable to consider that world order can be entrusted to sovereign states pursuing their short-term interests. Protecting the future for the peoples of the world presupposes an ethos of responsibility, which in turn rests on the willingness to replace traditions of unilateralism and coercion with improved procedures of cooperation and persuasion. It is here that the past and future of international law offers hope to humanity provided the turn away from law can be reversed. \r\n\r\nThe growing fragility and complexity of international life provides a fundamental argument for strengthening international law, and for moving toward the establishment of global law that is able to regulate for the common good activities of market forces, regional organizations, international institutions, civil society actors, as well as the behavior of states. With a growing prospect of an energy squeeze requiring a momentous shift to a post-petroleum world society, the strains on regulatory regimes will be immense. Trust in and respect for international law will encourage approaches that are more likely to be fair and effective than the sort of chaos and resentments that will follow if relative power and wealth are relied upon to shift the main burdens of adjustment to the weak and poor.', 'The lessons of failed wars over the course of recent decades needs to be converted into a  sophisticated appreciation that reliance on military superiority and discretionary recourse to wars has become increasingly dysfunctional at this stage of history, and extremely wasteful with respect to vital resources needed to achieve other essential human goals, including the reduction of poverty, disease, and crime. Protecting the future for the peoples of the world presupposes as ethos of responsibility, which in turn rests on the willingness by both the powerful and the disempowered to replace whenever possible, coercion with persuasion, and to rely much more on cooperative and nonviolent means to achieve order and change. Law is centrally important in providing guidelines and procedures for moving toward a less violent, more equitable, and more sustainable future for the whole of humanity. With the rise of non-state actors (market and civil society actors; international institutions of regional and global scope) there is underway a necessary transition from an era of <i>international</i> law to an epoch of <i>global</i> law. It will be beneficial for the citizens and governments of the world to encourage this transition.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2005-04-04 23:20:05', '2006-07-21 23:59:15', NULL, NULL, 'Prof. Emeritus Int.

Unfortunately for them, corporate marketeers, government security forces and criminals, both amateur and professional, are working hard to uncover and exploit these secrets. While it\'s clear that some information of this sort needs to be uncovered for the common good (news of an impending terrorist attack, for example), this need is sometimes invoked as a pretext for trampling on privacy protections. Without adequate safeguards, dictators and other authoritarians (including many in putatively democratic societies) spy on critics of their regimes, an activity that can result in harassment or even torture or death of the critics in many places around the world.', 'Legitimate governments, civil society, and concerned individuals must work together to prevent the all-too-common privacy abuses where the powerful prey upon the less powerful. In what the Kinks call \"the wonderful world of technology\" the basic ingredients including massive amounts of personal information in digital form, ubiquitous communication networks and inexpensive and miniscule surveillance devices, coupled with the social equation of eager snoops and unsuspecting dupes, has helped create an explosion of privacy abuses and the potential for untold others. The fact that human <i>identities</i> themselves are now routinely \"stolen\" reveals the severity of the threat and how much \"progress\" is being made in the advancement of privacy abuse.', 'In 1763, the noted English Parliamentarian William Pitt in his \"Speech on the Excise Tax\" declared that \"The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the force of the Crown. It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storms may enter; the rain may enter  but the King of England cannot enter; all his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.\"\r\n\r\nNow nearly 250 years after Pitt\'s speech modern day rulers use technology to easily enter the tenements, both ruined and intact, of millions of people without a warrant or the problems associated with actual physical entrance. In the campaign to re-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger to the governor\'s office in California, according to Michael Blood (2006), \"The Schwarzenegger campaign has stockpiled millions of names, phone numbers and addresses with consumer preferences, voting histories and other demographic information.\" Then, based on assumptions about consumer preferences (a Democrat, for example, is more likely to drive a hybrid vehicle, while a Republican is more likely to drive a pickup truck or Cadillac), they employed \"microtargeting\" to carefully craft messages to appeal to the people they believe they now understand based on their interpretation of the data. According to Blood, \"The idea is an outgrowth of techniques that businesses have long used to find new customers. ... Few people might realize how much information is publicly available, for a price, about their lifestyles. Companies collect and sell consumer information they buy from credit card companies, airlines and retailers of every stripe.\" \r\n\r\nWhy is technology so crucial &mdash; and so threatening right now?  The quick answer is plenty of product and buyers. The laundry list of new technology is growing daily and institutions are not afraid to (ab)use it. Some, if not most, of the technology is plagued by problems that are either \"built-in\" (or otherwise inherent or inevitable) to the technology and/or subject to misuse. \"Face recognition\" software, at least currently, falls into the first category. John Graham, for example, of the Giraffe Project, faced a problem in the second category when his name showed up on the U.S. \"No fly list\" for no discernible reason. After several letters to the government he finally received word that his \"identity has been verified,\" meaning, presumably that yes <i>he</i> is the \"John Graham\" in question. Currently his name has not been removed from the list, whether this is attributable to incompetence, work overload, or basic mean-spiritedness is not easily determined. \r\n\r\nAccording to Privacy International, <blockquote>\"Privacy is a fundamental human right. It underpins human dignity and other values such as freedom of association and freedom of speech. It has become one of the most important human rights of the modern age.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is recognized around the world in diverse regions and cultures. It is protected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and in many other international and regional human rights treaties. Nearly every country in the world includes a right of privacy in its constitution. At a minimum, these provisions include rights of inviolability of the home and secrecy of communications. Most recently written constitutions include specific rights to access and control one\'s personal information. In many of the countries where privacy is not explicitly recognized in the constitution, the courts have found that right in other provisions. In many countries, international agreements that recognize privacy rights such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights have been adopted into law.\" </blockquote>The organization also points out that \"The recognition of privacy is deeply rooted in history. There is recognition of privacy in the Qur\'an and in the sayings of Mohammed. The Bible has numerous references to privacy. Jewish law has long recognized the concept of being free from being watched. There were also protections in classical Greece and ancient China.\r\n\r\nAlthough privacy is seen as a fundamental and universal right, it\'s not easily to define. For one thing, it does depend to some degree on culture and context. New communication technology as well as new surveillance technology has shown also that privacy &mdash; and the threats to it &mdash; also change over time. Generally speaking, \"privacy protection is frequently seen as a way of drawing the line at how far society can intrude into a person\'s affairs\" (Privacy International, ____). United States Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis explained privacy simply as the individual\'s \"right to be left alone.\" \r\n\r\nPrivacy can be divided into the following separate but related concepts (Privacy International, 2006): <blockquote><b>Information privacy,</b> which involves the establishment of rules governing the collection and handling of personal data such as credit information, and medical and government records. It is also known as \"data protection\";\r\n<b>Bodily privacy,</b> which concerns the protection of people\'s physical selves against invasive procedures such as genetic tests, drug testing and cavity searches;\r\n<b>Privacy of communications,</b> which covers the security and privacy of mail, telephones, e-mail and other forms of communication; and\r\n<b>Territorial privacy,</b> which concerns the setting of limits on intrusion into the domestic and other environments such as the workplace or public space. This includes searches, video surveillance and ID checks. </blockquote> Each of the types of privacy concept mentioned above has a variety of ways in which the privacy can be abused or invaded. What can be done to stop or slow down these abuses? <i>You can spy on some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time.  You can\'t spy on all of the people all of the time   yet.</i>\r\n\r\nThe ultimate aim is self-restraint where government and other groups and institutions that have a propensity o invade privacy stop doing it.  Whether apocryphal or not, there was a feeling that \"Gentlemen don\'t read other people\'s mail.\" Although it\'s not always obvious, there are always (presumably) limits to what people or institutions do that are either self-imposed by habit or by fear of retribution or other penalties. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it\'s not the case that people should just trust governments or businesses or other people or institutions who might feel obliged to invade your privacy. What can individuals do to protect their rights?  And what can individuals do to get out from problems where privacy has already been <i>invaded?</i> As individuals and as members of organizations (like the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Privacy Information Center, and Privacy Rights International) who stand up for privacy rights we must  anticipate abuses, monitor powerful (and otherwise snoopy), develop policy, negotiate and engage with authorities (law enforcement, legislators), redress abuses. There are many ways in which people can &mdash; and should &mdash; take personal initiative. These include encrypting e-mail, shredding, protecting yourself from identity theft; and, generally, falling for scams. Initiating lawsuits against the government and corporations for breaches in privacy can be an effective tool of the citizenry in behalf of privacy although ideally it would be much preferred if these institutions could be counted on to police themselves adequately.\r\n\r\nThe idea that \"an innocent person has nothing to fear\" is an illusion. Worse, it shows a lack of knowledge that is almost breathtaking. If privacy is the \"right to be left alone\" then different people will have draw different boundary lines &mdash; but everybody will draw one. On the other side of that boundary are institutions and people who will <i>cross that line</i> if they are emboldened to do so. There are also of course times when government or police are legitimately obligated to cross that line, but they will need to do so in a manner that is legitimate for the times. <i>There is never a time when there is no line.</i>  Thus privacy is important to everybody in the world.  It is also an important policy to consider for groups of people as well.  When, for example, would it be necessary to forcefully bring a small group that existed communally for centuries into a cash economy. When is it ethically acceptable to bring the \"word of god\" (one of them at least) to people of another religion?  When does one bomb a country to bring the benefits of democracy to it? \r\n\r\nWe\'d like to think that people would not have to resort to extraordinary measures to protect themselves from privacy intrusion and invasion After all, in the \"best of all possible worlds\" people wouldn\'t bother about privacy. Fortunately we don\'t live in the best of all possible worlds. There is ample evidence  in fact that the assault on privacy has only just begun. There are a number of  problems that are simply \"waiting to happen\" Google, for example, owns an immense amount of information about virtually everybody who has ever searched for anything online. While it may be true that, as their mission statement states, they\'ll \"do no evil,\" how can we be sure about the company in five or ten years time. And just as spammers keep finding way to send electronic dreck, the unethical collection of personal information may be done by new types of spybots, which could be part of e-blackmail rackets, possibly in conjunction with faked digital evidence. Although some people have less reason to fear government, business or criminal impinging on their privacy we all face problems, real and potential of abuse. For that reason privacy rights are often strongly associated with human rights, for example. Privacy is not just an issue for dissidents or political activists.', 'We are all living in an era when new technology and security concerns &mdash; both genuine and feigned &mdash; raise tremendous threats to privacy.

Our ultimate destination was Caracas, Venezuela, one of the three locations of the \"polycentric\" World Social Forum in 2006, but we visited Barquisemeto and the small hillside village of Sanare. Our tour was conducted by <i>Global Exchange,</i> a non-profit organization located in California,  that leads \"Reality Tours\" to nearly 30 countries including Afghanistan, China, Ireland, Mexico, India, Iran, the Mexican-US border, and Cuba. We visited a number of community centers, health clinics, educational missions, agricultural cooperatives, and housing developments set up by the Ch&aacute;vez government. Also, during the bus drive from Barquisemeto to Caracas our guide briefed us about recent Venezuelan history from the point of view of Ch&aacute;vez supporters as well as detractors. <i>Global Exchange</i>set up numerous presentations including one from an economics professor (with opposition leanings) who explained some of the particularities of the Venezuelan economy. We also had ample opportunities to converse with people at the forum.\r\n\r\nActivist road trips can provide more meaning than standard, non-activist, road trips. But how is the pattern employed? At a basic level, people can simply go on an activist road trip. This means pursuing activist activities &mdash; especially learning &mdash; while \"on the road.\" The preferred mode of transportation is by foot, bicycle, or car; possibly by bus or train; and probably not  by airplane where unscheduled stops and flexible timetables aren\'t allowed. This is not to suggest that the trip should be haphazard or random &mdash; just that serendipity is likely to come into play (and chance favors the prepared mind). Thinking about the trip ahead of time, planning for it, arranging to meet with various people and organizations in advance is very useful &mdash; just don\'t over schedule or otherwise become slave to your plan. A simple way to \"ground\" the trip is to attend events at the destination and at points along the way. Events could include anything from a mass rally to a simple breakfast with friends of friends. And don\'t forget to record your impressions during the trip and debrief and discuss upon your return. \r\n\r\nPeople can always elect to go on an Activist Road Trip but the concept itself must be <i>institutionalized</i> to make it easier for people in general to go on these trips and, ideally, to build active networks of people who are interested in similar issues. As with other patterns we concentrate on how to promote this incrementally, with little pieces that organically build towards larger networks or assemblies, rather than through a grand, top-down, plan. Therefore we must build upon the basic components: physical locations, activists (hosts, guest, and guides), information and means of getting from one place to the next. Many pieces of this pattern now exist. When, for example, punk rock aficionados, travel they often share information with each other  whos cool in the next town, whose couch is available, etc. This worksat least to some degree for the punk community, but what if a non-punk (like me?) wants to meet with some punks or if a punk wants to find out more about a non-punk group?\r\n\r\nThe chore is to help promote processes and ideas to build a thriving alternative to existing approaches to travel that are disconnected and disengaged. Ideally each visit helps to build the network while advancing positive social change. How can the network promote people from different communities getting together? Some of the pieces that we can envision include integrated calendar of events and atlases specifically designed for this type of trip. These atlases would necessarily be dynamic &mdash; events as well as the non-profits, infoshops and other host organizations &mdash; are often short-lived. \r\n\r\nOf course the above discussion suggests that the point of the road trip is to visit activist sites along the way.  Another approach is going on a road trip <i>as activists.</i> The <i>Bee Hive Collective</i> that travels throughout Latin American and develops intricate and beautiful murals that illustrate indigenous issues and struggles, and the <i>Miss Rockaway Armada</i> that traveled down the Mississippi River in the summer of 2006 to share art, music, environmentalism and an anarchist perspective with everyone they met, are great examples of this. In both of those cases, the groups essentially brought their activism with them. The ultimate activist road trip in the U.S. would have to be the Freedom Rides in the spring of 1961 where activists traveling on buses from Washington, DC to various towns and cities in the deep South to publicize their fight for civil rights were met with racist violence that was only quelled after federal intervention. \r\n\r\nA person implementing this pattern should expect a number of challenges. For example, people working in one activist destination could be overwhelmed by large numbers of people passing through. It is incumbent on the traveler to make sure that the host is not taken advantage of. Visitors must be sensitive to their host\'s situation and aware of their responsibilities as guests. Encounters between visitor and host, important as they are, have several potential complications. Who knows that the field trip to, say, a worker\'s collective is not to a \"Potemkin village\" that has been carefully \"staged\" in order to convey certain impressions to the guests, perhaps in a bid for funding. And how do we ensure that the visitors to a favella in Rio De Janeiro, a township in Capetown, or to the South Bronx, are not simply treating what they\'re witnessing as a spectacle. \r\n\r\nThe possibility exists that when any destination is made public, in an atlas, for example, hostile townspeople might choose to harass the travelers or the host. There could also be other types of vexing side-effects. If, for example, people in the hosting situation were serving food to visitors, the local health department could decide to pay a call on an illegal dining establishment. Also, the network is built on social relationships and the ones encountered in an Activist Road Trip are more likely to be dynamic than more established venues.  \r\n\r\nThere are dozens of  possible places to visit on an Activist Road Trip: activist organizations, collectives, shelters, migrant camps, small businesses, reservations, encampments, sanctuaries, labor halls, organic farms, conferences, concerts, environmental disasters, prisons, community media centers, barrios, refugee camps, etc. Ideally the travelers could stop at \"World Citizen Travel Bureaus\" along the way or at \"People\'s Embassies\" or, even a \"Museum of Civil Society\" &mdash; if people create them! \r\n\r\nAnd People can add an Activist Road Trip to another trip. Rather than fly in to their destination, dropping in out of the sky as it were, people could explore the region en route to, or returning from, the event to observe first hand the realities that the forum examines. This can even be done <I>within</I> the city itself. One doesn\'t have to travel very far &mdash; physically &mdash; to find unexplored regions. The Activist Road Trip can be done in your own region or city. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The photo above is from <a href=\"http://www.missrockawayarmada.org/\">The Miss Rockaway Armada</a> web site.

There are also organizations and other institutions that violate the public trust or who otherwise wield illegitimate power. Unfortunately these two types often overlap. Some wield enormous power while some are impotent and irrelevant. At any rate, both types must be monitored closely &mdash; persistently and non-superficially &mdash; to encourage them to exert their powers appropriately. Moreover, both of these groups (and, indeed, all of us) are faced with millions (basically <i>uncountable</i>) of problems (and problems in the making) within the environment that are not well understood within a useful framework. The institutions that civil society establishes are often too diffuse or too narrow to face these problems effectively, while many seem to be \"reinventing the wheel.\" Institutions of government and business can be too powerful or politically beholden to perform their duties responsibly; they can also be conceptually or administratively misaligned with their mission for many reasons.', 'There are many sets of problems / situations / contexts that can be addressed with the same pattern. \"Institutions\" in the sense of people who are organized around certain goals in a persistent way are ubiquitous.', 'The world of mirrors &mdash; and, hence, any discussion of them in a metaphorical way &mdash; leads to reflections and reflections of reflections and reflections of reflections of reflections and so on. <i>So be it. </i> \r\n\r\nMirrors reflect, but not perfectly. At the very least they reverse the image that they\'re reflecting. We\'re only using mirrors, however, as a metaphor for reflection or replication. \r\n\r\nDue to the size and complexity of most of these mirroring endeavors, formal or informal organizations are established to tackle the job. For many reasons organizations that mirror to some degree the area within the overall environment that they are focused on are likely to have more success than those who don\'t. An institution is society\'s attempt to make a \"machine\" whose output is of a desired type. It reflects (however imperfectly) the desires of its creators and maintainers and its \"products\" are \"mirror images\" of each other (or at least have the same \"family resemblance.\") \"Mirror Institutions\" are those institutions that <i>reflect</i> or <i>reflect upon</i> other institutions or other realities. As such this pattern covers a very wide range. To cover this wide range we\'ve identified four important facets: the reflective mirror institution, the critical mirror institution, the alternative / generative mirror institution, and the flattering mirror institution. The boundaries between these different institutional mirror types aren\'t clear. It\'s hard in other words, to know where one ends and another begins. And the \"mirror\" itself (at least the metaphorical mirror we\'re talking about) is a constructed object whose object is implicitly or explicitly what it\'s set up to be and what it has come to be (while realizing, of course, that the characteristics are not completely knowable either but are subject to interpretation themselves &mdash; <i>via another mirror.</i> And, like all mirrors, the reflections can be seen from many angles.\r\n\r\n<b>The reflective mirror institution </b> is used to help us understand without bias some aspects of the \"real world.\" This institution needs to reflect the most salient aspects of its object back to the people who need to understand the object. Scientists ideally employ this type of mirror institution when they endeavor to understand the complex and intricate relationships within the physical environment. \r\n\r\nJames A. Wilson in his essay \"Matching Social and Ecological Systems in Complex Ocean Fisheries\" states that the \"mismatch of ecological and management scale makes it difficult to address the fine-scale aspects of ocean ecosystems, and leads to fishing rights and strategies that tend to erode the underlying structure of populations and the system itself.\" He goes on to state that \"This is likely to be achieved by multiscale institutions whose organization <i>mirrors</i> the spatial organization of the ecosystem and whose communications occur through a polycentric network.\"\r\n\r\nProblems can result arise if people believe that they\'re using a reflection that has perfect fidelity or if they\'re work is overly influenced by ideology.\r\n\r\n<b>The critical mirror institution </b> is used to uncover, analyze and expose the failings of another institution. Using the explicit philosophy, goals, and practices of the institution itself to show the stark contrast between their often noble rhetoric and what they\'re actually doing is a common approach. In the U.S., for example, the OMB Watch organization performs a \"watchdog\" function on the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within the U.S. government. The Bretton Woods project uses the decisions made by global economic powers at the 19__ Bretton Woods meeting as the basis for its critique of international capital and its institutional handmaidens. \r\n\r\n<b>The alternative / generative mirror institution </b> is used to develop &mdash; and propagate &mdash; alternatives to existing institutions. Governments in exile are one use of this pattern, as are community banks, whether they\'re in Venezuela or other countries. Sometimes the alternative is then mirrored into multiple versions of itself. Federated institutions that are <i>loosely</i> connected to each other and more-or-less the same type of species represent a good way to develop strength globally while maintaining local control. This was used in the realm of independent, non-commercial communication, including community access television, community networks and the Independent Media Centers movements. \r\n\r\nThe World Social Forum is a blend of two mirror institution facets: the critical and the alternative / generative; it established itself as a counter-forum to the World Economic Forum which promotes alternative ideas and visions. The World Social Forum is also being mirrored in the form of regional and thematic forums. \r\n\r\n<b>The flattering mirror institution </b> is an existing mirror, sometimes called an infinite mirror that is self-referential, often self-indulgent, self-deceiving, self-reinforcing, and sycophantic. That is, to a large degree, the state of the media today, endlessly reflecting upon itself like an echo chamber. \r\n\r\n[Note that media reflects society &mdash; however incompletely &mdash; back to itself. As Israeli journalist Gideon Levy of the Haaretz newspaper pointed out \"The Palestinians know what the Israelis are doing.\"]\r\n\r\nThere are several ways by which to look at any mirror institutions &mdash; especially when setting one up. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object or environment &mdash; <i>What</i> is standing in front of the mirror?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reflection &mdash; <i>What</i> is being reflected?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on the reflection &mdash; <i>What</i> are you seeing in the reflection? Should you be looking for other things?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience &mdash; <i>Who</i> is (or should be) peering into the mirror institution?\r\n\r\nDoes relying exclusively on \"reflections\" mean that wholly new institutions can\'t be devised? Although brand new institutions can be created through a series of partial changes, this argues for more of an intelligent (or pragmatic, efficient or opportunistic) design, rather than creation. Decentralized Intelligence Agency?!\r\n\r\nChallenges: Adopting and realigning when necessary. Maintaining a network with like-minded organizations &mdash; mirror or not. The \"mirror\" approach is <i>ecological</i> &mdash; but who\'s doing the \"higher level\" work?? Governments exists to (or should exist to) sort out (or at least assist with the sorting out process) issues related to rights and responsibilities &mdash; who (and what) can do something and who (and what) <i>should</i> do something. Associated with this is the task of developing (and exercising) incentives to encourage people to do the right thing and penalties for those who don\'t.\r\n\r\nThis is a pattern for <i>conscious adaptation.</i> A pattern transformation, since culture is propagated by its institutions. This is very much an analogy to basic evolutionary theory. Mirroring implies copying -- but generally copying with changes made to one or more aspects of the original in the process. <i>Liberating Voices is a mirror of A Pattern Language.</i>', 'Although this pattern is  may be a bit heavy on abstractions, we believe that the institution-as-mirror metaphor can be very useful primarily due to the questions it brings to the surface.

It\'s sole basis is economic growth, with the majority of profits funneled to already rich industrialized nations.

The hallmark of Engaged Tourism is that it is community-determined, sustainable and draws on the existing resources (people-centered & environmental) of the community.', 'The challenges to participating in responsible tourism are many.  A westerner\'s perception of travel and vacationing are already formed to expect a certain kind of product.  Swimming pools, air-conditioning, lavish meals, subservient staff, \"staged\" traditional activities and the like leave little room for discovering the many wonders of foreign cultures or experiencing the complexities of a different lifestyle.  Foreign governments share in the global race to classify tourism as a national export, paving the way for multinational corporations to build a tourist infrastructure at the expense of whatever may be in its way.  \r\n\r\nTourism Concern, an NGO based in the United Kingdom is a primary source of information about the social, environmental, and economic impacts of tourism at the same time that it advocates and provides information about alternatives.  According to Tourism Concerns web site, some of the main negative effects of tourism include displacement of people (particularly native peoples living on their traditional lands), environmental damage from uncontrolled development, and water abuse. In examining water abuse its easy to find that \r\nthe presence of tourists naturally means a much higher demand for water. Local communities normally do not benefit, and in most cases, are not allowed access to infrastructure built to ensure safe drinking water. The development of golf courses and hotel swimming pools are responsible for depleting and contaminating water sources for surrounding communities; this is especially true in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. An average 18-hole golf course soaks up at least 525,000 gallons of water a day - enough to supply the irrigation needs of 100 Malaysian farmers.\r\n\r\nEquations, an East Indian NGO promoting responsible tourism, documents several tourism projects that are moving ahead without local support.  The mega Bekal Tourism Project plans to convert Bekal, a northern rural coastal fishing district, into Asias largest beach tourism resort of 6500 units by 2011.  As a consequence, four entire fishing communities would be destroyed, communities that are among the most sustainable in all of India. In addition, unique cultural practices are at risk.  \r\nThe indigenous fishing community of Kasaragod is the last remaining community along the Keralam coast with traditional fishing techniques. They abhor over fishing and adhere to sustainable harvesting practice. The community still practices the traditional sea courts where the community heads assemble at the place of worship every day, hear and decide on issues within the community.  \r\n\r\nThe Bekal project illustrates more. The government of Keralam has already begun acquiring land as cheaply as possible under public purpose and intends to sell the land to private and multi-national tourist organizations for this same price. To date, there is no Environmental Impact Assessment despite the fact that as planned it would violate national Coastal Regulation Zone rules.  Local community members are being denied due process through hearings that are a sham. \r\n\r\nFortunately, there are organizations that are becoming involved in the process of re-vitalizing community efforts to direct tourism.

Lack of assets, and stable employment lends a view that these peoples are not credit worthy, thus they are barred from a variety of economic opportunities.', 'Organizing groups to support collective and individual credit acquisition, as well as formal and informal skills training can assist peoples in accessing the capital necessary to initiate small businesses and ultimately help build livelihoods for families and communities.', 'A very basic description of the Self-Help Group (SHG) has been summarized by the Rural Finance Learning Center. According to their definition: \"<i> Self-help groups are usually informal clubs or associations of people who choose to come together to find ways to improve their life situations. One of the most useful roles for a self-help group is to provide its members with opportunities to save and borrow and it can act as a conduit for formal banking services to reach their members. Such groups can provide a guarantee system for members who borrow or they may develop into small village banks in their own right. In rural areas self-help groups may be the only way for people to access financial services </i>\" (2006).\r\n\r\nThe structure of the SHG is meant to provide mutual support to the participants by assisting one another in saving money, opening up cooperative banking accounts that help women and other peoples to build credit with a lending institution. The SHG also functions to support members through maintaining consistent contact among group members to aid the individuals savings goals, to help support the creation of these micro-enterprises. Often the SHG helps in the conception of these businesses and even the implementation of these enterprises upon receipt of the micro-loan.\r\n\r\nThe SHG also supports accountability for ensuring that the loans are paid back and the SHG can continue to include other members and support greater access to credit and capital to those within their community. SHGs also provide a space which facilitates the discussion of many issues pertaining to the communitys socio-economic, educational and health status. Thus, the formation of this group provides a forum to initiate many participatory activities (including training and awareness camps). \r\n\r\nThis process has also shown to increase confidence among participants, and help support greater levels of decision-making status in their society, particularly within South Asia. This hopefully will encourage members to participate and contribute in general social and political matters in their respective villages. \r\n\r\nAs peoples are supported in building their credit they in turn are able to apply for micro-loans geared towards a number of self-sufficiency based business ventures. Many of the business commonly financed consist of seamstress shops, beautician parlors, and in the rural areas these business can be as diverse as natural healing clinics, chicken farms and aqua-culture projects, to silk weaving or any number of handcraft based ventures.\r\n\r\nWhile a great number of SHGs have been initiated by communities themselves, many of the SHGs are implemented through the help of an NGO that can provide the initial information and support to establish these groups. Such information and support often consists of training people on how to manage bank accounts to include deposits, withdrawals and balancing of the cooperative and individual accounts. Similarly informal education regarding a number of possible trades can take place in order to build up the capabilities of the participants to function as business owners.\r\n\r\nBut the SHG has some instances shown problems that must be addressed when considering their use as a pattern of community empowerment. For instance, many of these people are in absolute poverty and the little that they do save can put a family in an already precarious financial situation in a worse of place. It can force them to make tough choices as whether to purchase necessary goods such as food, clothing, fuel etc. and risk defaluting on their micro-loans, or in the case of SHGs hurting the entire group\'s ability to take out small loans as these are dependent upon the entire group\'s ability to save and collectively support each other through generating credit.\r\n\r\nOther issues revolve around the nature of work and the family in developing countries where the women are often the primary householder while the male is involved in work outside the house. The creation of these businesses often adds greater levels of work upon women as they are committed to the SHG and the creation of their business to support their income and yet their household duties are still expected to be met by their husbands. In these situations the pressures can be immense to juggle the business, household chores and the rearing of children.\r\n\r\nHowever, in response to some of these problems many NGOs have sought to play a critical role in lessening that burden by offering school to children and thereby giving women members the ability to pursue their career goals by providing a place for their children to go while simultaneously providing education to those children that would otherwise be working at home. Despite some of the draw backs the role of the SHG is still a vital and growing component of bottom-up development, and hopefully eventuating self-designed development in the future', 'Despite the problems some of the participants have faced due to the changing nature of their socio-economic status; the SHGs offer one approach to create associations of support for some of the most economically marginalized groups within society. Through the desire of women and other members of the community these SHGs can provide an organized structure for providing employability and ownership for peoples otherwise left out.\r\n\r\nOverall, communities themselves can act to develop similar groups (or with the aid of NGOs working in the area), as these programs can be realized with relatively little resources from the outside. \r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the SHG is not a panacea to social and economic development, and should only be one part of a larger solution to addressing poverty in communities. Other patterns must be called in to address some of the social consequences that can arise from the creation of an SHG. \r\n\r\nCareful attention must be paid particularly to women as they are often the primary benefactors of the SHG and yet the amount of work involved is no less stressful and difficult for them. Other steps might also be taken to addresses these issues to pursue and integrated approach to supporting development.\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth guide to SHGs see: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/ae536e/ae536e00.HTM\">A handbook for trainers on participatory local development: The Panchayati Raj model in India.</a>', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-05-09 13:25:39', '2008-01-16 00:49:39', NULL, NULL, 'The Public Sphere Project & St. Mary\'s University', NULL, 284, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Following, the 70s and 80s, years often associated with the dark ages of development a new light has come about through alternative practices that seek to employ the communitys themselves in defining their needs, mapping out there assets and coming to terms with their own liabilities.\r\n\r\nThrough a variety of participatory processes both community members and development professionals have had the opportunity to jointly design community improvement schemes that are both appropriate to the community\'s needs and wants, as well sustainable and empowering.\r\n\r\nAs a result of relative success, the role of the community animator has become an increasingly important component for enabling this process of cooperation and participation between the development practitioner and the community members themselves. In some ways the animator acts as both initiator and on-going advocate for his or her community\'s development through regular open communication with both community members and the representative staff working in the area. \r\n\r\nIn the past highly educated teams of researchers and development field workers would enter a community and employ any number of assessment tools to identify community needs. Some of which were participatory in nature (see <a href=>Power Research</a> pattern). Upon return to their offices these assessments would be used to design various projects ranging from indoor lavatories, to treadle pumps, to community telecenters. In many cases it was shown that these projects failed to support the kind of long-term growth in peoples livelihoods they were thought to bring. Rather than looking at what the community wanted or needed from their cultural and social point of reference; these professionals designed projects relative to their point of reference.\r\n\r\nInstead of persisting with this paradigm, NGOs such as the <a href=http://www.iird.interconnection.org> Institute for Integrated Rural Development</a> (IIRD) have pursued vigorous development campaigns in Bangladesh. In this example the community animator has become a central agent for helping to identifiy and express the needs and desires of a community, as well as initiating and supporting change to include, <a href=>informal education</a>, ideas for <a href=><b>micro-enterprise</b></a>, and even supporting the creation of womens <a href=>self-help groups</a> that have enable a number of women in rural areas to gain access to credit and thus empower them to pursue economic generating activities.\r\n\r\nHere organizations such as IIRD would send exploratory panels out to the communities, as a \"get to know you\" campaign. Over a period of time they would identify predominately young men and women that they would sponsor for further education. The pool of students would often serve as the primary group that would go on to perhaps become powerful community animators.\r\n\r\nNot only were they given a valuable education they still retain those familial bonds to their community that often gives them an immediate advantage in having the lived experience of their particular area, as well the rapport of being a community member.\r\n\r\nHowever, problems of jealousy and apprehension can be potentially problematic and it is important that groups and agencies that do seek to draw advocates from the field they seek to assist find ways to mitigate the potential social conflict that might arise. Unfortunately, it may not be possible to completely eliminate it. But it is perhaps a far better approach than previous alternatives', 'The community animator can act as a critical link between the community and any <a  href=>NGO Collaborator</a>. It should be noted that by those in the field for social change that local citizens and activists can often better activate a communitys sentiments and bring about awareness for the possibility to realize change than an outsider who may be perceived to have little understanding of the real issues at stake. \r\n\r\nBeyond the processes of <i>conscientization</i> that a community animator can bring to the process; NGOs can also assist these community members in training for information gathering and needs assessments to help refine the basic kinds of projects and programs that might be of benefit to a community.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-05-09 13:26:20', '2008-01-16 00:52:34', NULL, NULL, 'The Public Sphere Project & St. Mary\'s University', NULL, 284, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Neither community empowerment nor fundamental sustainability plays a central role in many of these interventionist projects. And just as bad, they fail to honor the basic desires and knowledge possessed by these people. Thus displacement, increased unemployment and the overall degeneration of livelihoods becomes the normative result of mis-planned, mis-interpreted and thus, mis-implemented development. Similarly, even among the well-meaning development NGOs a culture of dependence tends to emerge with communities being perpetually tied to the expertise and monetary assets that these organizations bring with them.', 'Before governments, international development agencies and corporate stake holders attempt to define the nature of development for a particular community or region (or for the world for that matter), peoples must proactively assert their own paradigm as a challenge to the problematic realties that have come from vertically planned development schemes, and to break out of dependency.', 'Stepping away from the interventionist model of development, self-designed or autonomous development emphasizes at its core development designed and implemented by the people it is intended to affect. While on one hand this pattern presents an orientation towards the practice and approach of development at one level, at another it is meant to be translated into the direct actions of peoples pursuing the right to define the trajectories of their lives, the lives of their families and their overall communities. It tries to avoid the assumption that all peoples want to be developed, rather it does assume that peoples wish to enjoy a certain type of life defined on their own terms and the hope is that they have the opportunity to realize that desire in their life-time.\r\n\r\nThe words self-designed or autonomous are meant to address the fundamental notions of power, who has it, who uses, and how its used and to what end. As a pattern that values autonomy, but also a notion of development towards greater well-being traditional as well as modern knowledge must be acknowledged, understanding that they do not always have to be perpetually competing forces, but when approached carefully they can be utilized to promote viable path towards community transformation that honors the social, cultural and political realities a community exists within. Thus, the overall basis of the self-designed development places both the responsibility and power of change into the hands of those who have been historically disempowered through the processes of traditional developmentalism.\r\n\r\nAt the level of philosophically orienting this process, its necessary to re-frame development and stress a redefinition of the roles between peoples in communities seeking transformation and the various outside agents who are working for authentic social and economic change. Here we would emphasize <b>facilitation</b> over the management and design on the part of the part of the so-called professional, and community independence and autonomy over dependence. \r\n\r\nTake for example, the Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) (See: <a href=\"\">Action Research</a>) so often thought of as the mainstay of the development practitioner seeking to design projects, becomes instead an awareness tool for community members themselves to guide their own decision making process on what steps are to be taken to better their livelihoods, and offer clear paths to achieving that. In fact this tool can be used by a community without the need for complex levels of understanding into social research and can be used in a relatively low-tech way within a variety of settings. Therefore, the role of the outside agent can be to act as observer and identify ways in which they can help a community realize their mutually defined goals.\r\n\r\nAt the level of implementation the pattern can guide specific actions to be taken up by communities to include any number of projects defined by a community. For example, projects can be anything from a system of check dams used to provide electricity to power a rural village; another project could be the construction of a primary school or health center for women. They can include the creation of farming cooperatives to ensure the community not only achieves the ability to provide sustenance, but can then also generate income by selling their products outside their geographical community.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the use of this pattern at this level will be context specific and must be shaped by the various needs and desires, and including the capacities and capabilities of peoples seeking to pursue this pattern of development. This recognizes that not all communities possess the same needs or desires, nor do the posses the same levels of capacity or capabilities. Therefore in one community where the level of civic capacity is high, as well as a great deal of cohesion and participation among community members, then a more autonomous approach to development is going to be more easily realized. \r\n\r\nYet, to a community that lack a certain level of capacity and cohesion it may be necessary for the community to seek the assistance of an outside agent to facilitate in the process. This could include consciousness raising, financial support, transfer of knowledge and so forth, but fundamentally any such assistance must be a result of the wishes of the community and brought forth based upon the terms and desires of those these plans are meant to assist.\r\n\r\nThere may however, be situations in which such a pattern may not be at all viable, or only very minimally. This is particularly true in situations of displacement, through war, famine or other outside forces that breaks a necessary level of cohesion due to fissure in the very nature of their communal ties, and thereby fragmenting the peoples capacity to coordinate and act collectively. In these situations, the pattern may still be utilized but it will be much more of a goal to be actualized by development agents who are seeking to ameliorate the problems associated with fragmented communities. The pattern thus becomes a guiding force for the interventionist, and care must be taken not to cross the boundary of creating development dependence among peoples.\r\n\r\nIn these situations it can also be potentially problematic as it can be difficult for agencies to relinquish control over development initiatives as community reconstitute themselves and gain a level of independence and cohesion that would allow for them to participate in a process of autonomous development.  And since its difficult to say when the work of an NGO is done in area there remains this tendency maintain a role of interventionism long after a community has acquired the capacity to define their own goals. It therefore begins to become the kind of development the outsiders envision and not that of the community.\r\n\r\nThus, this pattern not only becomes an orientation to community driven development but an orientation and guide by which NGOs themselves can pursue a process to empower communities by emphasizing any number of projects designed to empower peoples to regain control over their lives in the wake of a rapidly modernizing world.', 'First, those among the professional development community should not always assume that a community wishes to be or needs to be developed. Rather support to communities should be pursed based on invitation. For the communities themselves this is an opportunity to empower themselves and to project the ways in which they wish to interact and be defined in the process of modernization that is going on everywhere. It is an opportunity to exert their own sense of identity and influence their livelihoods as best and most effectively as possible in the face of so many outside forces that are consciously and unconsciously seeking to define their collective futures.\r\n\r\nWhen pursuing a development project peoples must come together, discuss, plan and decide what they want. If the community chooses to maintain a traditional way of life it becomes up to them on how they will protect that. And in the event that a community does seek outside assistance it is up to them to define the nature and terms of that relationship to those working with them from the outside. And for those with a low-capacity for truly implementing such an approach any initiative must incorporate the necessity of capacity building for communities to achieve a level in which they can envision their own development. Ultimately, the realization of a communitys independence rather than dependence in this world should be at the fore in such circumstances.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-05-09 13:27:05', '2008-01-16 00:45:42', NULL, NULL, 'The Public Sphere Project & St. Mary\'s University', NULL, 284, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

We continue to spend at Cold War levels despite the fact that, as we are slowly learning, none of the most pressing 21st century threats to security &mdash; terrorism, proliferation, climate change &mdash; are effectively addressed by military force. Why? In part because the livelihoods of millions of people in politically powerful military-dependent institutions and communities are tied to the flow of military dollars.', 'This troubled world is very different today than even a few decades ago. We have more to fear from handfuls of determined terrorists and blowback from the environmental damage we have done than from attack by standing armies. Changing times call for changing strategies, yet people with vested economic interests in the status quo always feel threatened by change. Those convinced that our continued wellbeing depends on redirecting national priorities will find it easier to bring about change if they can reassure people tied into the current system that their economic wellbeing is not at risk.', 'Economic conversion is the process of efficiently transferring people and facilities from military-oriented to civilian-oriented activity. Changing the consequences of substantial military spending cuts from massive job loss to a change in what people produce on the job removes the politically powerful jobs argument. By forcing military programs to be judged on their real contribution to security, conversion is important to more intelligent decision making on national priorities. \r\n\r\nHuge military budgets are ineffective in facing down 21st century threats to security. Obviously, military spending offers no advantage in confronting the threat of increasingly severe weather events (hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods) that, with other environmental disasters, appear directly linked to global warming. Less obviously but equally true, military force is of little use in confronting terrorist threats. The worlds most powerful military did nothing to prevent or stop the 9-11 attacks. Virtually every terrorist caught, every terrorist plot foiled has been the result of first-rate intelligence and police work, not the threat or use of military force. Military force has also been useless in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\r\n\r\nNot only is high military spending ineffective in addressing the most pressing security threats, it is also a serious drain on economic strength, one of the most important sources of national wellbeing and international influence. This idea is hardly new in economics, going back to Adam Smith, the 18th century founder of capitalism. Smith argued that military spending was economically unproductive. Decades ago, economists commonly used military burden almost synonymously with military budget. \r\n\r\nToday, the problem is the same, but some mechanisms are different. Large numbers of highly skilled engineers and scientists are needed to develop modern technologically sophisticated military weapons and related systems. But engineers and scientists are also critical to modern civilian industry. They develop new technologies that improve products and processes, driving the growth of productivity, which allows producers to pay higher wages and still keep prices low. Rising wages and low prices are the recipe for increasing economic prosperity. Quality products at low prices are also key to keeping industries competitive with rivals abroad, and therefore to keeping unemployment low and profits strong.\r\n\r\nBy directing the nations technological talent away from developing the technologies civilian-oriented producers need, huge military budgets drain a nations economic vitality. This is one reason for both the collapse of the Soviet Union and the de-industrialization of the United States. Thus, there are compelling economic and security arguments for re-orienting national priorities. Economic conversion facilitates this process. \r\n\r\nWhen World War II ended, the U.S. transferred 30 percent of its economic output from military-oriented to civilian-oriented activity in one year (1945-46) without unemployment rising above 3 percent. That remarkable feat, which depended on advanced planning by the private sector <i>and</i> government, successfully reconverted an economy that had moved into military production during the war back to producing the civilian products it made before the war. Though the scale is smaller today, the problem is more complicated. Unlike the 1940s reconversion, most of those working today in what President Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex have never done anything but military-oriented work. And the difference between military and civilian-oriented activity has become much greater. The process is no longer one of going back to what is familiar; it is now a move to new work in a very different environment.\r\n\r\nFor example, military sector engineers today are under enormous pressure to squeeze every ounce of performance out of products they design. With enormous military budgets, cost is not nearly as important an issue. Civilian sector products must perform well, but keeping cost low is absolutely critical. Engineering for maximum performance with little attention to cost is very different from engineering for low cost with reasonable performance. To successfully transfer from military to civilian work, engineers must be retrained (given some different skills) and re-oriented (taught to look at engineering from a different perspective). In general, more specialized and skilled people require more retraining and re-orientation. \r\n\r\nConverting facilities and equipment requires assessing their character and condition to find the best match to productive civilian use. From 1961-1981, more than 90 U.S. military bases were closed and converted to industrial parks, research centers, college campuses, and airports --- with a net 20 percent <i>increase</i> in employment. In the 1990s, Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, Texas was converted to a booming civilian airport. In October 2005, the nuclear weapons complex at Rocky Flats, Colorado was closed, and the land on which it stood is being turned into a National Wildlife Refuge. \r\n\r\nThe conversion movement in the U.S. began in the 1970s and grew through the early 1990s. In 1977, bi-partisan sponsors introduced the National Economic Conversion Act in the Senate, and soon after in the House of Representatives. Repeatedly reintroduced through the years, it never became law. If it had, the decentralized nationwide private and public sector process of conversion planning and support it would have set up would have prevented the economic shockwave that military dependent workers and communities felt in the late 1980s/early 1990s, and made it politically much easier to forestall the subsequent return to Cold War military spending levels. \r\n\r\nGiven the urgent need to redirect the nations attention and resources to address the economic and security realities of the 21st century, economic conversion has never been more important. Through letters, town hall meetings and personal visits, our representatives in the Congress must learn that reducing the military drain on our economy is critical to rebuilding the American middle class, repairing our decaying national infrastructure, and addressing the real problems of homeland security. Working with existing citizens organizations, conversion can help build alliances among the growing number of businesspeople who oppose the unilateralist militarism that has poisoned the nations image abroad, workers who see themselves going backwards, and environmentalists who want the nation to free the resources necessary to stop the slow motion disaster of global warming.', 'Conversion defines economic alternatives for those tied into institutions of militarism and war anywhere, helping build support for redirecting national priorities toward more effective, nonmilitary solutions to real national security needs.

If an individual changes, this may require compensatory changes in those close to the individual.  Thus, there is often resistance to change at the level of family and friends as well.

Often, teachers and administrators use the asymmetrical power relationships inherent in most educational settings to promulgate their own set of values deliberately. Even when not done deliberately, values are communicated. Yet, neither the conscious nor the implicit promulgation of values is typically designed with thought to the appropriateness of these values to the future.  This is not to claim that newer values are always better than older values; but it is to claim that at least some values of the past need to be re-thought in the light of huge global populations, diminishing natural resources, and the danger and ultimate futility of armed conflict.', 'Children normally develop with age morally as well as cognitively (Piaget, 1964; Kohlberg, 1989).  Optimally this comes about through acting in the social world, observing consequences, and interacting with peers.  Turiel (1983) pointed out that children develop judgments in two separate but inter-related domains, one conventional and one ethical.  The appropriateness of clothing is a question of convention that varies from society to society and setting to setting.  The appropriateness of killing is an ethical issue in every society.  However, if one flaunts a known convention (e.g., appearing nude when inappropriate), it can cause enough disruption and discomfort to cause true ethical issues.  \r\n\r\nTo avoid simply having students parrot back platitudes without deep understanding, an approach to values education has been proposed that uses moral dilemmas for discussion and encouraging the participation in communities where conflicts and resolutions will be a natural outgrowth (Nucci & Weber, 1991).  While values in education has always been an important issue, our contemporary context puts special emphasis on this issue.    \r\n\r\nThe world is changing at a rapid rate and many of today\'s implicit \"values\" are counter-productive to a viable future (e.g., judging an individual\'s worth by the size and power of their automobile; believing that a child must live constantly in an environment kept at 70-72 degrees Fahrenheit; that authority is always right and must be obeyed; that the way to success is to follow the crowd).  Indeed, many values perpertrated by society are contradictory.  For instance, American society encourages over-indulgence in high fat, high sugar foods and simultaneously insists that only people with perfect bodies are worthwhile.  While children may be taught during an hour-long health class that too much fat and sugar are bad for the body, this hardly constitutes a sufficient antidote to thousands of expertly designed advertisements that say just the opposite.  The capacity of adults to wreak great havoc on others is at an all-time high.  Ethical decisions have always been crucial, but the consequences of unethical behavior are greater.', 'Education is often thought of as a process that helps individuals gain knowledge (vocabulary, rules of syntax, geographic locations, events of historic significance) and skills (parsing sentences, doing research, organizing results, writing, typing).  While this is true, education also necessarily promotes values.  Values are involved in curriculum choices, the materials chosen within that curriculum, how the material is presented, and in the range of correct answers.    For example, if history focuses primarily on the history of ones own country, this promotes the value of chauvinism.  If, within that history, the emphasis is on Presidents, Generals, wars, and victories (with little to say about changes that arise from and affect people in general) then that promotes the values of authoritarianism and militarism. If material focuses on white Christian males, that promotes racism and sexism. If the material is taught lecture style with little chance for debate, discussion, or dialogue, then this further reinforces the value of authoritarianism.  If the evaluation of the students progress is based primarily on the ability to recite specific known facts, this further promotes the value of authoritarianism.  \r\n\r\n	A study published in the American Psychologist a few decades ago showed that the best predictor of college grades in introductory psychology classes was not high school GPA or SAT scores but the degree of agreement in values between instructor and student.  An interesting case study of the degree to which values are inherent even in so-called objective matters comes from the Ph.D. dissertation of Evans, a student of Minsky at MIT.  Evans built an AI program to solve multiple choice figure analogy problems.  A:B::C:D1, D2, D3, D4, or D5.    The program found relationships mapping between A and B and then tried to apply those same relationships mapping C to each of the possible D answers.  His program worked.  In fact, his program worked too well.  According to his program, all the answers were correct.  In order to make the program pick the same answers as the test makers, he had to inculcate his program with the same priorities of values that the test makers had.  For instance, according to them, it was (implicitly) more elegant to rotate a figure within the 2-D plane rather than to rotate out in 3-space.  \r\n\r\nThe inculcation of values is a pervasive and subtle process.  Much of the value indoctrination that schools engage in is done unconsciously.  Even when conscious attention is given to values, there seems to be little appreciation of the extent to which children are subjected to much more powerful indoctrination via paid advertisements via print, TV, radio, games, and movies.', 'Educational institutions, individual teachers, parents, concerned citizens and children themselves must work to uncover and understand the values that are being taught as well as to design the entire educational experience to foster those values that will help make for a sustainable and healthy future.  For a whole school approach to values, see http://www.valueseducation.edu.au/values/ \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, a constructivist approach to education, while arguably important for deep understanding in topics as various as science and mathematics to poetry interpretation, such an approach is particularly vital to values education, and especially when values of the past may have to be re-thought for their appropriateness to the future.

Unfortunately, the increasing size and complexity of these problems and the corresponding \"appropriate actions\" that are required introduce a set of thorny issues that must be addressed for these actions to be effective.', 'This pattern can be used in situations where a distributed, diverse, dynamic group of people are working towards complementary goals in complex, collaborative efforts.', 'The ability of people to form effective \"Open Action and Research Networks\" is critical to the success of any attempt at significant social and environmental amelioration. It is also an approach that is only now being explored. For that reason, the concept &mdash; and this pattern &mdash; reflect the uncertainty and ambiguity that is inherent in the situation. \r\n\r\nAs we have said before, most of the daunting problems that we face today are large and complex. Grappling with large and complex problems is invariably best served when addressed by many people working together.  Indeed this is often the case as each \"stakeholder\" in any situation can be said to be \"working\" on the problem. Yet each person and organization working on the problem has a unique orientation which can be at odds with others. \"Orientation\" is a broad term that includes reward structures; goals, tactics, and strategies; areas of interests; obligations and allegiances; values and norms, status, legitimacy, and power; and ultimately, the very language that the community uses to discuss the issues. Consider, for example, the wide range of people who are working to minimize the negative effects of global climate change, or what Margaret Keck calls an \"ecology of agents.\"  These people include scientists, activists, inventers,  green business people, educators, politicians, and ordinary people among others, and these people are as often as not members of other organizations and networks with diverse goals and varying resources and abilities to influence others. \r\n\r\nIt is against and within this complex environment that the stakeholder players must act / interact. This diverse group of people &mdash; of continually shifting size, shape, orientation and <i>modus operandi</i> &mdash; can scarcely be called a \"team\" since teams (particularly in sports) have a single objective. It is clear that many of the \"players\" working in these new \"open networks\" have similar objectives, working for example, for social and environmental ameliorization, and these players will come from a multitude of communities: some are interested in research, some action, some the creation of policy, some physical or material changes right now, while others are interested in abstract goals to be attained in the indeterminate future. In the worst case, the diversity of the players destroys the team. Ideally the diversity is the source of its strength. (Indeed diversity of thinking is essential to effective strategy [See <a href=\"http://www.publicsphereproject.org/patterns/pattern.pl/public?pattern_id=503\">Strategic Capacity</a> pattern].) \r\n\r\nAccording to Ganz, \"the task of devising strategy in complex, changing environments may require interaction among team members like the performance of a jazz ensemble. As a kind of distributed cognition, it may require synthesizing skills and information beyond the ken of any one individual, making terms of that interaction particularly important.\" Nearly opposite to the \"ensemble\" idea is the impossible vision of \"herding cats\" in which each \"cat\" is totally unconcerned about the doings of the other \"cats.\"\r\n\r\nThe networks that this pattern must address vary tremendously. At one end of the scale there are networks with few members and resources, short duration, and informal procedures. At the other end are networks like the LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) Network that was started in 1980, involves 26 sites in the US, and over 1,800 scientists and students. Although the LTER Network is fairly well financed (by the National Science Foundation) and is more formal and less diverse than some groups, the networks on both ends of the scale do share many points in common befitting their structure as <I>networks of semi-autonomous peers</I>. \r\n\r\nSome of the questions that this \"network approach\" should ultimately address are as follows: <ul><li>How can differences of opinion be \"managed\" &mdash; i.e. encouraged to some degree, while not allowing them to become destructive?</li><li>How is coordination and cooperation accomplished without coercion? </li><li> How can we cooperatively evolve useful modes of organization and engagement that are especially suited for these new environments and ensembles?</li><li>How can people maintain respect for allies who have other perspectives and capitalize effectively on the diversity of the ensemble? </li><li>How do efforts survive personnel change by ensuring that relevant information, including facts, lessons learned and intriguing opportunities are made available to new members? <li>How can environmental scientists and other types of researchers (including social scientists) conduct research that meets the demands of their profession and the needs of the communities they are working with?</li><li>How  are conflicts and misunderstandings over short-term and long-term goal reconciled?</li></ul>Each organizational type (and each organization!) has its own orientation which encompasses its thinking and acting and it is this orientation which is likely to be challenged when working with others. \r\n\r\nShared concerns and principles help bring people together into groups, organizations and networks. Beyond that, however, other things are also critical. The individuals within the network should be able to work with other people to solve problems collectively and to help maintain cordiality and integrity within the group. Also because the membership of these networks is dynamic, there must be ways to bring in new members easily. Besides shared values and shared ideas about the roles, interests and constraints of the other players, there should be shared goals. Goals and other forms of collective, documented statements or plans, <i>however symbolic they might be</i> can provide coherence over time. \r\n\r\nMargaret Keck\'s work in Brazil provides an excellent example of the power that these documents can have. In 1971, the Solu&ccedil;&atilde;ao Integrada (Integrated Solution) was included as the sanitation component of the metropolitan development plan. Although it was abandoned by the following government and replaced by a more expensive, less popular and more environmentally degrading plan called SANEGRAN. According to Keck, the very existence of the plan made it \"possible for non-technical social and political actors to challenge public authority on water policy.\" In fact, in more striking terms, the plan, \"Like a shadow government existing in counter point to sitting ones, the plan has functioned as a shadow sanitation plan for Sao Paulo for more  than a quarter century, making critical action more possible\" (Keck, 2001). \r\n\r\nGirard and Stark (2006) point out the importance of agreeing on general philosophical aims among disparate groups without descending into micromanagement or debate. Sharing of ideas, documents and information was the also general aim of the Telecommunications Policy Roundtable, that met monthly in Washington, DC, in the 1990s to help build a general  public interest policy for the Internet and other informaiton technologies. The LTER Network, as a body of researchers, places data in a central postion for their work and has developed specific formats to encourage the develop and sharing of data as well as policies for its use in a loosely coupled network configuration (Karasti and Syrj&auml;nen, 2004). \r\n\r\nToday\'s phenomenon of creating movies with a team that was assembled for the purpose of making a single movie is instructive. Clearly reputation and \"who you know\" play some part in the selection of individuals. Once on the set, however, the person\'s skill-set, role in the enterprise, and ability to work with others in a dynamic milieu where unexpected events ma arise, is put to the test.  While the \"Open Networks\" we discuss here are not identical, the agility, intelligence, and effectiveness that these groups can potentially manifest is huge.', 'Acknowledge the importance of this pattern and work consciously to identify the inherent dilemmas of the situation as well as the emerging wisdom that is to be learned from the practice.

(687, 667, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'Communities face a wide variety of challenges in areas of health, education, economic development, sustainable environments, and social order.  But regardless of the difficulty of these challenges, a necessary condition for addressing them is for communities to find ways for members to work together.  Too often, community members work at cross purposes and fail to develop what Jane Addams (1912, Nov. 2) called the capacity for affectionate interpretation, resulting in what John Dewey (1927) called the eclipse of the public.  Community inquiry is what Addams and Dewey called their theory and practice for reshaping communities and, thus, society at large.', 'The challenges for constructive communities are as old as humanity and there will never be an absolute or universal solution to them.  One reason is that every member of a community has unique experiences in life and thus unique perspectives, beliefs, and values.  This diversity can be a source of strength within communities, but it can also lead to frustration, disappointment, conflict, and even violence.  Diverse institutions have been created to address community challenges, including public libraries, public schooling, procedures for democratic governance, and venues for free expression.  Often, however, these institutions are reduced from their idealized conception.  With community inquiry, diversity becomes a resource and institutions are knit together productively.', 'As Jane Addams pointed out in founding Chicagos Hull-House, the first settlement house in the U.S. (Addams, 1912), and Dewey examined through the creation of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, democracy has been more realized in its political than its social expression. That is, even when formal procedures are established and maintained, meaningful participation is by no means guaranteed. For example, a public library might offer a large collection of books available at no charge to members of the community, but meaningful use of those materials depends also on available public transportation, broad-scale development of literacy skills, and a social organization that makes people feel welcome.  In this and many other examples, it is clear that the problem goes beyond institutions, structures, and procedures, requiring instead the means by which every member of the community comes into the process of authority.\r\n\r\nCommunity inquiry provides a theoretical and action framework for people to come together to develop shared capacity and work on common problems in an experimental and critical manner. \r\nThe word community signals support for collaborative activity and for creating knowledge that is connected to people\'s values, history, and lived experiences. Inquiry points to support for open-ended, democratic, participatory engagement. \r\n\r\nConsider the case of East St. Louis.  Its widely noted dissolution and destruction (Kozol, 1991) resulted from many factors, both internal and external.  The integration of housing in neighboring cities had the perverse effect of East St. Louis losing most of its middle class and professional workers.  Racism, both within and towards the city, was a key factor that led to its failure to get the resources it needed to maintain a vibrant community.  Problems compounded as elements within the city began to pull in different directions, often serving their own ends at the expense of the larger community.  For example, companies dumped hazardous waste and landlords allowed buildings to become dilapidated and dangerous.  From a community inquiry perspective, East St. Louis exhibited a failure for democratic, participatory engagement and demonstrated little evidence of people within the city or larger entitiesstate and nationalcoming together with shared values and goals. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, East St. Louis has survived and in some aspects has developed the capacity to thrive.  Community members have come together to address the severe problems they faced.  Substantial assets, such as the talent and dedication of Katherine Dunham, have taken enduring form in her museums and international dance workshops for children (http://www.eslarp.uiuc.edu/kdunham/).  The community collaborates with other organizations, such the University of Illinois; their joint East St. Louis Action Research Project (http://www.eslarp.uiuc.edu) has helped improve conditions in the city by setting up, for example, community technology centers, new housing, a light rail station, and a youth-driven community theater.  At the same time, ESLARP has provided new opportunities for university students, staff, and faculty who have worked in the community.  \r\n\r\nA key element of the work in East St. Louis is that it reflects continuing inquiry by people who are invested in the community in a variety of ways.  That is, successes to date have not come from outsiders dictating and delivering solutions, but by bringing together participants from diverse perspectives to work together.  Moreover, this work, while it addresses very practical problems of jobs, environment, health, education, cultural preservation and enrichment, and so forth, does not stop there.  Instead, local action becomes a means through which the residents and those outside learn more about the community and its possibilities.  In that sense, inquiry is both action and understanding. The lesson from East St. Louis, and similar communities, is that the process of community inquiry is ultimately of greater importance than the solving a specific problem.\r\n\r\nWe see many additional examples around the world of the power of community inquiry.  In the domain of community development and learning, for example, a National Science Foundation study carried out in rural villages around Bangladesh related the finding that material from well-worn saris supplied a filtering material that worked better in reducing cholera than the nylon mesh that microbiologists had developed (Recer, 2003).  In Reggio Emilia, Italy, with few of the resources found in affluent and advanced communities, families and teachers developed an innovative approach to education, now heralded throughout the world, that recognizes the potential of all children to learn and grow in relation with others, through the hundred languages of doing, being, reflecting, and knowing (http://www.reggioalliance.org). Community inquiry can also be manifested in the development of information and communication technology.  See, for example, the culturally situated design tools developed collaboratively between Renssalear Polytechnic Institute and its community partners (http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/csdt.html) and the Community Inquiry Laboratory software created collectively by the University of Illinois and its partners around the world, who come from all walks of life (http://ilabs.inquiry.uiuc.edu).', 'Therefore: When a community faces some problem, think of it not simply as something to be fixed but rather as an opportunity for the community to come together, to build capacity, and to learn about itself and its situation in a manner that can be joyful and intellectually stimulating.  Recognize that every member of the community has knowledge that may be critical to solving that problem but can be discovered only if that individual has a voice and a say in what the community does.  Recognize also that most problems are not solvable in one step and even when they are, may recur in the future.  Thus, it is critical for the community to not only fix its problems but to become an organism capable of further inquiry.  The communitys knowledge about how to deal with challenges is not in fixed procedures but rather in the capacity to learn through ongoing action, or what Dewey called experimental knowing.  \r\n\r\nWe have created a diagram to represent this cycle of ongoing community inquiry (see below): a spiral of asking questions, investigating solutions, creating new knowledge as we gather information, discussing our discoveries and experiences, and reflecting on our new-found understanding.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-05-28 10:54:24', '2007-03-18 13:27:47', 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', NULL, 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', NULL, 343, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

She said, \"There are 23 families living on the street in this barrio. In eight years what has this government done for them? In three years what has this Committee done for them? They need help now! What are we going to do for them now?\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"we\" that Nidia was talking about was the Urban Land Committee for the Andres Bello barrio. The Urban Land Committees (...) exist everywhere there are barrios in Venezuela and barrios are everywhere in Venezuela (...)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When barrio problems are discussed (...) the most common suggestion is to get organized. At the Andres Bello meeting, barrio resident Hector Madera said, When the people of our barrio have a problem they mustnt rely on the media, or go and whisper in the ear of a friend in a Chavista party, we need to organize ourselves.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nidia Lopez felt the best way the Andres Bello CTU could help the 23 homeless families was to take the appeal to the President. Everybody else in the meeting argued it was more important that organization happen first.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The families should (...) discuss with each other about what they wanted. They should also talk with the owner of the mansion. Only then should they approach the government for assistance if they still needed it.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madera said the barrios needed to organize together, \"When organized we can involve the people from nearby barrios, like Chapellin, and get their support. We will help them and them us. Together we solve our problems ourselves. We can march together.\"\r\n	( Source: Entitled to Democracy:Venezuelas Urban Land Committees and Participatory Democracy.

They encompass all the occasions in which issues and needs of general importance to a community or a society are discussed, contested, and decided. They may be open and democratic, but very often they explicitly or implicitly bar certain groups, certain perspectives, and certain issues. How they filter participants and ideas is an important quality to investigate.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the meetings and debates that seek to influence community-wide matters take place in government institutions, an increasing proportion occur in voluntary associations, social movement groupings, and invitation-only meetings.  Internet discussions demonstrate the growing importance of virtual political settings and raise questions about how they differ from face-to-face meetings and how uneven access to computers affects political outcomes. The rules and culture of each setting influence the quality of communication, deliberation, and decision-making it embodies. Are they open or secret? Which voices do they amplify or exclude? What about women, poor people, people of low status, different cultures, different religions?  What impact do they have?\r\n\r\nThe idea of political setting draws upon ecological psychologys concept of \"behavior settings,\" but it puts the focus on activity that aims to influence public policy.  It opens the door for a search of the evolving pattern language exemplified in the face-to-face political actions from below that are emerging in meetings and demonstrations around the world with all their limitations as well as their strengths.', 'Seeing and analyzing popular politics through the lens of political settings promises to generate a useful and realistic view of the political resources available for popular action and of the obstacles that such action faces.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-06-01 13:00:18', '2007-06-14 13:42:23', NULL, NULL, 'University of Toronto', NULL, 312, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Characters can serve as sources of inspiration for all; they can give us hope in dire times; they can serve as models for ethical, effective, or clever behavior.

(704, 684, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'The cost of journals and books has risen to the point where libraries, let alone individual scholars, can barely afford them.  This is not because the payments to authors have risen dramatically.  Far from it.  Nor have publishing costs skyrocketed.  Instead, there has been a dramatic consolidation in the publishing industry along with skyrocketing profits, far faster than, for instance, the general rises in the cost of living.  In addition, with the consolidation in the retail bookstores as well as publishers, the publishes concentrate their efforts disproportionately on textbooks that will have large markets.  Moreover, even if publishing profits were driven to zero, there would still be many people in the world who would not be able to gain access to important scientific and scholarly information in the form of paper books and journals.', 'There are many scholars, scientists, and teachers in a wide variety of fields.  Only a very small percentage gain a significant amount of income from the publication of their scholarly works.  In fact, in many cases, authors have to pay page charges to have their work published. Publishing companies make a lot of money.  Yet, people who could gain greatly from the knowledge in books and articles cannot afford them. Not only do most scholars receive little, no, or negative income for publishing their work; the amount of work that they are expected to do has increased,  Not too many years ago, authors sent in a paper manuscript and the publishing companies were responsible for typesetting and copy editing.  Today, most publishers require computer-readable files completely formatted and expect the author to carefully check for typos, grammatical errors, word usage, etc..  In other words, the author now does much of the work that publishers used to do, but all the resultant reduction in costs have been added to the profits of publisher rather than to any benefits to the authors.', 'Probably the best introduction to the important concepts in Open Access (OA) Scholarly Publishing can be found at the Open Access Overview website: \r\nhttp://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm\r\nAmong other important points,some important myths about OA are debunked. OA is not cost-free, for instance, although clearly, it can be less expensive than traditional use of a paper publishing company.  Even if not completely cost-free, it can still be free to the readers.  There are a number of different models of funding. In some cases, the authors pay a small fee; in others, institutions pay; in still others (e.g., NSF), granting agencies make OA a condition of acceptance.  It is also pointed out that there is no necessary relationship between quality and whether something is paper published.  OA journals support peer-review, high standards and editing (at least) as easily as paper media.  OA archives typically permit researchers to post non-reviewed white papers, drafts, etc.  OA projects do well to use the OAI metadata standards so that others may search works seamlessly across organizational boundaries. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the best-known current example of open access publishing is the cooperative project known as the \"Wikipedia\" but there are many others.  While the \"Wikipedia\" has historically not been peer-reviewed in any strong sense, this is not a prerequisite of the idea of open access to scholarly literature.  There are a variety of open-access journals (See the Directory of Open Access Journals at: http://www.doaj.org/ ) and open-access repositories (See Directory of Open Access Repositories at: http://www.opendoar.org/).  \r\n\r\nIn other related efforts, MIT is making all its course material available online; MERLOT is a cooperative project across many universities in the United States to share course materials.  There are similar projects in Europe and Canada. \r\n\r\nOne example illustrating some of these concepts is the Global Text Project. THE GLOBAL TEXT PROJECT - Engaging many for the benefit of many more.  While even individuals and libraries in the United States find it difficult to afford books and journals, these items in many in the developed world are completely beyond reach.  In many countries, the price for the textbooks equivalent to the requirements for a single year of undergraduate college is higher than the median gross net income.  The Global Text Project website (http://globaltext.org) states their goal as the provision of a library of 1000 free electronic textbooks for the developing world.  These would comprise all the texts needed for undergraduates in every major.  Many of the participants have experience with creating a free textbook about XML.  The next two planned projects are for texts on management and on Information Technology.  \r\n\r\nThe project seems feasible.  Most scholars in the developed world are relatively wealthy compared with the developing world. Contributing to the education of other parts of the world can ultimately help developing countries lower disease rates and improve economic conditions, lower the probability of civil war, corruption and starvation.  In turn, this increases the chances for more education in a virtuous cycle.  In addition, contributing to such projects offers scholars the opportunity for enhancing their reputation and getting valuable feedback from other colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some advantages to print media.  It is nice to be able to \"own\" an actual book or journal and annotate it.  In some ways, the distinctive covers and form factors of books can serve as a helpful retrieval cue to the material inside in a way that websites typically do not.  However, having books and journals online also has distinct advantages over and above the tremendous difference in costs.  On line books allows one to search for keywords, put related passages on the screen side by side, apply automatic summarization techniques, run software to check spelling, grammar, difficulty level and easily reformat.  On line books can also contain hyperlinks to other scholarly (or non-scholarly) work and websites. \r\n\r\nThere are other significant advantages to Open Source Publishing.  Because the overall price is so much less (less cost and less concern with profit) publishing in a multitude of languages becomes feasible.  In addition, for the same reason, a much wider variety of materials may be published.  By way of contrast, textbook publishers tend to focus their efforts on books for very popular and required courses.\r\n\r\nWhile this discussion has focused so far on the benefits of open source scholarly publishing to potential readers and society generally and has argued that there is little financial disincentive for most scholarly authors, a study by Antelman (2004) indicates that they may actually be substantial benfeits to authors as well. In her study of citations for articles in four fields (philosophy, political science, electrical engineering and mathematics) she found in each case a highly significant difference in favor of open source articles.  Other studies confirming this trend show an increase in range from 50% to 250% (See Steve Hitchcock\'s bibliography at: http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html).', 'Provide ways (e.g., via open access journals, open repositories, etc.) for scholars to jointly create and improve scholarly materials, have them peer-reviewed and disseminated to those who can learn and critique the information without always engaging the additional costs and gate-keeping properties of traditional paper publishers.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-06-10 08:00:00', '2007-05-16 14:40:55', NULL, NULL, 'IBM Research Hawthorne', NULL, 105, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

(706, 686, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 'Supporting group interaction around a shared document is challenging for designers of two-dimensional interfaces and asynchronous, text-based groupware.   The need to <i>deliberate</i> (collaborate, make decisions, or make comments) around documents appears to be one of the main reasons why groups that could otherwise interact virtually and asynchronously via the Internet choose to meet synchronously, either in person or online, often in a richer environment than text-only (e.g. including audio, video, and/or a 3-D environment). \r\n\r\nWhen some or all stakeholders are unable to participate in synchronous meetings, distributed asynchronous interaction offers many advantages to groups deliberating about documents: more time for reflection, revision, and information seeking (cf. Holland and Stornetta, 1992); the ability to accommodate people\'s conflicting schedules; flexible interaction modes through conversion of text to/from speech (e.g. for disabled or less literate users); the easier access, storage, and search afforded by digital archives; and (Price and Cappela, 2002) the empowerment of those who are at a disadvantage when participation involves speaking in a live group.  But mapping in-person meetings onto an asynchronous interaction through distributed 2-D text displays entails several types of lost richness, including nonverbal grounding cues (Clark and Brennan, 1991), spatial depth, the natural use of separate perceptual modalities for document (visual) and discussion (auditory); and the use of a shared temporal progression to guide attention.', 'In our usage, a <i>document</i> can be in any format, including images, audio and video, but our primary focus here is on digital documents in which most of the information is in text.  Discussion that takes place around a document consists of <i>comments</i> that pertain either to the document as a whole or to some part of it.  The document may be either fixed or evolving as the discussion around it proceeds, but the document assumes an elevated status over the comments made about it, e.g. because it has been chosen for careful discussion, or because its final version  will have governing consequences or will represent the outcome of a collaboration.  In the latter cases, the group must somehow reach a <i>decision</i> relating to the document (e.g. to adopt it).', '[NOTE: This pattern focuses on interfaces for visually-abled users.  Adapting the analysis presented here for visually impaired users might be possible, but our feeling is that that will require quite a different approach, one we hope to investigate in the future.]\r\n\r\nThe projection of a 3-D, multi-modality, co-located, synchronous deliberation experience onto a 2-D, primarily visual,  distributed asynchronous interaction requires essential aspects of face-to-face deliberation to be remapped onto a screen interface.   The needed mappings can be judged according to two broad goals:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Visible relationships.</b> Relationships between comments and the texts they reference, between different comments, and between group members and the document and discussion, should be as visible as possible.</li>\r\n<li><b>Distinguishable boundaries.</b> Separations between contextually related and unrelated text and comments and between individual authors of documents and comments should be as distinguishable as possible.</li> </ul>\r\n\r\nLet us consider each of these goals in more detail.\r\n\r\n<b>Visible Relationships</b>\r\n\r\nExhibiting relationships between the components of document-centered deliberation (document, comments, and participants) implies a number of refinements of this goal.  First, the document text that is the target of deliberation should be <i>co-visible</i> (displayed simultaneously) with comments around it, and the identities of comment authors and document text, when relevant, should also be co-visible with their output.  Second, the referencing relationship between a comment and its target text should be visible, i.e. the interface should incorporate <i>ostensive pointing</i> (meaning that a pointing relationship is displayed on the screen rather than being enacted through a peripheral device) and <i>in-text placement</i> of comments.  Third, response relationships between comments should be visible through <i>threading</i>. And fourth, the reactions of deliberation participants should be visible through <i>polling and decision features</i>.\r\n  \r\n<b>Distinguishable Boundaries</b>\r\n\r\nVisible relationships can be inadequate, as anyone would know who has used a map with ambiguous place labelings.  The interface should also mark boundaries between text that is and is not the reference target of a comment, e.g. though <i>text highlighting</i>.  Text authored by different people at different times should be distinguishable through <i>textual boundaries</i>. The topic of a text should be able to be viewed separately from its main body through <i>headers. And obsolete comments (i.e. made on a previous version) should be recognizable through pertinence markers</i>.', 'Applying the principles of relationship visibility and boundary distinguishability in an integrated way puts online deliberators at less of a disadvantage relative to their face-to-face counterparts.  The Deme environment for online deliberation (Davies et al., forthcoming) is a tool for document-centered discussion, polling and decision making that incorporates all of the elements derived above in a dynamically updating (no-page-reload) interface.  \r\n\r\nThe summary image shows the most recent design of the <i>meeting area viewer</i> in Deme.  The shaded-in header of a comment in the discussion view pane on the right points to a shaded-in comment reference in the text of a document shown in the item view pane on the left.\r\n\r\nDeme provides co-visibility between document and comments through an optional split-screen view.  In-text comment references are transiently pointed to (the dotted-line arrow goes away as soon as the user scrolls) when clicked on, and comments are displayed in the context of hierarchical threads.  Members can vote on documents under a variety of decision rules.  Boundaries are provided through highlighting, text boundaries, headers, and a versioning system that remembers when comments become obsolete and marks them as such.  The design takes advantage of no-page-reload web server calls to provide dynamic relationship visibility and boundary distinguishability.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2006-06-10 08:00:00', '2008-12-11 11:47:46', 'Stanford University', 'Stanford University', 'Stanford University', 'Stanford University', 357, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Brendan O\'Connor', 'Aaron Tam'),
